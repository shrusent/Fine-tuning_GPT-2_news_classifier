# Fine-tuning_GPT-2_news_classifier


This project is a part of a Machine Learning course. 

# Creation of custom dataset:

The data was scraped from multiple technological websites and political news websites using newspaper3k. This was used to create a custom dataset by filtering only English news(can be found in news_data.csv). The dataset was then used to fine-tune a GPT-2 transformer model to classify the news articles into technology and politics. An example of prediction is also shown.
