"You could say that Fortnite is entering a new phase. With the launch of Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival, the game is now more than a popular battle royale — it’s a platform designed to house lots of different kinds of experiences. That shift was preceded by an event that brought the game back to its roots with Fortnite OG, which returned to the original battle royale map alongside classic weapons and vehicles. And that was a very intentional strategy from Epic Games.

According to Epic’s executive VP Saxs Persson, the launch of Fortnite OG was meant to create a stir ahead of this rollout of new games. “We had a goal of re-activating a lot of our 500 million accounts that maybe weren’t playing Fortnite anymore, and thought Fortnite was just battle royale,” he explains. “You need them to pay attention to see this is actually very different than what we were six years ago. OG was the first step.” It certainly seems to have worked in that regard; Epic previously said that Fortnite had 100 million players in November, the game’s best month ever.

The second step is this week’s rollout of those three Epic-developed games, each aimed at a different audience. It’s still too early to tell if any of them will be a hit, but early signs are encouraging. At the time of this writing, nearly 2 million people were playing Lego Fortnite, while more than 800,000 were playing Fortnite Festival, both of which had topped the traditional battle royale. Persson says the goal isn’t necessarily to surpass the game’s current main mode, though.",technology
"According to the IOC, eight Russian and three Belarusian athletes have so far qualified for Paris 2024 | Marc Piasecki/Getty Images

Germany’s sports minister, Nancy Faeser, has called on the International Olympic Committee to examine “very carefully” the backgrounds of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in next year’s Olympic Games in Paris.

Faeser’s comments came a day after the IOC, headed by Germany’s Thomas Bach, announced that Russians and Belarusians would be able to compete in Paris as neutrals outside of team events, provided they did not actively support the war against Ukraine.

But Faeser, who is also Germany’s interior minister, said that it was important the IOC examine their backgrounds and exclude any athletes found to support President Vladimir Putin’s war, or have any connection to the Russian government or military.

“The warmonger Putin must under no circumstances use the Olympic Games in Paris for his propaganda,” said Faeser, in a statement sent to POLITICO.

In March, the IOC recommended that international sports could reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes as individuals, under a neutral banner, as long as they had not supported the war and that they were not under contract with either the army or national security agencies.

According to the IOC, 11 athletes — eight Russians and three Belarusians — have so far qualified for Paris 2024.

Faeser said Russian teams being excluded and flags and symbols banned was “the absolute minimum we could expect from the International Olympic Committee.”

“It would be completely unacceptable for Ukrainian athletes to have to compete against Russians who support the Russian war of aggression against their country,” she added. “Ukraine — and Ukrainian sport — must continue to enjoy the full support and solidarity of world sport.”

"That partnership will be put to the test this week, as an expected 70,000 people from nearly 200 nations meet amid war, inflation woes and a global energy boom in a Persian Gulf city built by the UAE’s oil wealth. So will a central tenet of Kerry’s climate diplomacy — the notion that the countries, companies and executives who have profited the most from greenhouse gas pollution, those with the power to steer energy markets and the money to kickstart multibillion-dollar disaster funds, should play an essential role in solving the problem.

Embed code:

Trusting an oil mogul to run the talks carries risks — it’s even an “experiment,” as Kerry acknowledged in a recent interview. It began to appear even riskier this week, when leaked documents from al-Jaber’s COP28 team, first reported by the BBC, indicated that the UAE was planning to use the summit to pitch oil and gas deals with more than a dozen countries.

Al-Jaber denounced the report and the other complaints in a fiery appearance Wednesday in Dubai.

“These allegations are false, not true, incorrect, and are not accurate. It is an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency,” he said. “Let me ask you a question — do you think the UAE or myself will need the COP or the COP presidency to go and establish business deals or commercial relationships?”

To the UAE’s critics, the newest allegations confirm their worst fears about allowing al-Jaber to run the negotiations. But if Kerry shares those misgivings, he has not aired them publicly.

Instead, the U.S. has expressed hope that al-Jaber’s influence with his fellow oil and gas producers — historically, one of the major obstacles to climate action — could help win real commitments to cut greenhouse gas pollution. This would be an avenue for progress at a time when Republican opposition at home, anti-green backsliding in Europe and Great Power jockeying with the likes of Russia and China are limiting Biden’s options.

For Kerry, a former U.S. senator and Democratic presidential nominee facing the twilight of his career at age 79, it’s a chance to cement a legacy on reversing the course of climate change — eight years after he landed the Paris Agreement as former President Barack Obama’s secretary of State.

Vindication would come if the summit produces an unambiguous call for the decline of fossil fuels, and concrete plans from big countries and companies to cut net greenhouse gas pollution to zero by the middle of the century. “We find it hard to understand how anybody would continue to allow unabated burning of fossil fuels in the world we’re living in,” Kerry said during a press briefing on Wednesday.

Still, the strategy is proving uncomfortable for some of Kerry’s allies in the climate movement — even those who say they understand the logic. They say the U.S. risks being taken for a ride by fossil fuel producers committed to the status quo, much the way last year’s climate summit in Egypt produced a final text containing language supporting continued use of natural gas.

“John Kerry looks for areas of consensus and areas where the U.S. can push countries that primarily still rely on fossil fuels,” said Anne Christianson, director of international climate policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. “However, I think the cover that was allowed for UAE really hurt us — ‘hurt us’ meaning ‘the world.’”

‘Genuine friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’

Kerry and al-Jaber have met either in person or virtually at least 22 times since Kerry became Biden’s special climate envoy in January 2021, according to POLITICO’s review of public statements, internal documents, media reports and diplomatic schedules.

POLITICO also spoke with 30 current and former U.S. government officials, European negotiators, climate diplomacy veterans and UAE energy executives, who said Kerry and al-Jaber appear to have struck a close partnership amid uniquely complicated and tense negotiations.

Kerry’s ties to the UAE’s government are deep as well. He visited the country during his first travel as Obama’s secretary of State in 2013, a maiden voyage that his chief of staff at the time, David Wade, said carried symbolic significance for the United States.

He endorsed the UAE’s campaign to host the annual climate negotiations as early as June 2021, and was one of the first international figures to applaud al-Jaber’s selection as summit president in January, even as activists’ denunciations swelled.

“I think that Dr. Sultan al-Jaber is a terrific choice,” Kerry told The Associated Press at the time, calling al-Jaber’s leadership of the UAE’s state-owned oil company a selling point. “That company knows it needs to transition.”

The quick, vocal embrace of al-Jaber “was a big deal and enormously stabilizing,” said a person with knowledge of the relationship between the two men, who like other people interviewed for this story was granted anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive diplomacy.

“There is a genuine friendship there and mutual respect,” the person said. “And there’s no question that John Kerry is rooting for Dr. Sultan to be successful. They are in constant communication via text, via staff, calls, via meetings and so forth.”

Both the Biden administration and the climate summit’s organizers dispute the idea that the ties between Kerry and al-Jaber have been unusually close.

“Any suggestion that Secretary Kerry’s discussions with Dr. Sultan and the UAE are disproportionate or any different from his many other interlocutors in the climate space is inaccurate,” said a State Department spokesperson, who insisted on anonymity in keeping with department policies. The person said Kerry has similar relationships with leaders such as Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and former EU climate chief Frans Timmermans.

“One of the assets Secretary Kerry brings to this job are long-term, longtime diplomatic and climate relationships, which are all important and are all deployed on a daily basis,” the spokesperson added. “It would be diplomatic malpractice to do otherwise.”

Al-Jaber has similarly conducted “an unprecedented level of outreach” to other government ministers, the private sector and civil society groups while preparing to lead the summit, a spokesperson for the summit’s UAE-based organizers said in a statement. Those inevitably include Kerry, given the United States’ role as the world’s largest economy and second-largest spewer of greenhouse gases.

“Sensationalizing a single relationship and overlooking the tireless and crucial work of all involved in the COP process undermines this multilateral, multiparty effort,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

Kerry has more generally dismissed idealistic critiques of Biden’s approach to climate diplomacy, such as the U.S. reluctance to pledge hundreds of billions of dollars for developing countries’ climate damages that would never get through a Republican-controlled House. (Kerry has proposed ways of generating this kind of aid from private sources.) “I’m in the zone of reality,” he chided one activist at a policy forum last year.

He also has promoted engagement with the oil and gas industries, as well as the countries that depend on them.

“We have to get the fossil fuel industry at the table,” he told The Financial Times earlier this year. “We have to bring them to this effort and they have to join in by being responsible.”

But climate advocates say they worry that the summit’s organizers are choosing to placate oil and gas producers, including the UAE, by putting them in charge.

“I think it’s time to say, wait a minute, do you take us for fools? Do you think you can just completely remove the disguise and we won’t notice?” Gore said during an August TED talk, in which he cited al-Jaber’s role as evidence that the fossil fuel industry has “brazenly seized control of the COP process.”

When the U.N.’s climate body confirmed the UAE as host of COP28 in November 2021, the oil industry was in the doldrums, giving climate advocates some hope that a window existed for discussing a genuine transition to clean energy. But months later, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spurred a glut of record profits for the industry, which has poured much of that revenue back into new drilling.

Al-Jaber’s Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has joined that trend by announcing a $150 billion, five-year plan whose goals include expanding its oil production capacity. OPEC, the oil-producing cartel to which the UAE belongs, predicts that global oil demand will increase to 116 million barrels per day by 2045, up from 99.6 million today.

Despite those plans, Al-Jaber has called for oil companies to cut their net greenhouse gas pollution to zero by 2050, and has urged his fellow energy executives to take part in addressing rising temperatures, saying: “I know that some of you have felt excluded from the climate dialogue in the past.” He and Kerry have both set slashing methane pollution — a significant source of planet-warming emissions from the oil and gas companies — as a main goal of the summit.

At the same time, al-Jaber has cautioned that “we cannot just unplug from the energy systems of today.”

Al-Jaber’s words overall “have not been backed up by action,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in an interview, though he said he understands why Kerry is supporting him.

“Kerry needs to keep people at the table,” said Markey, a climate advocate who occupies Kerry’s former seat in the Senate. “He is a diplomat and an optimist. And as his friend, I’m serving a role to hold companies accountable for their commitments.”

Kerry is trying to make the most of the opportunity to get such a country on board, said a former senior Biden administration official who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues.

“When you find a petrostate that’s acknowledging what science has acknowledged — that recognizes that they have to diversify, that talks about the need to move the energy transition and wants to play a leadership role — I think his reaction is to embrace that and support that and see how you can continue to move it forward,” the person said.

Still, the ex-official acknowledged, “Everything is a gamble in some ways on this topic.”

Kerry has in recent weeks sounded more caution about the outcome of COP28 with al-Jaber and the UAE at the helm. “It may or may not work,” he told Time magazine earlier this month. “Some might call it an experiment.”

Two oil giants

U.S. support for al-Jaber comes at a time when the Biden administration faces its own criticism from climate activists for approving oil and gas projects, including an oil drilling project in Alaska’s North Slope.

That fact alone dents Kerry’s leverage over the talks, Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley argued in an interview. “We’re going to COP with no influence in the world because we are setting the example of accelerating our production of fossils,” he said.

The U.S. also produces more oil and natural gas than any other country, belying the climate-friendly image it wants to portray on the global stage — and giving it some interests in common with the UAE, the world’s seventh-largest oil and gas producer.

The two major fossil fuel producers also share common ideas about transitioning away from fossil fuels, such as touting carbon capture technology that could allow countries to keep burning oil and gas while blocking their planet-heating pollution from hitting the atmosphere. In contrast, environmental activists and many climate scientists say nations must turn away from fossil fuels entirely, a view that has drawn support from some European capitals.

“The U.S. has much more interests aligned with the Emirates than we do,” said a senior European diplomat, who was granted anonymity in return for candor about the sensitive diplomacy.

For the UAE, the climate negotiations are a coming-out party, the most prominent in a procession of conferences it has hosted as it seeks to act as a bridge to East and West, North and South. The country has rifled through public relations firms to burnish its image for a Western audience.

Al-Jaber and the companies he oversees have banked on his relationship with Kerry to win over skeptics of the UAE’s climate credentials, according to internal documents obtained by POLITICO.

Masdar, a state-owned renewable energy company that al-Jaber founded, identified Kerry as an example of the “stakeholders and third-party allies who can externally validate” its ambition to become “one of the world’s largest clean energy companies,” according to an October 2022 planning document that has not previously been reported. Similarly, the national oil company that al-Jaber leads sought out Kerry to “validate ADNOC’s role as a responsible energy provider in the context of a pro-growth, pro-climate energy transition,” according to a December strategy document that POLITICO reported on early this month.

Masdar and ADNOC didn’t respond to questions about their focus on Kerry. But ADNOC previously dismissed the strategy document as outdated and “unreliable.”

When Kerry traveled to last year’s U.N. climate talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, he flew on a plane chartered by Masdar, according to a previously unreported LinkedIn post by a former Masdar official that includes a photo of the U.S. envoy sitting in business class.

The State Department confirmed that Kerry was on the flight and said the U.S. paid for his seat on the plane. The department spokesperson said Kerry needed to travel on short notice from a regional forum in Abu Dhabi for a meeting with Chinese officials, and no commercial flights would have gotten him there in time.

This year’s talks come at a complicated period in geopolitics. The UAE recently was invited to join the informal group of emerging economies known as BRICS, bringing it closer to U.S. competitors Russia and China. Since Western sanctions crashed down on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, Russian money has flooded into the UAE — Russians are now the biggest international real estate investors in the Emirates.

The UAE has also invested considerably in Africa. It is a security bulwark against Iran, which has taken on even greater importance amid clashes between Hamas and Israel. It has deep, complicated relations with Saudi Arabia, the global oil powerhouse that has posed a longtime obstacle to swift climate action.

The summit offers a chance for Kerry to keep the UAE within the United States’ orbit, at least on climate.

Those efforts could prove consequential for some of the top items at the negotiations. The U.S. is trying to steer the course of a promised international fund that would compensate developing nations for climate damage, in part by insisting that countries like China should pay into it. Kerry has also called on the UAE and other wealthy Gulf states, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to contribute more money to fighting climate change.

Some of that U.S. pressure may be bearing fruit. POLITICO reported in August that the UAE is considering creating a fund holding tens of billions of dollars to spur clean energy investments around the world. The UAE’s sovereign wealth funds would contribute to the program, representing one of the largest-ever climate finance contributions.

Kerry has also poured diplomatic energy into one of the summit’s biggest tasks — tallying up how much nations have done to curb warming since signing the Paris agreement in 2015, and how far they must still go. That decision will set a direction for the next round of national climate pledges, which are due in 2025.

And he wants a strong declaration at the end of COP about how much more countries need to do to combat global warming, a senior State Department official said in a recent call with reporters. Keeping the UAE in line with that position and away from nations like Saudi Arabia, Russia or China is key to accomplishing that.

For the U.S. to consider the summit a success, the final deal will need to not only commit to curtailing the use of fossil fuels, but to chart a way for that to happen.

Kerry, Markey said, “is doing everything in his power to corral a deal which will work for the planet.”

[Pilot] Attention, passengers.

Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelt.

[Narrator] You know what that likely means, turbulence.

And if you've been getting on a plane recently,

it feels like turbulence has been getting a lot worse.

[passengers screaming]

So what does this mean for the future of travel?

In a few decades time looks a lot more turbulent

with hundreds of percent more severe clear air turbulence

in those skies.

[Narrator] And how are pilots reacting

to more and more rough air?

So we slow down just a little bit

to reach that maneuvering air speed,

so that it doesn't get bounced around as much.

[gentle music]

[Narrator] First, we need to understand

just exactly what turbulence is.

Turbulence is a chaotic random motion

that occurs in all fluids.

It's around us all the time.

It's in your bathtub, it's in your cup of coffee,

and of course it's in the atmosphere.

[Narrator] There are a bunch

of different types of turbulence,

but in particular we're going to talk about CAT.

[cat meowing]

No, not that kind of cat, but Clear Air Turbulence.

CAT is the particular type of turbulence

that is getting worse because of climate change.

And since it involves clear air in the jet streams,

it cannot be detected by radar before a plane is in it.

Clear air turbulence is generated

by wind shear in the jet stream.

Anyone who's ever climbed a tall building,

for example, the Eiffel Tower, very calm at the bottom,

but the higher up you go, the windier it gets,

and that increase in wind speed with heights

is what's called wind shear.

When the wind shear is too strong,

the atmosphere simply can't contain that

and it breaks down into turbulence as a result.

[Narrator] There are different levels of turbulence.

You have light, moderate, severe, and extreme.

Severe turbulence is turbulence

in which the up and downward motions of the aircraft

will experience vertical accelerations that exceed 1G.

Around 5,000 aircraft annually encounter severe turbulence

in the US causing hundreds of injuries

to passengers and flight attendants.

This severe injury causing turbulence is rare,

but of course, multiply that by all the planes

that are in the skies at any given moment

and one of them will encounter that severe turbulence.

[Narrator] For pilots,

turbulence is about maintaining passenger comfort

and trying to figure out where turbulence

could potentially be and then circumnavigating it.

So the forces on an aircraft

are lift, weight, thrust, and drag,

and air is a fluid, it's keeping it airborne suspended

at in flight at all times,

and turbulence is like a minor disturbance

in the middle of it.

[Narrator] How is climate change making turbulence worse?

What our satellites can see is the three dimensional shape

and structure of the jet stream,

and they've been measuring that for at least four decades.

There's an amplification of the warming

in the tropical parts of the planet,

and that effect is increasing the north to south

temperature difference across the jet stream,

and that's driving stronger wind shear in the jet stream

which is generating more clear air turbulence.

So that's the link from temperatures

to winds shear to turbulence.

[Narrator] This is what turbulence looked like in 1979,

and this is what turbulence looked like in recent years.

We see the same pattern except that the hotspots

are even hotter today.

There's greater likelihood

of encountering clear air turbulence in those hotspots.

50 or 60% more turbulence in some regions.

[Narrator] And this is what turbulence could look like

if global warming continues.

What we are looking at here is supercomputer simulations

of the atmosphere.

Now the simulation on the left is our control simulation,

whereas the simulation on the right

is one in which we've increased the carbon dioxide

to describe what a future real world might look like

with a lot more turbulence in the skies that we fly through.

What we find is that there's a doubling,

or perhaps even a tripling,

of the amount of severe clear air turbulence

in the atmosphere.

So the future in a few decades time

looks a lot more turbulent with hundreds of percent

more severe clear air turbulence in those skies.

[Narrator] And where will those hotspots particularly be?

There's 55% more severe turbulence over the North Atlantic

than there was in the 1970s.

41% more over the US and similar figures around the world.

That's the the definitive evidence really

that clear air turbulence

has already started to get stronger.

[Narrator] So what does this mean for air travel,

in particular over areas like North America

and the North Atlantic?

We're certainly projecting a doubling or a tripling

in the amount of turbulence in a few decades time,

but that will just mean that we go

from 0.1% of the atmosphere having severe turbulence in it

to 0.2 or 0.3%,

and that's certainly not going to mean we're gonna have

to shut down parts of air space

and say there's too much turbulence.

I don't think that's on the cards really.

It's just a case of turbulence becoming more frequent,

and pilots needing to keep even closer tabs

than they already do on where the turbulence is

and trying to avoid it as best as they can.

[Narrator] For pilots, this means relying on programs

like WSI Pilotbrief and SkyPath to plan out flight routes.

[Andrea] You're looking at a god's eye view

of our route of flight.

The various hazards along the way

are those big green circles and then the red boxes.

If you look at the bottom half of the screen,

that's a vertical profile.

You'll see that toward the end,

if it stayed at 33,000 feet it would encounter

that big yellow and orange section of turbulence.

And that's why in this case,

this aircraft has chosen to climb all the way up

to 39,000 feet to try to avoid it.

[Narrator] Pilots also use SkyPath,

which crowdsource turbulence data from other flights.

[Machine] Caution turbulence detected.

[Andrea] The yellow dots means they're encountering

light turbulence along the way.

And you can see that if you hover over any individual dot

like that orange dot there, it'll show you

you're gonna encounter moderate turbulence

at flight level 400 or 40,000 feet.

[Narrator] With this information in mind,

pilots can decide to circumnavigate turbulence,

for example, by adjusting altitude.

Clear air turbulence caused by jet streams

tends to be due to a very narrow band of air

that's moving very rapidly.

That narrow band of air

may only only be 2000, 3,000 feet thick,

and if that's the case, then you can just climb

or descend a couple thousand feet

and be out of it right away.

So when we encounter clear air turbulence

the very first thing we'll do,

of course, is turn the seatbelt sign on,

make sure we call back to the flight attendants,

and make sure they're either seated if it's bad enough,

or that they're checking the passengers are seated

if it's not bad enough.

We'll talk to air traffic control right away.

We'll figure out what the planes ahead of us are seeing

and if they're doing any better at any other altitude,

so we can climb or descend immediately.

[Narrator] And for pilots, this also means going as fast

as safely possible to get through turbulence.

Most of the time when we're flying

through clear air turbulence,

we're gonna keep the auto flight systems on.

Oftentimes, the auto throttles though in severe turbulence

are recommended to be turned off.

And the reason why is because those thrust levers

will be chasing around airspeeds pretty rapidly

and it's not necessarily good for the engines.

It's better just to leave them in one steady place

and hope that the airspeed is not chasing itself.

[Narrator] When pilots are in turbulence,

they tend to go out maneuvering air speed.

What that is, is the fastest speed that you can fly,

have full deflection of your control surfaces,

and not structurally damage the aircraft.

So we slow down just a little bit

to reach that maneuvering air speed

so that it doesn't get bounced around as much

and that we can go through at the quickest we can

without bouncing around the passengers too much.

The airlines are constantly changing

to adapt to our dynamic and changing air travel environment.

So if climate conditions make turbulence worse,

then we will continue to evolve

and make sure that turbulence procedures

are reflected in that, even if that means

different procedures to avoid it in the first place.

I specialize in turbulence.

I study it every day, I have done for 20 years.

But even for me, when I fly through turbulence

I feel that energy in my stomach, my heart racing.

It just plugs into a very primitive part of our brains

that logic can't override.

And I tell myself, I understand.

You know, this is why I study.

I'm perfectly safe.

It doesn't help.

A tip I heard recently is to order a drink

and just put the drink in front of you

and watch how still the water surface is in turbulence

because the emotions are a lot less severe than you think.",technology

"“It is practically a miracle that this is even possible,” said Dr. Stephan Grupp, chief of the cellular therapy and transplant section at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Grupp, who consults for Vertex, said his medical center was hoping to begin treating sickle cell patients next year.

But, he added, “I am very realistic about how hard this is.”

The obstacles to treatment are myriad: an extremely limited number of medical centers authorized to provide it; the requirement that each patient’s cells be edited or have a gene added individually; procedures that are so onerous that not everyone can tolerate them; and a multimillion-dollar price tag and potential insurance obstacles.

As a result, sickle cell experts said, only a small fraction of patients in the United States are expected to receive the new treatment (to say nothing of the millions of sickle cell patients overseas, particularly in Africa, for whom it may be completely out of reach for now). The F.DA. estimates that about 20,000 patients — who are 12 and older and have had episodes of debilitating pain — will be eligible for the therapies.

The gene editing treatment, called Exa-cel and using the brand name Casgevy, was jointly developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Boston and CRISPR Therapeutics of Switzerland. It uses CRISPR, the Nobel Prize-winning gene editing tool, to snip patients’ DNA. For a small number of subjects in clinical trials, it corrected the effects of the mutation, which results in red blood cells that are shaped like sickles or crescents that become caught in blood vessels, blocking them.

Casgevy is the first treatment to be approved that uses CRISPR. Patients will also need expensive, intensive medical care and a long hospitalization.",technology

"The big hope is that Tusk can help realign Warsaw back with the EU mainstream again, robbing Hungary's Victor Orbán of a key ally in his own attempts to undermine the EU's core strategic priorities | Wojtek Radwanski/AFP via Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

BRUSSELS — Welcome back, Donald Tusk!

In all likelihood, it will be a very familiar, newly anointed Polish prime minister, who will return to his old office building at the European Council in Brussels next week, for what is set to be a bruising summit of EU leaders.

For many Europeans, Tusk’s return to the EU’s top table promises to bring back the good old days before 2015, when Poland’s nationalist, conservative administration under the Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power and spent eight years throwing spanners into the EU’s machinery.

But the new Tusk could be quite different from the old one. Rather than ruling a confident country coming into its own as a fast-rising European power, he’ll be nursing a deeply divided nation after eight years of populist rule that turned Poland into the bad boy of European politics.

There’s palpable nostalgia for Tusk’s previous premiership — from 2007 to 2014 — when France, Germany and Poland could often club together to act as a powerful engine to drive EU business forward. It was a catalyzing trio known as the “Weimar Triangle,” a grouping created in 1991 which flourished to such an extent under Tusk that he became a sure-fire candidate to take over as European Council president from 2014 to 2019.

In a major turn-around in Europe’s political landscape, PiS failed to win a third term in office and lost Poland’s October 15 general election — a victory that gave hope across the Continent that populist parties can be defeated. Tusk looks set to be sworn in as Prime Minister by President Andrzej Duda on December 13.

“Collectively, we are underreporting the importance of the change of government in Poland,” a senior EU official said, who like others in this story, was granted anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. “That strategically changes the balance of the European Council, because you’ll probably have a more constructive government. And that is a game changer in my mind.”

A French diplomat added: “Tusk sent a very clear message … we are back.”

But those high hopes may soon run hard into Poland’s domestic reality, where Tusk will often have limited room for maneuver.

He will both have to manage a coalition of four diverse parties ranging from socialists to big-city free-market liberals and socially conservative agrarians, and will run into fierce opposition from a furious PiS. Duda, a PiS loyalist, will still have a significant ability to thwart Tusk’s political goals thanks to his veto powers.

Rather than leading in Brussels, much of his time and energy will be spent in Warsaw trying to rebuild a shattered justice system, purging the government, media and state corporations of PiS loyalists and shepherding commissions aimed at uncovering wrongdoing by the outgoing administration.

Hopes for a reboot

One of the gravest problems for Brussels while PiS was running Poland was that one of the bloc’s most important countries posed continual problems on rule of law issues ranging from judicial independence to media freedoms and LGBTQ+ rights.

The big hope is that Tusk can help realign Warsaw back with the EU mainstream again, robbing Hungary’s Victor Orbán of a key ally in his own attempts to undermine the EU’s core strategic priorities.

But there is more at stake for Brussels. The EU is laying the ground for a historic enlargement process, opening the door for several future member countries, of which Ukraine would be both the largest and the most consequential.

It’s key to ensure Poland is on board with that process — but that won’t necessarily be plain sailing. While Poland has a profound historical sympathy for Ukraine’s battle with Russia, has welcomed millions of refugees, and supplied arms and ammunition, the country is also the frontline of why it will prove so difficult to integrate Kyiv into the single market. Polish farmers and truck drivers have reacted with outrage to what they see as Ukrainians undercutting their businesses.

Tusk’s experience as European Council president has raised hopes he will be able to navigate these challenges and pull off a reboot, putting Warsaw back into synch with Paris and Berlin.

“He knows how the machine works, he knows a lot of the people, it’s like welcoming an old friend,” said one EU official.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hosted Tusk, who hails from the same center-right European People’s Party, shortly after October’s Polish election, with a joint formal press point, even though Tusk was far from being appointed as the new government leader.

“It was as if he was already prime minister,” an EU diplomat reflected on the meeting, stressing that others had been celebrating Tusk’s comeback in more discreet ways.

A senior French diplomat said the upcoming “extremely pro-European” government provides opportunities for new cooperation, both bilaterally and within the Weimar format.

A Tusk government is also expected to soothe Polish-German relations after anti-German sentiment fueled PiS’s election campaign, including demands for war reparations, Nazi allusions and regular accusations that Tusk was a “German agent.”

“The relationship with Germany will improve because it was so bad that it’s difficult not to improve,” said Piotr Buras of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

But that doesn’t automatically mean a successful Weimar Triangle, Buras stressed, as a good Franco-German relations are precondition for that.

“Adding Poland to that discussion won’t make things easier,” he said. “To be honest, the expectations about the Weimar Triangle have always been overblown.”

Another EU official also said that as long as the German internal coalition problems impede the Franco-German engine from firing up, any talk of adding Poland is bound to be hype. It’s too much to ask Tusk to heal Franco-German rifts.

“Sure, Tusk can bring in a positive dynamic but more by avoiding Polish ‘no’s.’ But not as a lubricant between France and Germany,” the official said.

Not so fast

Polish domestic politics may also trigger a quick end of the honeymoon between Brussels and Warsaw.

The most pressing issue is when, whether and how Poland will be able to access its €35 billion in EU grants and loans for recovering from the coronavirus pandemic as well as €76.5 billion of regular EU development money — frozen by Brussels over Poland’s backsliding on rule of law. Tusk had campaigned on a platform of getting EU funds flowing again.

Polish media reported earlier this week that Tusk will try to leverage his former position in the EU to bid the Commission to release €6.9 billion from the bloc’s pandemic recovery fund as soon as he officially takes over, even without Poland formally meeting any of the so-called milestones yet.

Still, Poland will eventually have to meet those rule-of-law conditions to unlock the rest of the cash.

While Tusk pledged he’d do exactly that immediately after taking office, he is still going to face a rough ride from Duda or the country’s Constitutional Tribunal, controlled by PiS loyalists. Any legislation to undo judicial system reforms has to go through Duda, who can either veto it or ask the tribunal to review it.

The first French diplomat said Paris will closely track the new Polish coalition agreement. “He had to radicalize his positions [during the campaign], so we don’t think we are in paradise yet.”

Indeed, in the campaign before the October election, Tusk adopted similar rhetoric to PiS, especially on migration from Muslim countries.

Just because Tusk is again ruling in Warsaw won’t turn Poland into a cuddly partner for the rest of the EU. There were frictions over issues like coal, farming and Russia when he was premier before, and many of those issues haven’t changed.

Poland is still among the fiercest military backers of Ukraine in the EU, will be slower than other countries to go green on energy, is a very close ally of the U.S. with commitments to buy vast amounts of American and South Korean weapons, and is in thrall to a politically powerful farming sector.

Tusk is also cool on efforts to spur EU integration.

“Among other things, that’s why I sought victory in these elections, so that Poland would again influence the decisions of Europe, and not the other way around. We are the ones who will decide what the directions of change in the European Union will be,” he said last week in the Polish parliament.

“Many in Europe will probably be surprised by the amount of continuity,” said Buras. “Rhetoric and style will be completely different. That also matters. But when it comes to substance, defending Polish national interests … it won’t be so different in many files.”

Tusk may not even be able to count on much breathing room after he takes over, as Poland is about to enter two years of nearly permanent campaigning, with local elections due in April, followed by the European election in June and, finally, a presidential election in 2025.

Hey, I'm Olivia Rodrigo

and this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.

[upbeat music]

Hehehe, okay.

I'm scared.

[upbeat music]

All right.

When did Olivia Rodrigo become famous?

I was acting on shows when I was younger.

I was very fortunate to be

in a few Disney shows and that was so much fun.

And then I put out drivers license when I was 17

and sort of changed my world forever.

So, maybe I'd say drivers license.

Simultaneously, everything changed in my life

and nothing changed at all.

Feel the same,

I hang out with the same people,

I still have the same insecurities and fears.

I feel like I'm good at the same things.

It's just my environment just changed completely

in such a short amount of time, which is kind of crazy.

Looking back on it, I'm like, wow, what a wild time.

When did Olivia Rodrigo get her driver's license?

I got my driver's license a little late.

I think I was 17.

All my friends were getting their driver's license,

driving around.

I would literally go to bed

like thinking about it, dreaming about it.

And I booked an appointment to go to the DMV to take my test

and I take my mom's car and I pull up

and the test proctor or whatever is in the other seat

and he's like, okay, like left, right, stop.

Blinker works, okay.

Brake lights work, great.

And he goes, honk the horn.

And I try to honk the horn and nothing comes out.

And I'm like, what?

Like that's so weird.

And he's like, well, try again.

I keep trying and I keep trying

and the horn doesn't work on my mom's car for some reason.

And they say, oh, you're unfit.

Like you can't take the test.

Your car's unsafe.

And I cry like a baby in the parking lot.

I was so distraught.

But then the second time that I took the test,

I got a song out of it, too.

So I'd say that it was probably meant to be.

Why does Olivia Rodrigo make sad songs?

Because it's fun.

People like to listen to sad songs.

I love listening to sad songs, even when I'm happy.

And they're really fun to write.

When I'm really low

and I listen to a sad song that I absolutely love

that captures that feeling really succinctly,

it just helps you understand your feeling so much more.

And that's just in and of itself so powerful.

I love sad songs.

I'll love them forever.

Who is Olivia's songs about?

Your mom.

All right.

Can Olivia Rodrigo parallel park?

Guys, I wrote a song

and I said I can't parallel park in the song.

I was 18 then.

I'm 20 now and I actually think that I am quite passable.

I did it the other day on a crowded busy street

where there were people behind me,

really putting pressure on me,

and I was so proud of myself

and my friend was in the passenger seat to witness.

So, one of my crowning achievements.

Is Olivia Rodrigo favorite color purple?

Yes, my favorite color is purple.

I like it.

It's the color of magic and all things mystic.

Is Olivia Rodrigo friends with Jenna Ortega?

Yes, I am.

Jenna and I grew up together on the Disney Channel

which is a very strange way to grow up,

but I've always thought she was the coolest

and so happy for her and all of her success.

I truly don't know anyone more kind or deserving.

Is Olivia Rodrigo a good singer?

I hope so, God.

I'm no Mariah Carey or anything,

but I like to think that I convey some emotion in my voice

and that's what counts.

Hope so.

How does Olivia Rodrigo

write songs?

I'm a very lyric based songwriter.

I love looking at songs

as if they're just like pieces of poetry.

So lots of times inspiration for my songs will come across,

someone will be saying something interesting

in a conversation, I'll be like,

wow, that's cool, that's catchy,

or that rhymes, like, let me write that down.

Every time it's different.

Sometimes I'll come up with chords

or melody that I like and finish it from there.

It's what's fun about it.

You never know,

you never know how it's gonna happen.

How old was Olivia Rodrigo in high school?

In high school, oh, I was like, um, high school age?

High School Musical.

That makes way more sense.

Must've been 15.

How to draw Olivia Rodrigo easy?

I'm not the person to ask here.

I'll give you a template.

I think I have like sort of heart shaped face.

I could be wrong.

Oh, God.

Think I have like almondy eyes.

This is just already super bad.

Okay, this is gonna be more of a Picasso.

[Olivia giggling]

Oh God, that looks awful.

I tried to draw me sticking my tongue out to try to like

remake the Sour cover so that it was clear it was me,

but it looks terrible.

I write songs, I don't draw.

I tried.

All right.

What is Olivia Rodrigo's genre?

I'd like to think that I make pop music that is adventurous.

I love rock music and folk music

and singer songwriter music, obviously.

There's a little bit of sprinkles of that in there.

What song did Olivia Rodrigo change the lyrics to?

Changed the lyrics to a lot of songs.

I suppose on Sour, it was very angsty

and so lots of the songs on Sour

didn't really change too much

from the sort of original inception of the idea.

But I guess on this album I did a lot more polishing.

So every song always changing.

What is Olivia Rodrigo's most streamed song?

drivers license and good 4 u?

It's good 4 u?

Wow, that's cool.

Thanks, guys.

Good for you.

I think I was rightfully really nervous

that I was gonna be one hit wonder.

Nothing wrong with being a one hit wonder.

I was so happy to have that one hit when I had it,

but it was really cool to see that good 4 u

in some regards better than drivers license.

That was really cool.

Grateful for everyone who's streamed those songs.

Thank you so much.

What is Olivia Rodrigo vampire about?

Olivia Rodrigo vampire is about me

because all of my songs are about me

and they're introspective and they're about nothing else.

Okay.

Will Olivia Rodrigo do a GUTS tour?

Yes, I will.

I'm very excited.

Come see me.

It would be a lot of fun.

I'm so excited for this tour.

I think it's going to be a ball.

Does Olivia Rodrigo have a tattoo?

It's debatable.

I got a matching tattoo with my best friend, Iris.

We got hearts on our pinkies and I don't know

if you can tell, mine is completely worn off.

It doesn't look like a heart at all.

It looks like I like smudged sharpie

on my hand or something like that.

So technically, there is some tattoo ink,

but I don't know if I'd really classify it as a tattoo.

I think my next tattoo, I'm gonna wait

till I have kids and then I'll get their names

tattooed on me or something like that.

That's the plan.

Does Olivia Rodrigo say I love you in deja vu?

I do say I love you in deja vu.

If you listen very closely, I go

love you in between the chorus and the verse

and then I go I love you

because it's in between the chorus and the verse.

But you have to turn it up really loud to hear it.

Little secret from me to you.

Okay, Olivia Rodrigo album cover.

Yeah, I mean I have two albums.

They both have purple album covers.

This latest one has some rings that

say guts on them because I love four letter words,

all types of four letter words.

And hope you like it, yeah.

Olivia Rodrigo college.

I took a poetry class, so that was really fun.

And we actually turned one of the songs that I wrote

in the poetry class, the poem's called lacy.

We turned it into a song on the album called lacy.

So, it was quite fruitful.

Olivia Rodrigo Jack White.

He's great.

He's one of my heroes.

So, go Jack White.

I think The White Stripes are so perfectly simple

and so grungy and imperfect

in the most beautiful, intentional way.

And he just like writes the catchiest riffs and hooks

and I don't know how he does it.

It's like other worldly.

Olivia Rodrigo quotes from songs.

I don't know, there's kind of a lot to choose from.

I see brutal lyrics a lot.

People tell me that it's brutal out here a lot.

Mm, good 4 u.

Every time I meet a new person,

they're like, oh 'good 4 u.'

And I'm like, yeah, that's me.

So, maybe that.

Okay, Olivia Rodrigo's zodiac sign.

I'm a Pisces through and through, baby.

Pisces are like super emotional, super musical.

They like water, usually and I love water.

If I'm ever stressed out,

I'll like jump in a pool or the ocean

or even going in the shower and I'm just reborn.

I dunno.

Cool.

Okay, what is Olivia Rodrigo's new album called?

My album is called GUTS.

I came up with a name many years ago.

I wrote a song that is not very good

and will never see the light of day called Hate Your Guts

and I always thought that was a really interesting phrase.

And I also love that guts can mean bravery.

Trusting your gut means intuition.

You know, spilling your guts is

telling everyone your dirty little secrets.

So, a very loaded word and I like it.

What is Olivia Rodrigo's nickname?

Lots of people call me Liv.

Some people call me Livy.

My mom calls me Livy Loubelle.

My grandpa calls me Oli.

You know, not terribly unusual.

What's Olivia Rodrigo's aesthetic?

God, you know, some days I really don't know.

I really love nineties sort of grungy things.

PJ Harvey's style.

I love Alexa Chung's style.

TBD on that one.

I feel like I'm ever changing, ever evolving.

What is Olivia Rodrigo's daily routine?

Lately, I've been waking up every day,

I've been making a matcha, and eating two Brazil nuts

'cause I saw some TikTok that said

that it's good for your hormones or something,

which is probably like, a complete lie.

But I try to write every day.

Every day is different.

So, I always start that off with my matcha

and my two Brazil nuts.

What

shampoo

does Olivia Rodrigo

use?

It's called Good Hair Day.

Someone gave it to me once and I just went with it.

Rollin' with it.

Those are all the boards.

So glad I could clear the air on what type of shampoo I use.

I know you guys were dying to know.

Burning question.

Now I feel like I need to go learn how to draw.

Thank you so much for watching.

"One of the things that differentiated the Breitmans from many others in the money-­creation game was they never believed, as a meme once had it, that Bitcoin works “because math.” Of course, Arthur thought, if you could depend only on math, that would be fantastic, but that was impossible; you invariably had to rely on people, and thus the kinds of leverage afforded by institutions. And there were, after all, plenty of credible people and credible institutions that had underscored thousands of years of humanity’s joint efforts. Among the most auspicious of those joint efforts was the proliferation of money as a coordinating technology.

The blockchain could only properly be understood as a product of that history. Human commerce had seen lots of different kinds of money in circulation—money that was a good store of value but a bad means of exchange (like gold); money that was a good means of exchange but a bad store of value (like cacao beans); money that was a good means of exchange and a good store of value but a bad unit of account (like the early years of the euro)—but there weren’t many good examples of money that could be reengineered midflight according to the preferences of the community. Entire social movements have arisen to protest the inflexibility of currency. A hard fork last year in the Bitcoin community was one example; another, memorialized in The Wizard of Oz, was a campaign for monetary expansion that gave rise to major American populist unrest. Tezos described its future tokens as programmable money that its bearers could hold to account.

The Tezos Foundation took in $232 million in alchemical exchange for a currency that did not exist, and according to the fine print, might never.

Deli Dollars, for example, could be put onto Tezos. Everybody who bought a Deli Dollar would get to vote on how they would behave. They could decide, say, that if you help Frank sweep the floors for an hour, your account is credited with five Deli Dollars. Or that if you propose an imaginative new sandwich, Frank will put it on the menu, and you’ll get 2 percent of the proceeds in the form of Deli Dollars. All of the accounting and the settlements would be automated and incorruptible, so there would be no question as to whether the books were kosher. If people rushed to sweep Frank’s floors and invent his sandwiches, then there might be too many Deli Dollars in circulation; the lines would extend around the block, and Frank might be forced to radically increase the price of a sandwich. But the platform itself could then automatically adjust both Deli Dollar “wages” and sandwich prices to allow for nominal inflation. That is: Relative to the total number of Deli Dollars in circulation, the price of the sandwich could stay the same. If this sounds like some hippie collective, or a hyperlocal Federal Reserve, that’s because it is. The Breitmans believed that the blockchain didn’t have to replace the kind of trust inspired by Frank; it could actually underwrite and extend it.

Tezos was designed at least in part for enterprises like Frank’s that might want to operate on a larger scale, or for larger entities that might seek to generate public credibility by outsourcing their accounting to a clear, auditable blockchain. Imagine, for example, a video­game that runs an internal economy on a credit like digital gold; Tezos could prevent arbitrary changes to the game’s money supply. Or take the example of airline miles, a form of private currency that is constantly debased by its issuers. It makes little sense to commit to an airline’s loyalty program if one year a domestic flight is 35,000 miles and the next year it’s 70,000. If these companies decided to put their rules and conditions into smart contracts on a public blockchain, the miles might be understood to be a better store of value, and loyalty programs would become more attractive.",technology

Steph, thank you so much for being here.

We are missing you in person at LiveWIRED,

but we are so grateful

that you could make the time to talk to us

in the middle of what I am sure is a very busy NBA season.

Even though you can't be here in person,

we're excited to talk to your executive team

a little bit later, but let me first start by asking you,

what was the genesis for Thirty Ink?

What made you want to move forward with this endeavor?

Oh, I appreciate you having me and my team.

I think this is a great opportunity to kinda share

what, you know, Thirty Ink is

in respect to understanding the platform

and the reach that basketball

and just all the different opportunities

that have come my way over the last 15 years,

really since I've been in the league,

and the doors that it's opened,

to have kind of a collective mindset around

how I could leverage that impact and influence

in a positive direction to create opportunity

across different business ventures and entities.

But in a way, using all of those to help

what we call elevate the under, and the underrated,

underrepresented, underestimated,

across, you know, different interests,

being able to, you know, create a,

at that inflection point of where, you know,

purpose and profit really, really align.

And I think for us, it's been an amazing journey

to really create a hyperfocus around the ways

that I know I can move the needle

and create, you know, lasting impact.

So you've always said social responsibility

is closely tied to your mission as an athlete

and an entrepreneur.

Why, talk to me a little bit about the

underrated aspect of this again.

Why is that so important to you?

I think it just stems from how I was raised

and the idea that understanding how blessed I am

to be able to do what I get to do for a living

and the, you know, the spotlight that you're under

and knowing if you, you know, you say something,

you show up somewhere, you do something,

it does move the needle.

And I think for me there's always a perspective of,

you know, it's not just that title

of being able to give back,

but it's a way of thinking outside of yourself

on how can I galvanize collective change

in these different interests that, for me, whether it's,

you know, in the golf space, in the lifestyle space,

in the media space, how I kind of take my learning lessons

and give it to the next generation of athletes

that are coming up, for them to find their own voice.

I think that for me has always been a way to,

my dad always used to tell me, you gotta leave the game

in a better place than you found it.

And I'm trying to do that in basketball,

but also trying to do that off the court.

And that's the way of, you know, making that a priority.

I'm gonna grill you on this a little bit.

You're talking about having an impact,

but where might that focus be?

Is this about impacting policy,

building community, philanthropy?

What are the specifics, Steph?

It's across all of those.

I think it's creating meaningful opportunity

amongst the underrepresented

and especially from a diversity perspective.

I know that's a hot topic

across, you know, all different sectors,

but we have a certain discipline around

how we hold our brand partners, our investment partners,

anybody that's related to Thirty Ink

in terms of holding them accountable to, you know,

you know, creating access and opportunity and equity.

And if it comes down to policy,

we do a lot of that stuff with our foundation,

with Eat.Learn.Play,

when it comes to just the ability to walk into a room

and see that reflect, you know, what the world looks like

and create opportunity for people to

do meaningful work and be connected to us.

I think holding everybody accountable to that.

And that's something that when you show up on a set,

when you show up in a meeting,

that's what the room should reflect.

It should reflect the world.

Well, that's great. My last question.

In the NBA you don't really get to pick your teammates,

but with Thirty Ink you're recruiting

for a entirely different skillset.

Who's helping you in this endeavor?

Yeah, they, the one thing about my success, I guess,

on the court is, you know, I've had some amazing teammates

and we've all lifted and elevated each other.

And to your point, you know,

you're only as good as your team

and the leadership that you have.

And so I've been blessed to have gone through that process

to find, you know, my all-star team

and the the ones that, you know,

while I'm out there on the court,

you know, trying to put the ball in the basket

for as long as I can,

I'm right there in lockstep with these four individuals

who will be on the stage with you,

you know, speaking in a minute.

And that includes Suresh Singh

who's the chairman and secretary of Thirty Ink.

Tiffany Williams, who's the COO of Thirty Ink.

Chris Helfrich, who is the CEO of Eat.Learn.Play,

our foundation.

Eric Peyton, who's the co-founder, co-CEO

and Chief Creative Officer of Unanimous Media.

So they are the representation of a great team

that I've been able to put together

to represent everything that I am about in business

and I can't wait for you guys to hear from them.

Well great. We're super excited

to welcome them to the stage.

We're sorry you can't be here,

but thank you so much for joining us, Steph.

And I appreciate you having me.",technology
"So let’s set the record straight.

The opening to China was not Kissinger’s initiative.

The driving force behind the decision to reestablish diplomatic relations with Beijing wasn’t Kissinger; it was President Richard Nixon. In fact, Kissinger was at first astonished by the idea and even snide about it. Alexander Haig, who was Kissinger’s deputy in 1969, recorded in his own memoir how, a few weeks after Nixon took office, Kissinger emerged from a meeting with Nixon and told him, “Our Leader has taken leave of reality. He thinks this is the moment to establish normal relations with Communist China. He has just ordered me to make this flight of fancy come true.” In Haig’s description, Kissinger then grasped his head in his hands and said in astonishment, “China!”

It became Kissinger’s role to carry out Nixon’s initiative, which he proceeded to do, often skillfully but also often mendaciously. But it wasn’t his idea, and it took a bit of time before he embraced it.

Kissinger lied about the most fundamental, consequential aspect of his secret trip to China.

The lie was about Taiwan. For decades, the principal source of information about what happened on Kissinger’s secret trip to Beijing in 1971 was Kissinger’s own account in his memoirs. In it, he wrote that Taiwan “was only mentioned briefly” during his first, groundbreaking meeting with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai.

In 2002, the record of that Kissinger encounter with Zhou was declassified and released. It showed that, contrary to “barely mentioned,” the subject of Taiwan had taken up roughly the first third of the meeting. What’s more, Kissinger made crucial concessions during that discussion that have governed and constrained American policy toward China and Taiwan from then until the present day. Before Kissinger’s trip, the official position of the United States was that sovereignty over Taiwan was “an unsettled question.” But Kissinger promised Zhou that the United States would not support two Chinese governments (one in Beijing, one in Taipei); that it would also not agree to a solution of “one China, one Taiwan”; and, finally, that it would not support an independent Taiwan.

Were these concessions ones that had to be made for the opening to China to proceed? That’s not clear, and some people think not. Remember that America’s opening to China was also China’s opening to the United States — that at the time, China, desperately poor and in an increasingly militarized conflict with the Soviet Union, eagerly wanted a new relationship with the United States. So in retrospect, it’s not clear that Kissinger needed to have made such a significant concession so early in the discussions.

The late Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, a highly respected Georgetown University historian, examined the opening to China in a scholarly article and concluded: “Nixon and Kissinger wanted so intensely to realize their goal that they surrendered more than was necessary to achieve, and the price was paid, not in the near term by the Nixon White House, but over the long term by the people of Taiwan and by U.S. diplomacy writ large.” Tucker concluded that “the president and his national security advisor viewed Taiwan as dispensable.”

Kissinger left out the parts of his China diplomacy that failed.

The declassified records show that there were aspects of Kissinger’s China diplomacy that were either unsuccessful or downright embarrassing and thus not disclosed. In 1995, after a five-year battle, the Los Angeles Times (where I worked at the time) won a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain a secret, previously classified study by the U.S. intelligence community of early American negotiations with China. The study showed that Nixon and Kissinger wanted help from China in resolving the Vietnam War, help that they never got. In early 1972, they asked Beijing to bring North Vietnam’s peace negotiator Le Duc Tho to China for talks on Chinese soil in the middle of Nixon’s historic trip. China rebuffed the overture.

In the category of simply embarrassing behavior, the secret U.S. intelligence study quoted Kissinger as exclaiming at one point during the Nixon visit in 1972, “After a dinner of Peking duck, I’ll agree to anything.” Yet Kissinger became enamored of China in ways that look seriously wrong today. In one secret 1973 memo to Nixon, he offered this startling proposition: “We are now in the extraordinary situation that, with the exception of the United Kingdom, the PRC might well be closest to us in its global perceptions. No other world leaders have the sweep and imagination of Mao and Chou.”

It was Henry Kissinger who saw himself as an intermediary far more often than American presidents or secretaries of state wanted him to play that role. | Wong Maye-E/AP

Kissinger’s role as an intermediary for presidents and world leaders was largely self-appointed.

Some of the obituaries and other stories about Kissinger’s death have described Kissinger as an intermediary between the United States and other countries, particularly China, after he left government. This notion seems to imply that American officials asked Kissinger to serve as an interlocutor — but that was usually not the case. Instead, Kissinger tended to insert himself as go-between, without being asked and even when unwanted.

Kissinger’s method of operation was this: He would travel on his own to China, often for commercial purposes. When he obtained audiences with Chinese leaders, he would take it upon himself to tell them what U.S. officials in Washington were saying and thinking. Then, back in the United States, he would show up at the White House or State Department and volunteer to tell American officials the thinking in Beijing. He sometimes did the same in Moscow, inserting himself unasked into ongoing Soviet or Russian diplomacy with the United States.

After being cast out of office in 1976 (after Jimmy Carter was elected president), he was repeatedly trying to get back in. At the 1980 Republican National Convention, he was one of the architects of a proposed deal in which former President Gerald Ford would become Ronald Reagan’s vice presidential nominee. Under the deal, Ford was to be co-president — and, in a provision many have forgotten, Kissinger was to return as Secretary of State and be granted complete control over American foreign policy. The Reagan team said no thanks. After Reagan became president, Kissinger secretly advised Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that “the Reagan administration had no coherent program to deal with the Soviet Union because Reagan had never thought about it seriously,” according to Dobrynin’s memoir. After George H.W. Bush won the 1988 election, and before he even took office, Kissinger proposed to the president-elect and his team that he take over Soviet diplomacy as the incoming administration’s principal emissary to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. That was too much for incoming Secretary of State James Baker, who scuttled Kissinger’s idea.

In short, it was Kissinger who saw himself as an intermediary far more often than American presidents or secretaries of state wanted him to play that role.

The Kissinger testimonials inflated his role in diplomacy with China until the end.

Some of the recent coverage of Kissinger’s death has suggested that he played a role in bringing about the recent flurry of high-level contacts between the Biden administration and China. This is said to have been based on Kissinger’s own visit to Beijing last summer.

But once again, the facts say otherwise. Kissinger visited China in mid-July. By that time, the Biden administration had already sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to Beijing, and discussion was already under way for Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping to visit the United States in November. Kissinger played no role in this diplomacy. If anything, his role was that, as in the past, the Chinese regime seized on Kissinger as a way of guilt-tripping Americans, sending the message that the United States has strayed from the good old days when American policy was to keep Beijing happy.

On China, Kissinger wasn’t as much of a realist as he claimed.

Of course, the obituaries characterize Henry Kissinger as a foreign policy realist. Philosophically, he was. And indeed, in many parts of the world, as his critics accurately note in the obits, Kissinger operated as a cold-blooded, even brutal realist.

But when it came to China, Kissinger was more of a romantic than a realist. During the opening to China his attachment to the Chinese regime became deeply personalized and emotional. (Later on, it became commercialized as well.) Nixon was far more the detached realist on China than Kissinger; in his later writings, the former president warned that China could rise to become a formidable adversary of the United States. Kissinger until his death resisted the idea that China was a U.S. adversary.

Consider one of Kissinger’s private memos to Nixon about China, this one after a 1973 visit to Beijing in which he met Mao Tse-tung. Mao, he wrote, “radiates authority and deep wisdom. … I was even more impressed by the grandeur of the Chairman this time than last. One can easily imagine the power and intelligence of this man in his prime.”

That is hardly the dispassionate judgment of a realist.

Henry Kissinger was many things, and his impact on U.S. foreign policy was significant and enduring. But when it comes to China in particular, his reputation is largely a result of his own myth-making. His actual record on China is much less flattering, a record that unfortunately rarely emerged in his obituaries.",political

"Transcript

My name is Larnell Lewis, drummer, composer, educator.

And today I've been challenged

to go through the levels of complexity at the drum kit.

[drum music]

This instrument has existed for over 100 years.

There have been tons of interpretations on it.

Just for today though, we're gonna hang out in my world.

And we're gonna go through

my interpretation of complexity on the drums.

So level one is the bass drum.

As a little bit of a precursor,

we're dealing in four, four time.

What that really explains is the value of the note,

and how many of those quarter notes exist in the bar.

I like to put the bass drum on one and three.

That's how we're gonna start.

[bass drum music]

Level two, we're gonna add the snare drum.

I like to consider the snare drum, the back beat.

That's a very common phrase that you'll hear in drumming.

It's similar to clapping.

We're gonna put the snare drum, or you're clapping,

on beat two and beats four, and that sounds like this.

[drum music]

Let's take it up a notch.

Level three, the hi-hat.

This is a really interesting kit piece,

meaning one of the parts of the drum kit.

And for the hi-hat,

it's something that you can do consistently.

We're gonna actually play the hi-hat

on all four quarter notes.

Now, let's put it all together.

[drum music]

Altogether, you call it a groove.

Another term for that is a drum pattern.

I'm gonna play two grooves.

One is a funk groove. I will evolve into that.

And the next one's a rock groove,

which I will also evolve into.

[drum music]

You may have noticed, with the hi-hat,

you were hearing a really sloshy, extended sound.

That was actually being achieved

by me raising my left foot just a little bit,

which allows the cymbals to spread apart,

[cymbal music]

and gives them that shimmering, sizzling sound.

So when I say open hi-hat. [cymbal music]

When I say closed hi-hat, [cymbal music] all right.

Beats that we've been hearing are these quarter notes.

And I'm playing what are called additional eighth notes,

but I'm accenting those as well.

In funk, you'll probably hear more of

a tighter hi-hat sound.

With rock, however, you will hear more open hi-hat

throughout the groove as your constant pattern.

When you're dealing with funk,

there's a term called on the one,

which means you're putting the emphasis on that downbeat,

which is with the bass drum.

Rock also shares that,

but it's a little more evenly spaced in terms of the energy

that you're putting on all of those beats.

So one emphasizes the downbeat, one smooths it out,

and you have clear sailing from top to bottom.

It might feel like it's a completely different style,

but they're neighboring styles.

And the complexity might just be

in the way that you play them.

But the patterns themselves aren't always

more complex in one way than another.

To help us lock in this groove a little bit more,

we should add some music.

This is a song of mine called Change Your Mind.

It's a little bit faster.

Get Ready. Let's Go for a Ride.

[funk music]

Let's move on. Level five, rudiments.

Rudiments are a grouping of notes or rhythms

that are also defined by what we like to call stickings.

Mentions of when you play your right hand,

versus your left hand.

The single stroke is a consistent set of notes

alternating between your right hand and your left hand.

Now, double strokes are two hits per hand.

Paraddile is a grouping of notes

which is a right, left, right, right.

[drum music]

These four notes can also be played the opposite way,

left, right, left, left.

Now a little bit faster for the right-handed,

and left-handed paraddile, alternating back and forth.

[dramatic music]

You can actually create a little more of an expression

with what you're playing by adding accents.

Accents are when you are playing

one note louder than another.

I'm gonna put the two paradiddles together now.

I'm gonna be accenting the first note

of each group of four notes.

Then the second time around,

I'm going to accent the second note

of each grouping of four notes.

[drum music]

I just wanna talk a little bit about the hi-hat bark.

Where we are, lifting our foot up, hitting the hi-hat,

and then closing our foot right back down again.

This takes a level of coordination,

because you need to time when you're opening your hi-hat,

or when you're lifting your foot

up against when you hit the hi-hat.

I could do it the other way around where I hit the hi-hat,

and then lift my foot, but it won't be the same effect.

So you lift your foot, strike the hi-hat,

and then bring your foot back down.

You can also do that in a variety of times.

So you can make it longer or extremely short.

But you can make it a little more complex

by adding another counter rhythm or syncopation,

let's say on your hi-hat, or on your bass drum,

or even on your snare drum.

Now, a syncopation is when you accent

something that's other than the strong beats,

or the average beats that you'd play in a bar.

[cymbal music]

Now, let's put it all together.

Next level, more complex grooves.

[drum music]

Now, the groove that you just heard

was similar to the pattern that we've learned already.

But I've actually added a couple of elements.

And I'm gonna break it down. Let's see what we get.

[drum music]

So for the most part,

I was playing one and three on the bass drum.

I've played an open hi-hat on the downbeat.

There was another skip note, or added 16th note,

that I was playing just before I played the downbeat.

I've also played some other rhythms,

or syncopations, on the bass drum.

Using syncopation you can create elaborate rhythms,

or even very simple rhythms that compliment

any drum groove that you're playing.

[drum music]

I actually snuck a paradiddle in there.

Right hand on the hi-hat, left hand on the snare.

[drum music]

Next level, polyrhythms.

Now, polyrhythms is next in the level of complexity,

really because it takes just a little bit more

than a level of our understanding of coordination.

A polyrhythm is actually

two rhythms layered on top of each other.

It makes a really interesting pattern that you hear overall.

The most standard version of a polyrhythm you'll hear

is the three over two.

[drum music]

Another one is the four over three.

So I'm gonna go from two over three,

and then I'm going to go to four over three.

[drum music]

Little more complex.

This one is going to be five over four.

[drum music]

Now, for the purpose of making sure that we

understand what this sounds like in a musical context,

we're gonna add the music again.

[funk music]

Next level, orchestration.

Which by the way, is just me taking a rhythm,

and putting one of my hands on a different

part of the drum set, but playing the same rhythm.

Sidebar, four-way independence, four-way coordination.

All of your limbs are playing different rhythms.

It's multiple rhythms happening

on multiple kit pieces at the same time.

[drum music]

We've built up solid bass through the rhythm,

through rudiments,

polyrhythms.

You can take all of those levels,

and you could reorchestrate anything that we've done so far.

If you remember our paradiddle from earlier,

I'm going to play it on the snare drum.

I'm going to take my right hand,

and I'm going to continue with that concept,

moving my right hand around

to different parts of the drum kit.

First tom, second tom, this other drum that I have here,

which is a snare drum, my floor tom.

And of course we can't forget the rest of the kit.

Crash cymbals.

I have another one that's a similar crash cymbal,

has a bunch of holes in it.

So if I play it very lightly, I get a really nice sizzle.

This is called a splash.

This is a trashformer, on top.

And I have another splash underneath it as well.

Here's another stack over here, the cymbal sandwich.

Three cymbals here.

The one on top is a 16 inch cymbal.

The one all the way on the bottom is a 14 inch China.

And in the middle is a really interesting looking cymbal

that has a lot of little holes in it.

Has a really nice trashy, rattly sound, like this.

[cymbal music]

And you can't forget the ride cymbal.

Now let's put this drum kit to good use.

Paradiddle reorchestrating,

right hand moving around to the different kit pieces.

[drum music]

And now, gotta have some music.

Moving the paradiddle around, adding a little more spice.

[funk music]

The beauty of orchestration,

is that it gives you a ton of options without needing

to change too much, rhythmically,

or with the rudiments that you're actually playing.

It actually moves you right into

the next level, which is drum fills.

[drum music]

A drum fill happens somewhere on the drum kit,

that takes you into another section of a song,

or helps to elevate the energy.

Sometimes it helps to bring the energy a little bit lower.

Any of the things that we've discussed before,

you can actually make those happen as drum fills.

I'm gonna play a drum groove,

and near the end of the drum groove, before I stop,

I'm going to play a drum fill.

[drum music]

Here's another example of that.

[drum music]

And a third option because, why not?

[drum music]

That's the power of drum fills.

The first one was probably a little more complex,

in terms of it had more rhythms going on.

The second one didn't have as many rhythms,

and it stayed on a couple of kit pieces.

[drum music]

And of course the last fill that I did was really sparse.

[drum music]

Meaning there wasn't a lot of information,

a lot of drumming happening.

And it gave that sense of going down a gear,

or we are about to get a little bit slower.

Now for something a little more advanced

a 30 second note drum fill.

[drum music]

Here's another option, a little more wild,

some crashes, sprinkle some stuff around.

[drum music]

Moving on from drum fills, we have embellishments.

[drum music]

Some people might think embellishments belong

just a little bit earlier.

But I actually like to add embellishments,

or ornamentation, after understanding drum fills.

When you know how to play a drum fill,

you can always push the envelope,

and embellish a certain part of the drum fill.

It's really just that added expression to the moment,

to take it up under the notch.

I'm actually going to level up a drum pattern

into a drum fill, with more embellishments as I go along.

[drum music]

There was a lot of improvised information,

and playing happening.

I started out with a main pattern,

and the type of things that I did were to

break up the monotonous flow.

[drum music]

So now I'm adding a really interesting element,

maybe on the hi-hat.

There was some activity that happened on the bass drum.

[drum music]

From there, I started adding some toms.

At this point, you're getting more energy, more excitement.

And I'm adding bits and pieces, adding cymbals, adding toms.

It's getting even bigger, to the point where

you may not even recognize the original pattern.

But now we are adding to the story.

We're adding to the excitement,

and take you even higher, and higher and higher,

until you get lost inside of all of it.

[drum music]

I'm gonna try it again.

But this time I'm gonna put a little more emphasis

on some of the lower drums.

I'm going to do what's called grounding the pattern

in a different way, by accenting rhythms

that feel like they're connected to the

stronger beats that we've been hearing,

whether it's beat one, two, three, or four.

Here we go.

[drum music]

I was grounding the overall pattern

by playing eighth notes on the floor toms,

so that you felt this really big [mimics drum beats].

[drum music]

Having lower tones at that part of the beat

was a really cool embellishment,

and helped to ground what you were hearing.

Then anything I added, whether it was toms or hi-hat,

these were all rhythms that took me

towards these bigger embellishments.

Eventually I changed the bass drum pattern,

so now the core drum pattern felt a little bit different.

But it had the same spirit.

Let's pull it all together.

You got grooves, polyrhythms,

four-way coordination,

embellishments,

orchestration.

So many of these things

are going to come together in a drum solo.

What you're about to hear is the last and final vamp section

of Change Your Mind going into the drum solo.

[funk music]

That's definitely one way to level up your heart rate.

My goodness.

Pro tip.

Make sure you're breathing when you're playing the drums.

One thing I've come to appreciate about

the levels of complexity of the drums, is that

once I understood from drumming how to find my voice,

I realized that I didn't have to always be complex.

I didn't have to always play really fast.

Because the purpose, for me,

is to drive home a story or drive home a feeling.

The art is in the way that you can hang left, right,

or go straight through all of these levels of complexity.

I hope you learned something.

And if you didn't, you better hit rewind.

And make sure you go out and learn how to express yourself.

It's levels to this thing.

"Ramaswamy’s bullying tactics may be outrageous, but they’re not entirely original, Juvonen noted in an interview with POLITICO Magazine.

“He has a role model — Trump — who did it masterfully,” she said. Like the former president, she added, “Ramaswamy is not trying to be a likable person. He is simply trying to appear powerful.”

So, how should a 2024 candidate respond if they start to get bullied on the debate stage Wednesday night?

Juvonen has some ideas on what not to do, most of all: Don’t have an emotionally charged reaction and don’t simply express submissive behavior. “Those are the two most maladaptive strategies,” she said. Instead, try to level with the person who was hostile to them. “If we think about Ramaswamy’s behavior as being bullying, Nikki Haley’s very calm response, ‘You’re scum’ may have worked,” she said.

(In response, Ramaswamy senior adviser Tricia McLaughlin said, “What an abject embarrassment to journalism. Of course, POLITICO won’t mention that in every single one of the last debates Nikki has called Vivek 4-letter-words. But, sure, her two X chromosomes make her a real victim. ... If you can’t take the heat stay out of the kitchen.”)

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

You study teenage behavior and bullying in particular. Do you think what Vivek Ramaswamy has done on the debate stage is an example of bullying?

Definitely. In terms of him attacking his competitors and attacking them with personal information, like in Haley’s case talking about her daughter. Bullies often strategize to hurt their victims in ways that really get to them. Finding their weak positions and obviously, in this case, family and children.

Research on youth shows that status and respect can be gained not only by bullying but also by being a prosocial and charismatic leader. The question is why the candidates do not use such strategies. They do require more skill than bullying.

Would you say he’s acting like a teenager when he squares off this way with Nikki Haley and others?

He is definitely using these strategies, hostile strategies to gain power, and that’s what bullying really is all about: to gain power and status.

And obviously, he has a role model — Trump — who did it masterfully, masterfully, in the sense that by doing that, he did not lose popularity but seemed to be gaining popularity. When I talk about popularity, that is not about likeability. That’s a really important distinction. Popularity is status, and you can be a high status and popular, cool person without being liked. Ramaswamy is not trying to be a likable person. He is simply trying to appear powerful.

It is probably no coincidence that Ramaswamy attacked Haley the most. Trump first attacked women also. Women are generally perceived to have less power and hence they make “safe” victims. I believe Haley may be proving otherwise.

You mentioned Donald Trump’s bullying in previous years — you think we’re seeing his influence today?

I think both of them are trying to put other people down in order to gain power. So that’s kind of a very primitive strategy that we see among politicians. That is, you’re not competing with expertise. You’re not competing against one another with knowledge. This is all about sort of huffing and puffing.

And obviously Trump managed to do this well before, and it seems to me that he’s relying on similar strategies this time around. Ramaswamy, I think, is essentially modeling the behavior and trying to put his competitors down the best he can.

Should other candidates bully him back, or should they respond differently? Was Nikki Haley right to call him “scum”?

Yeah, that’s a tough one. Based on research on bullying, we know more about what doesn’t work in terms of trying to get back at the bully. One is an emotionally very charged reaction, kind of blowing up. That doesn’t work, and neither does submissive behavior. That is just taking it and not kind of weathering or withdrawing from the situation. Those are the two most maladaptive strategies.

What works is a little less clear. If you think about bullying being about power dynamics, then one strategy might be for politicians to level with the person who was hostile to them. If we think about Ramaswamy’s behavior as being bullying, Nikki Haley’s very calm response, “You’re scum,” may have worked. It is not emotionally charged, but it is basically, “Hey, you’re calling on me or you’re, you’re putting me down. I’m going to respond.”

One would think that they need to do more than just engage in bullying behavior, but really try to do more to appeal to their audiences. I think Nikki Haley is trying to show off her expertise, so knowledge is power in that sense. Because if it’s just back and forth, calling names, that’s not going to go very far.

When does bullying go too far?

Well, you know, in a democracy with adults and experts in the political arena, that bullying strategy would be a really juvenile and very primitive tactic. It suggests that there’s nothing else that you can compete with. Bullying as a strategy to win votes is an incredibly low strategy. It has worked in the past. Whether it continues to work remains to be seen.

Especially during times of uncertainty, with economic uncertainty in the minds of American voters, that’s when people — whether we’re talking about kids or we’re talking about adults — want to find a powerful leader.

Bullying has no place in political debates and especially in presidential debates. Compared to other democratic countries, where else would we see such behavior? I never witnessed or heard of any such behavior in Finland, where I am from, and believe that in lots of European nations that would also be the case even today.

Who was a bigger bully, Trump or Ramaswamy?

It’s probably slightly different when we talk about bullying among kids or teenagers as opposed to bullying tactics being used by politicians. I would imagine that in the case of Nikki Haley, that kind of very personal attack, at least among women voters would gain sympathy.

Name-calling seems kind of harmless. But I have to say I’m amazed if that is a strategy that can work in the political arena. Going after Haley’s daughter may get more sympathy from the audience. Name-calling doesn’t get sympathy but why it seems to be working is a big puzzle to me.

Should we be worried that our kids are watching these debates and are being encouraged to bully others?

Absolutely. Absolutely. We had actually made a lot of progress on bullying in schools in particular, before Trump’s successful candidacy. And when he continued his behavior as president, it really sort of transformed schools back to where we had started.

There’s no question that powerful public individuals, our prime role models, are the influencers. When adults in powerful positions are engaging in that behavior, that gives the kids the right to use the same behavior. If anything, what they see is only the benefits of the behavior, never the downsides. So this has been horrible all around.",political

Dear Under,

Your question made me think about Diana Christensen, a main character in Paddy Chayefsky’s 1976 film Network, played by Faye Dunaway. Christensen is a young network news executive who is meant to represent the moral bankruptcy of a generation that was raised on TV (one character calls her “television incarnate”). While charismatic and highly capable, she is also rampantly amoral, viciously competitive, and so obsessed with ratings that she famously has an orgasm while discussing viewership numbers. The character clearly piqued a pervasive cultural anxiety about TV’s corrupting influence, though with a little distance it’s hard not to see her depiction in the film as moralizing and heavy-handed. As The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael put it in her review, “What Chayefsky is really complaining about is what barroom philosophers have always complained about: the soulless worshippers at false shrines—the younger generation.”

I mention the film only to get out of the way the most obvious objection to your freak-out, one I’m sure you’ve already considered—namely, that every generation fears new forms of media are “false shrines” corrupting the youth, and that these concerns are ultimately myopic, reactionary, and destined to appear in hindsight as so much unfounded hand-wringing. Before Diana Christensen, there were the studio bullies in Norman Mailer’s novel The Deer Park (1955), who represented the degeneracy of Hollywood, and the ruthless newspaper men in Howard Hawks’ film His Girl Friday (1940), who are referred to as “inhuman.” If you want to go back even further, consider the bewilderment often experienced by modern readers of Mansfield Park, Jane Austen’s 1814 novel whose dramatic apex rests on a father’s outrage at coming home to find that his children have decided to put on a play.

Rest assured, Under, that I am not trying to dismiss your question through appeals to historical relativism. Pointing out that a problem has antecedents does not compromise its validity. It’s possible, after all, that humanity is on a steady downhill slide, that each new technological medium, and the professions it spawns, is progressively more soulless than the last. The many journalists who’ve cited the 2019 poll claiming that 30 percent of US and UK children want to be YouTubers when they grow up have frequently juxtaposed that figure with the dearth of kids who want to be astronauts (11 percent), as though to underscore the declining ambitions of a society that is no longer “reaching for the stars” but aiming instead for the more lowly consolations of stardom.

If I were to guess your objections to influencing as a future occupation for your daughter, I imagine they might include the fact that the profession, for all its vaunted democratic appeal—anyone can be famous!—conceals its competitive hierarchies; that its spoils are unreliable and largely concentrated at the top; that it requires becoming a vapid mascot for brands; that it fails to demand meaningful contributions to one’s community; that it requires a blurring between personal and professional roles; that the mandates of likes, shares, and followers amount to a life of frenetic people-pleasing and social conformity that inevitably destroys one’s capacity for independent thinking.

I’m also willing to bet there is a deeper fear humming beneath those seemingly rational objections—one that is related, incidentally, to the very notion of influence. Parenting is, at the end of the day, an extended experiment in influencing. You hope to instill your values, politics, and moral and ethical awareness in your children, yet as they make their way into the world, it becomes clear that there are other influences at war with your own. Influence, it has been noted in this era of epidemics, shares a root word with influenza, an etymology that echoes the popular notion that ideas are free-floating pathogens that someone can catch without giving their conscious consent. I think this is how many parents regard the social technologies their children use, as hosts for various contagions that must be staved off with more deliberate moral instruction given at home. To realize the extent to which these digital platforms have fascinated your daughter is to feel that you have failed to inoculate her.

Or maybe your uneasiness goes even deeper than that. If I can turn the problem back on you, perhaps your instinctive aversion to your daughter’s aspirations has raised more probing questions about the source and validity of your own values. Any serious attempt to think through the perils and possibilities of new technologies forces you to realize that many of your own beliefs are little more than amorphous, untested assumptions, formed by the era in which you were raised. Are the artists you grew up idolizing—musicians, filmmakers, novelists—any less shallow and narcissistic than the TikTok and YouTube personalities your daughter idolizes? The answer to this question is not a given. But if you consider it honestly and persistently, I suspect you will discover that you are not an isolated moral agent but porous to the biases and blind spots of the decades in which you came of age.

Such realizations can easily inspire fatalism, but they can also lead to a more expansive and meaningful understanding of your own fears. My intent in reminding you of the anxieties of previous generations—all that collective angst about television, movies, newspapers, and theater—is to help you see your situation as part of a lineage, a rite of passage through which all generations must proceed. (If we are to believe Plato’s Phaedrus, even Socrates fell prey to griping about the popularity of writing, a medium he feared would “produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.”) To see this problem historically might also prompt you to consider, as a parent, what kinds of life lessons transcend the particulars of a given economy.

I would like to believe that alongside all the ephemeral inherited assumptions we absorb in our youth, there are some pearls of enduring wisdom that will remain true and valuable for generations to come. Ideally, it’s these more lasting truths that you want to pass down to your daughter, and that will equip her to have an influence, no matter what she chooses for work.

Call them the Qatargate annual reports.

A vast cache of leaked documents from the police investigation into the biggest corruption case to hit the EU in decades — seen by POLITICO — uncovers the full extent of the European Parliament’s money-for-influence scandal.

Over four years the files suggest that key suspects, including former Member of the European Parliament Pier Antonio Panzeri and his aide Francesco Giorgi, meticulously recorded alleged attempts to manipulate the Parliament, the EU’s foremost democratic body, and wider policy debates.

Their suspected paymasters in Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania spent around €4 million for the work, according to claims in the files.

The scandal first came to light exactly a year ago this week, when Panzeri, Giorgi and other key figures were arrested in a series of dramatic raids involving bags of cash and lurid tales of foreign interference at the heart of EU democracy.

Read more: Denial, grief, acceptance: Inside the Qatargate police interrogations – POLITICO

The actions recorded in the documents include some with a significant impact on the workings of the European Union — such as scheming to kill off six parliamentary resolutions condemning Qatar’s human rights record, and working to deliver a visa-free travel deal between Doha and the EU.

But the operations could also be petty: Giorgi once noted that every copy of an unflattering book on Qatar that could be found within the Parliament had been diligently “destroyed.”

Among the files seen by POLITICO was an eight-tab spreadsheet on Giorgi’s laptop, seized at his flat in Brussels, listing hundreds of influence activities the network allegedly carried out between 2018 and 2022.

The spreadsheet records more than 300 pieces of work for which the suspects received handsome fees. They allegedly achieved their ends using a network of associates working inside the Parliament, whom they called their “soldiers,” according to the files.

So far the inquiry has seen four current and former MEPs arrested on preliminary charges of corruption, money laundering and membership of a criminal organization. The suspects include Panzeri, Giorgi and Eva Kaili, Giorgi’s partner and a Brussels high-flier who was ousted from her role as the Parliament’s vice president when the scandal broke.

While investigators suspect that Panzeri and his network were manipulating the Parliament on behalf of Qatar and other states, the documents suggest they were also trying to exploit foreign officials’ lack of knowledge about EU democracy.

Giorgi told police he and his boss would sometimes tell their paymasters about operations over which they had no practical influence, as Panzeri misrepresented the extent of his power to shape the Parliament’s work, according to the documents.

“It relied on the ignorance of how parliament works,” Giorgi said in statements to the police.

A person familiar with Giorgi’s legal defense, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was “not credible” to think of the spreadsheet as proof of the influence activities. Instead, the person said, the list was designed to “boost” Panzeri’s image to his clients.

Whether they are a record of actual influence work or just a tool to inflate the bill, the spreadsheet entries offer a unique glimpse into the workings of the influence machine built and run by Panzeri, Giorgi and their alleged accomplices, until a police investigation in December 2022 brought it all to an abrupt end. The documents also raise questions over how such influence operations could go unnoticed for so long.

As European leaders confront the ignominious one-year anniversary of the scandal, which erupted on December 9 last year, the disclosures contained in the Qatargate Files will submit the EU’s ethical standards to intense scrutiny once again.

The alleged operations included:

The big deal

* Working for Qatar, Giorgi and Panzeri were building up to one bigger prize: ensuring that Doha clinched an agreement for visa-free travel with the EU. The deal received an essential green light in the Parliament’s civil liberties committee in December 2022, days before Giorgi and Panzeri were arrested. A final vote on the deal has been put on hold since the scandal erupted.

The win makes it to the spreadsheet. Other documents from Giorgi’s laptop reveal he intended to suggest to the Qataris two “Action Plan[s]” detailing whom to contact and where to exert pressure to secure the visa agreement.

* A precondition for securing the visa deal, Giorgi and Panzeri argued, was staving off attempts by some MEPs to censure Qatar for its treatment of migrant workers and journalists. In his spreadsheet, Giorgi takes credit for “neutralizing” six parliamentary resolutions condemning Qatar between June 2021 and November 2022. The Parliament did, however, eventually pass a resolution criticizing Qatar’s human rights record on November 24, 2022.

Manipulating parliamentary hearings

* Qatar’s football World Cup preparations were subject to intense criticism over the alleged exploitation of migrant workers. Giorgi’s spreadsheet boasted they “changed narrative in parliament” on the issue, during a committee hearing in April 2021 featuring an appearance by a Qatari official.

* In February 2020, the suspects prepared detailed notes for an appearance by Qatar’s foreign minister at the Parliament’s foreign affairs committee. They also ensured the presence of certain MEPs “for targeted questions.”

Political attacks on Qatar’s rivals

* One operation in 2021, for example, targeted the appointment of a senior police official from the United Arab Emirates, Naser Al-Raisi, as the new president of Interpol. Relations between Qatar and UAE, its Gulf neighbor, had been fraught, with diplomatic ties severed between 2017 and 2021. Like many politicians and NGOs at the time, Panzeri’s friend, MEP Maria Arena, urged EU countries to resist Al-Raisi’s nomination. Panzeri and Giorgi took credit for Arena’s letter, though it is unclear whether she knew they were doing so. Arena’s lawyer told POLITICO she had not been charged as part of the police inquiry and declined to comment further.

* Another operation targeted Saudi Arabia, which had cut diplomatic and economic relations with Qatar. Panzeri and Giorgi billed Qatar for a package of actions including a series of tweets and film screenings relating to the murder of Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi, while strongly condemning Riyadh’s responsibility for the killing.

Morocco and Mauritania

* When it came to defending Morocco, Panzeri and Giorgi took pride in passing a parliamentary resolution against Algeria, which they said would benefit Morocco.

* The team also bragged of clinching a “more moderate text” on a resolution that criticized Morocco over its handling of a migration crisis in 2021. The resolution censured Morocco for easing border controls and allowing 8,000 migrants including unaccompanied children to cross into Spanish territory during a dispute with the Madrid government.

* According to the documents, Mauritania’s main aim was to improve its public image. Giorgi’s spreadsheet suggested that the group worked to try to stop an anti-slavery activist, who had made enemies in the Mauritanian government, from winning the EU’s prestigious Sakharov Prize for human rights.

The revelations included in the Qatargate Files are likely to reignite debate in the Parliament about whether the legislature has itself done enough to ensure similar operations don’t happen again. While the Parliament has introduced tighter procedures in response to the scandal, many in Brussels regard the reforms as half-hearted, at best.

“These documents show us that this was a sustained, multiannual effort to nefariously influence parliamentary procedures,” said Nick Aiossa, acting director of Transparency International EU. “It happened over years with multiple people, and it wasn’t discovered. So what else is out there?”

“The response by the Parliament has been weak, meager and certainly doesn’t speak to the severity of the scandal that happened last December,” Aiossa added.

Daniel Freund, a German Greens MEP, stated in reaction to POLITICO’s investigation: “It seems the scheme is a lot bigger than what we had so far learnt.”

He said the main problem was that the Parliament has not conducted an internal inquiry into the impact of the alleged influence operations on its democratic activities and decisions.

Freund said: “It seems you can buy or at least influence certain decisions in the Parliament, or at the very least there are some former MEPs that try to make everybody believe that you can and are selling that as a product.”

“It becomes ever clearer that there might have been a number of procedures [in the Parliament] that are put into question, at the very least,” Freund said. “Now it needs a proper process inside the Parliament, that we look at [whether this is] just inflated bullshit from those two … or is it real? Has there been influence on any of those procedures? Do we have to reconsider certain decisions?”

A spokesperson for the Parliament said the institution could not conduct an internal investigation into potential criminal activities. “But it can cooperate fully and promptly with the competent authorities, and this is what we have done,” the spokesperson said. Parliament President Roberta Metsola had “personally facilitated the investigation” by being “present at the house searches of two Belgian MEPs (in December 2022 and in July 2023) as requested by the Belgian Constitution, something unprecedented in the EP’s history,” the spokesperson added.

Following the first allegations of corruption, Metsola presented 14 measures to reinforce the Parliament’s firewalls and improve transparency. The legislature has also joined the Belgian legal case as a civil plaintiff in order to “detect if any damage to the EP budget has been done in any of the activities and recover the money,” the spokesperson said.

Morocco’s foreign affairs minister, who has previously denied the country’s involvement in the scandal, did not reply to multiple requests for comment from POLITICO. Qatar has rejected allegations it interfered in EU democracy. Mauritania has not responded to several emailed questions about its alleged involvement in the scheme.

Kaili has denied all wrongdoing. “The investigation shows that Ms Kaili has never spoken in favor of Morocco or Mauritania,” Kaili’s lawyer Michalis Dimitrakopoulos said in an email to POLITICO. “According to documents from the investigation, the Belgian secret services underlined that there was no evidence that Ms Kaili was involved in the network, or that she received any money.”

Panzeri has admitted guilt in a plea deal he struck with authorities, which emerged in January. Giorgi has acknowledged his involvement in the schemes, according to the files seen by POLITICO. Lawyers for the two men declined to comment for this article.",political
"A decade ago, at the Spike Video Game Awards, Hello Games made a splash by announcing the wildly ambitious sci-fi exploration game No Man’s Sky. This evening, at the 2023 edition of The Game Awards, the studio did it again, revealing Light No Fire. This time, instead of offering a massive universe of different planets to explore, the game is focused on a single, incredibly detailed world.

According to Hello’s Sean Murray, the game has been in development for the last five years by a small team. He describes it as “the first real open world” with no boundaries, which also has an online multiplayer component. From the trailer it appeared to have elements like crafting and mining, and also the ability to ride flying mounts.

Here’s the official description:

Light No Fire is a game about adventure, building, survival, and exploration together. Set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth, it brings the depth of a role playing game to the freedom of a survival sandbox.

Of course, it was a long road from that initial announcement of No Man’s Sky. After being revealed in 2013, it finally launched in 2016 and has since come to a wide range of platforms and grown thanks to a steady stream of updates. Last year, it hit version 4.0, and already in 2023, it’s expanded to the Mac and PlayStation VR2.",technology
"The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, pleaded guilty yesterday to criminal charges in the US, releasing a wave of pent-up tension that had hung over the crypto industry for years.

Zhao, who also went by CZ, was one of the poster boys for crypto’s freewheeling and rebellious spirit, which hearkens back to the origins of the technology, built to undergird a parallel financial system outside the control of any government or bank. Under his leadership, Binance grew to become by far the world’s largest crypto exchange, but frequently clashed with regulators in the US and elsewhere. The company refused to establish a formal headquarters. According to the criminal indictment filed against Zhao in the US, he “prioritized growth and profits over compliance” and sought to take advantage of what he described as the “gray zone.” Zhao instructed employees that it was “better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” the indictment states.

Although Zhao frequently tried to shrug off criticism of Binance on X, formerly Twitter, the investigation into the firm by the US Department of Justice was an open secret. It was also a source of collective anxiety for stakeholders across the industry, in which Binance had become deeply entrenched. If the exchange were to have buckled under the stress of a criminal conviction, the damage to investors would have been catastrophic and the ripple effects far-reaching.

The agreement cut between Binance and the DOJ—under which the exchange must pay a $4.3 billion penalty, operate under tightened supervision by US authorities, and replace Zhao as CEO—is among the best possible outcomes for crypto. “It cleans up the industry’s image,” says market analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis. “Zhao could have laid low in any one of a number of no-extradition jurisdictions,” she says, but his guilty plea sends the message that Binance “wants to work with regulators going forward.”

There is an extent to which Zhao was the last of his breed. In the wake of the collapse of crypto markets in May 2022, which brought to an end a period of frenzied hype and reckless spending that sent the price of crypto tokens to record highs, many of the industry’s figureheads have either been charged with or convicted of felonies. In February, the US government brought charges against Do Kwon, creator of the Terra-Luna stablecoin whose collapse in spring 2022 tipped the first fateful domino in the industry. In July, the DOJ charged Alex Mashinsky, founder of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, with “orchestrating a scheme to defraud customers.” Earlier this month, Sam Bankman-Fried, leader of crypto exchange FTX and archrival to Zhao, was found guilty of overseeing a multibillion-dollar fraud.

Binance’s new chief executive is of a pointedly different flavor, though. Replacing Zhao is Richard Teng, a former regulator who has little public profile. Teng had been tipped as a successor to Zhao since his promotion to head of regional markets at Binance in June, though he refused to be drawn on the question in an interview with crypto outlet CoinDesk at the time. He previously held the role of head of Asia, Europe, and MENA at the exchange.

A source with knowledge of the company’s succession plan tells WIRED that Teng is well respected among Binance employees and a popular choice for the role.

Acheson says the appointment of Teng—formerly CEO at Abu Dhabi Global Market, a financial regulator in the United Arab Emirates—can be interpreted as another sign that “Binance wants to cooperate with regulators.”",technology
"Tesla announced a new “Powershare” vehicle-to-load charging capability, only available on the new Cybertruck.

The feature will allow Cybertruck owners to power their camping equipment, power tools, or even their entire home during a blackout, just by using their electric truck as a mobile generator. The truck also features a 240-volt outlet in the rear bed that can be used to charge other EVs. An image on Tesla’s website shows the Cybertruck charging a Model Y.

The Cybertruck can put out as much as 11.5kW, which is more than the Ford F-150 Lightning’s 9.6kW of onboard power or the GMC Sierra Denali EV’s 10.2kW.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk seemed to pour cold water on the idea earlier this year, complaining that most people wouldn’t want bidirectional charging because all their lights would go out when they unplugged their car.

Tesla has been talking about manufacturing vehicles with bidirectional charging capabilities for several years now

Bidirectional charging works exactly like it sounds: with unidirectional (one-way) EV chargers, electricity flows from the electric grid into the electric vehicle; with bidirectional (two-way) EV chargers, electricity can flow both ways.

The idea is to use bidirectional charging equipment to push and pull energy from electric vehicles at any given time. In essence, it treats high-capacity lithium-ion batteries not only as tools to power EVs but also as backup storage cells to charge other electric devices, an entire home, or even to send power to the electrical grid for possible energy savings.

Tesla is also offering ways to control bidirectional charging through the company’s mobile app. Customers can monitor the charging process, adjust preferences, and review energy usage and other data in real time.

Customers who want to take advantage of the Powershare feature in their homes will need a Tesla Powerwall (of course) and a Wall Connector for the most seamless connection.",technology
"Ozempic and Wegovy’s usefulness might not stop at weight loss. For more than a decade, research has emerged that similar drugs used to treat diabetes have a surprising side-effect: They make people want to drink less alcohol—way less.

The apparent effectiveness of drugs like semaglutide won’t come as a surprise to doctors who have been prescribing these drugs to patients for years. In 2011, researchers in India found that a drug called liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor used to treat diabetes, significantly reduced alcohol intake in a small group of patients. In fact, nine of the 63 participants surveyed had stopped drinking altogether.

Hints that these kinds of drugs could be used in the treatment of alcoholism go back even further. The first GLP-1 receptor agonist came on the market back in 2005 in the form of exenatide, and the accompanying waning thirst for alcohol has been reported anecdotally over and over ever since. “Some of [the patients] wanted to have a break going on holidays, because they wanted to be able to enjoy a glass of red wine,” says Mette Kruse Klausen, a postdoctoral researcher at the Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen in Denmark. If it were the case that this already-approved, safe drug could stem alcohol cravings, its potential to treat alcohol use disorder, or AUD—estimated to afflict over 280 million people worldwide—was tantalizing.

Follow-up research was slow. First, researchers had to test the application out on animals, which they did—and it did show promise in using GLP-1 receptor agonists for reducing alcohol intake.

Research in humans followed: A randomized clinical trial in Denmark led by Kruse Klausen started in 2017 looking at treating patients with AUD with exenatide. It worked with 127 patients with AUD; half got exenatide, half a placebo. A setback followed: Researchers found that exenatide did not lead to a reduction in the number of heavy-drinking days between the two groups.

Researchers working on the study theorized that the lack of efficacy could have been due to the cognitive behavioral therapy offered to both groups. Another factor could have been that severity of the patients’ AUD was lower than that of other trials looking at treatments for AUD—and research on interventions for people with AUD is just difficult to do, says Kruse Klausen, due to the high dropout rate. Another analysis of the data found that the drug was effective at significantly reducing alcohol intake–but only in the participants who qualified as obese.

Another reason for the trial’s failure could be that exenatide is much less potent than its newer cousin semaglutide, better known as Ozempic. Now that Ozempic is everywhere, anecdotal evidence is mounting that these drugs reduce cravings not just for food, but for online shopping, smoking, nail-biting, and alcohol.",technology
"How much does the Cybertruck really cost?

Tesla has a TON of new accessories for its all-new Cybertruck — camp equipment, snow tires, truck stuff, this $55 decal of a broken window — so I was curious how much a top-trim truck (the tri-motor Cyberbeast version) with all the bells and whistles would cost. Because I assume true Tesla fans are going to want to support their favorite struggling billionaire.

The grand total, including all the accessories and Full Self-Driving, comes out to an eye-watering $126,860. That’s even more than the Hummer EV! And about double the average transaction price for a new truck in the US, according to Edmunds. Cyber-gulp!",technology

Everything in the body has some meaning.

We're gonna take a look, starting at the head

and going all the way down to the toes,

at some of the most interesting body parts

that have often been categorized as maybe useless.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Auricular muscles.

Some people have muscles

where they can wiggle their ears a little bit.

These are rare.

We have three on the outside, so these are remnant

auricular muscles that originally had great functions,

particularly with sound the way your dog or your cat do.

Even in many of the monkeys

our ancestors ears are able to move a bit with sound,

but now they've largely lost that function

and they are usually considered vestigial.

The term vestigial comes from the Latin meaning footprints,

so there are structures that were thought

to be sort of footprints in time,

giving us little clues to what came before.

So we, when we hear a sound

do not necessarily move our ears in that direction.

We tend to move our entire head towards the sound.

What's interesting to show that it's still hooked up,

studies have shown that when we hear a sound,

the brain areas that deal with these muscles

have some activity.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Pica Semilunaris.

When you look at the medial side of the eye area

you're going to see a vertical line.

Here is the location.

Next time you look at a dog or a cat or a reptile,

you'll notice that they don't have two,

but they have three eyelids.

We have an up, we have a down,

they have one that goes side to side.

That's the nictitating membrane

and this little fold is the remnant.

We know we don't have it in our closest relative, the chimp,

and we don't have it in ourselves.

It's a moister,

and apparently we have sufficient moistening

without needing that.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Wisdom teeth.

Technically known as our third molars.

You can see here they're largely problematic,

in which they bend or twist,

and you have to go to the oral surgeon to have them removed.

Over the eons of our evolutionary changes,

our diet became very varied.

The molars are grinding teeth for eating leaves

and vegetable type things.

We became more omnivorous.

This is a gorilla,

and you can see how the face is very forward in a gorilla.

In the course of human evolution

our face became very flattened in.

Our molar teeth became shoved all the way back.

The molars became squished in.

We developed a very, very pronounced chin,

found only in homo sapiens.

It's a distinguishing feature of our species

and we're not exactly clear what made it come about.

It's a byproduct.

It's called a spandrel.

Sometimes things occur

in our body that had no discreet meaning or function.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Male nipples.

Nipples are extremely important structures.

They're important for breastfeeding,

but why do I have a nipple?

The male nipple is not useless.

It's highly stimulatable.

It is an erogenous zone,

and these are not unimportant things.

By the way, for example, dogs and cats,

they have multiple nipples.

There's a developmental ridge where nipples appear.

That's called the nipple line.

Nipples can appear all along a series of lines

and you may find, for example,

that somebody has a nipple all the way down in the pelvis

or frequently in the armpit is a bit of a throwback.

We sometimes call it an atavism,

and that term is usually used

for something that has missed a few generations

or something that pops up

due to an interesting recombination of genes.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Body hair.

We have hair, but our hair is not densely packed

all over like our closest relatives.

Hair's prime function is for thermo-regulation

and it played a very vital part when our ancestors

came from forest-like environments, helping to keep heat in,

when it got too hot, it kept heat away.

We lost our hair.

The weather was changing,

things were shifting on the planes of Africa

and our ancestors started to go to savannahs.

We were starting to be bipedal.

We were starting to be hunters.

We were starting to learn to run,

and the loss of hair helped us in our active lifestyles

with sweating.

The glands involved in sweating are much greater in us

and it allows us to maintain our temperatures better.

Hair in our furry relatives had a purpose,

with little babies being able to hang onto it.

We think we still maintain the little grasp reflex

of newborns and that has been related back to it.

Certain areas in primates, particularly apes,

became hairless early on, the face.

We do a lot of signaling with our face, so do chimps,

so do gorillas.

We do retain some hair, on the top of our head,

in our anal genital area and in our armpit area.

The brain has to be kept somewhat cool,

hair up there aids in cooling the area and protecting it

and that's why they seem to be retained.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Arrector pili muscles produce the effect of goosebumps.

Here's a hair, here's an arrector pili.

What they do when they're stimulated is they contract.

They force the hair to stand erect.

It'll aid in the skin responding to some type of threat.

You'll get the hair stand up in the back of your neck.

When this occurs in our ancestors or your cat,

the hair will become puffed up.

What does that puffiness do?

It increases the appearance of your size

so it's a display feature as well.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Appendix.

This is called the cecum

and this worm-like structure coming off of it

is known as the appendix.

It's not useless, it's very useful.

Because it was removable

the appendix was thought to be vestigial,

and worse, bad, because it can swell.

What we've learned over the last few years is

that the appendix has helpful bacteria

and assists the gut when there are different problems

and diseases.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Coccyx.

The coccyx was our primitive tale.

Here we can look

and see the vertebral column,

the last three to five vertebrae that comprise

the little funky thing that looks

like a cuckoo's beak that's known as the coccyx.

This is a vestigial structure.

A distinguishing difference between great apes

and monkeys is that none of the apes have tails.

Our ape ancestors do not locomote

the same way a monkey does, swinging through a tree,

they locomote differently.

The more these animals started to walk on all fours

and then with us to walk bipedally,

the tails were not useful any longer,

and so it was pushed to the side, it became a vestige.

Every once in a while,

pretty rare, due to an interesting recombination of genes,

somebody is born with a tail.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Pyramidalis muscle.

If you look in the mirror, you will notice your six pack.

I don't have a six pack anymore.

I never had a six pack.

This forms what's called the rectus sheath.

We have a muscle called the pyramidalis

because of its shape.

At one time it was thought to give support to the abdomen.

Various monkeys are shown to have it,

in us it's become very small

and we're not really certain what it does.

We might have lost it

because of our unique mode of bipedal locomotion.

Every time we've modified our locomotor behavior

certain muscles enlarge, certain muscles become less.

We have a number of muscles

in the body that have become largely vestigial.

They've shrunk.

Their function has shifted.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Plantaris muscle.

We have a muscle in the leg

which has become largely vestigial.

It's become just a tendon.

The plantaris comes from the area of the knee,

comes from the femur

and goes all the way down to have a separate tendon.

They are larger in the apes.

We have a number of muscles

in the body that have become largely vestigial,

they've shrunk.

Their function has shifted.

[pointer clicking] [upbeat music]

Flat feet.

The human foot has been modified solely

for the purposes of ambulation for running.

In order to do that, we have a double arch system.

One arch goes from front to back.

We call this a longitudinal arc

and another go side to side to reduce muscle usage.

This is one reason why a chimp

or a gorilla cannot ambulate or run the way we can.

They don't have double arches.

Their feet tend to be flatter

and every once in a while we'll have somebody

who genetically born with flat feet.

Here's an individual who is showing

what we call pes planus, or flat feet.

The arches sink.

When the arches sink

the muscles that go underneath it must fire

so anybody with flat feet has to use muscles

to try to pull those arches up, and that's very expensive.

I'll also tell you how you can damage your arches.

Nobody ever anticipated something like high heeled shoes.

They're dangerous, they're hurtful,

and they work to destroy

what nature has taken millions of years to create.

There have been body parts

that have diminished greatly in function.

We have things that we thought may have been useless

that we've discovered are very useful,

so our body is the culmination of our history.

"What does access mean to you? What about scientific merit? What are the things you take for granted that you aren’t even aware of because of your privilege? For Dr. Dara Norman, who is deputy director of the Community Science and Data Center at NOIRLab and the incoming president-elect of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), these are issues she grapples with every day.

Dr. Norman is an astronomer, and she uses her knowledge, background, and training in order to understand the challenges others face within her field.

Ensuring Scientists Have Access to Data

“For astronomers, all you get is light.” Dr. Norman says with a smile. You can see the love of astronomy and science on her face as she speaks.

“In other science fields, you can set up an experiment, or you can get samples of rocks or samples of other things to bring back to your lab and analyze them. But for astronomers, all you get is the light that comes back from galaxies or stars.

“With that light, you have to try to figure out the mass of that star or the mass of that galaxy, what the temperature is. If there are pressures that are in there holding up the star, what are those pressures? You have to understand the evolution of those objects, where those objects sit, how old they are, and how they evolved to be the way they are, right? And you get all of that just from the light that comes back,” she says.

Being able to interpret and understand what that light means, as well as the large data sets that we get back, is crucial to any astronomer’s job. As deputy director of the Community Science and Data Center at NOIRLab (the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory), the United States’ national center for all optical and infrared telescopes funded by the National Science Foundation, by doing her job Dr. Norman allows others to do theirs.

“We help the broad astronomy community use both the telescopes and data,” she explains. “The mission of the Community Science and Data Center is really to do user support and help people get time on those telescopes through a peer review process, and also help them get and use the data that we keep—whether it’s their data or data in the archives that anybody can use.”",technology

Alas, the same is also true of the action figures depicting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

In fact, a lot of the most prominently displayed political icons this season have been dead a lot longer than Ginsburg: Abigail Adams, Alice Paul, Harriet Tubman. “For this gifting season, oh boy, we have a real lack of names,” Bridget Barrett, a University of Colorado advertising professor who researches political merchandise, told me.

There is no tote bag equivalent of the New York Times bestseller list, something that tracks customer data and offers a glimpse into where our culture and politics are headed. That’s a pity. It turns out you can learn a lot from what people buy while they’re waiting for the cash register.

Not so long ago, Blue America was in a moment of peak merch. Partly it was a function of new technology: Direct-to-garment digital printing lets creators print shirts on demand, meaning they can respond to the news and not worry about having to warehouse the gear. It also was an accident of marketing: Progressive organizations popularized novelty gifts as a fundraising vehicle.

And it naturally owed a lot to our much-discussed national polarization: In Barrett’s surveys, one of the top reasons people gave for buying political sideline items was to bother specific family members.

But the boom was also a function of two people: Ginsburg and Donald Trump. The justice’s late-life emergence as a meme machine was irresistible for merch-makers and bag-buyers.

“Seven years ago, I heard the story about Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent collar,” said Nick Jehlen, who runs Resistance Pins, a top source of left-leaning novelties. “I knew an illustrator, made 100 of them, gave them to my friends. Someone said you should sell it.” His company was born. “That was pretty much our business for the first two and a half years.” Even today, RBG iconography, from shirts to Halloween costumes, is the most recognizable part of the national liberal gift market.

Trump, meanwhile, supercharged the liberal desire to advertise loyalties, spurring into being an entire resistance economy of clever (they hope) content creators who set out to turn the 45th president’s antagonists into real-time heroes. “We had a ‘Nevertheless She Persisted’ T-shirt for sale within 24 hours,” of the Senate silencing Warren over her speech against Trump’s attorney general nominee, said Draper.

Like any consumer trend, it wasn’t going to last forever. A few years back, “there were a lot of individuals you could make product for,” Draper told me. The fall-off “almost gets back to the mystery for Democrats” flummoxed by sagging poll numbers. “I think everything on the progressive side of things kind of peaked last summer with the overturning of Roe,” he said of the T-shirt market. “That was the last big thing. It had been one big run kind of starting with the Women’s March.”

Draper, whose Des Moines flagship store has the same status with campaign-season Democrats as Politics & Prose does with bookish Beltway-ites, told me he’s not too worried about the business implications of the resistance-merch dropoff. “We’ve always had these three pillars — funny, Midwestern, progressive,” he said. When the progressive stuff ebbs, the funny and Midwestern goods prop things up with KELCE/SWIFT ’24 and MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IS THE GAS STATION tees.

All the same, he makes a good case that people who care about politics ought to pay more attention to just whose tchotchkes are selling. “When people say, ‘Oh, who could be president other than Biden, I say, ‘Well, who would you buy on a T-shirt?’”

With fewer heroes, the goods that seem to be moving on the left this year are ones that poke fun at the right. Jehlen says big sellers this season include a pair of Trump-themed handcuffs, a “No one’s treading on you” flag, and a build-your-own-conspiracy-theory kit. “We saw a lot more sincere gifts” before, he said. “It was much more straightforward. You’d make a product that was saying what a person wants to show. Now it’s more clever. More jokes.” (He said a Katie Porter-themed whiteboard that he thought would be a top seller “sells fine, but hasn’t been a big hit.”)

Draper, for his part, says they’ve had good luck around themes like opposition to book bans (he was particularly keen on a shirt reading “FILTHY LIBERAL BOOK-HUGGER”). And he’s perpetually scanning the news for new opportunities. When we spoke late last month, a few days after the Senate hearing-room dust-up between Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin and Teamsters chief Sean O’Brien, he was pondering ways to make merch off of “STAND YOUR BUTT UP,” the awkward line Mullin used when he dared O’Brien to brawl.

“Our main rule, we’re content-based,” he said. “We sometimes go through slow news days, too. You can’t force anything. You have to go to where interest is. And right now, it’s less interest in the progressive stuff.”",political

"“We do not support calls for an immediate cease-fire,” Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood said Friday in New York. “This would only plant the seeds for the next war, because Hamas has no desire to see a durable peace, to see a two-state solution.”

Condemnation for the veto from human rights groups and NGOs was swift. Human Rights Watch said in a statement Friday that “[by] continuing to provide Israel with weapons & diplomatic cover as it commits atrocities, including collectively punishing the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, the US risks complicity in war crimes.”

Although the U.S. regularly uses its veto power to block resolutions that are critical of Israel and the Israeli government’s actions towards Palestinians, the Friday veto comes as the international community increasingly voices its concerns with Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Since Hamas mounted a deadly surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the U.S. has been Israel’s staunchest ally as it seeks to remove Hamas from the Gaza Strip, even as civilian casualties have mounted.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health has said Israeli airstrikes and operations have killed 17,000 Palestinians. Millions more are displaced.

The conflict has emerged as one of the biggest foreign policy challenges for the Biden administration, testing its support domestically among Muslim and Arab American voters and complicating its efforts in the Middle East to shore up relations with key allies and further normalization of diplomatic ties between the Arab world and Israel.",political
"It was November 2022 and the Qatar football World Cup was about to begin. The Gulf state was facing intense scrutiny from around the globe over its handling of the tournament, especially in light of criticism over its record on human rights.

In Brussels, the vice president of the European Parliament, Eva Kaili, was trying hard to help Qatar win friends in the West.

A matter of days later, on December 9, she was among the suspects arrested and later handed preliminary charges in connection with the biggest corruption scandal to hit the EU institutions in decades.

Kaili denies the allegations that she was part of a plot to take money and gifts in exchange for doing the bidding of Qatar and other foreign governments, and is fighting to clear her name.

Leaked documents from the so-called Qatargate investigation, seen by POLITICO, shed new light on her activities.

She told police after her arrest that she had merely wanted to “open a dialogue” between the EU and the Gulf state as she was very involved in “parliamentary diplomacy.”

She offered invitations to the World Cup to the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, the documents show.

“My dear President! Hope you are well. I have to pass you an invitation for the World Cup, you or your husband and boys might be interested,” Kaili wrote on November 12, according to WhatsApp messages included in the documents from the police investigation seen by POLITICO.

It isn’t clear where the invitation came from. Kaili deleted all of her subsequent 12 messages to Metsola in the exchange, except for one: “The rest I disagree too but I believe they will digest if we get the visa,” she writes, intriguingly.

It is not clear what this message refers to. What is known is that Qatar had been negotiating a visa-free travel deal with the EU and securing this agreement was one of Doha’s top priorities in Brussels, according to the leaked documents seen by POLITICO.

The visa deal received a green light in the Parliament’s civil liberties committee in December 2022, but a final vote on the plan has been put on hold since the scandal erupted.

Kaili told the police that deleting her messages was nothing but her usual practice. A spokesperson for Metsola said the Parliament president did not read the messages before Kaili deleted them.

Kaili did not reply to a request for comment for this story. She has previously said she is innocent of the preliminary charges against her and has never received money from Qatar or other foreign governments as has been alleged. Kaili is fighting to clear her name and has launched a legal challenge against the so-called Qatargate investigation.

The spokesperson for Metsola said “she never responded to the informal message sent by Kaili” inviting her to the World Cup, as “any requests for her presence at official events should be sent to her via official channels.”

The spokesperson continued: “The President did not accept any tickets to the World Cup in Qatar. She is on record as having refused to travel to the Qatar World Cup due to concerns with human rights in Qatar.”

Kaili also offered World Cup invitations to Alessandro Chiocchetti, Metsola’s head of cabinet at the time. He wrote back two days after Kaili’s offer to the president. “For the World Cup it is unlikely that I can make it,” he said. “But I thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

A European Parliament spokesperson confirmed that Chiocchetti’s comment was “a courtesy reply declining an invitation to attend the World Cup.”

Qatar has not responded to POLITICO’s repeated requests for comment on the corruption allegations. The Qatari government has previously denied the claims.",political
"It is very hard to think of an automotive design in recent memory so testosterone-fueled, so overtly male as Tesla’s Cybertruck. British car designer Adrian Clarke has described the EV’s styling as a “low polygon joke,” one “that only exists in the fever dreams of Tesla fans.”

Indeed, on the initial reveal of the angular, sharp-edged, and aggressive Cybertruck concept, Paul Snyder, chair of the transportation design program at Detroit’s College for Creative Studies, was incredulous: “What is going on over there?”

Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, was, of course, unapologetic. “We want to be the leader in apocalypse technology,” he said in 2020 to Jay Leno. Clad head to toe in black, including black aviators, looking like a Matrix casting reject, he added that the truck bed was large enough to “mount a missile launcher.”

But Musk is not alone in preferring such a thunderously masculine automotive aesthetic. Tesla’s new flagship merely represents the current peak of male-oriented auto design. Shanghai-based electric carmaker HiPhi's A hypercar is right up there as well. So is Nissan’s preposterous Hyper Force concept, which debuted at the Japan Mobility Show in October and looks like it’s driven straight out of Death Race 2000.

But there is clearly a market for the Cybertruck (just 15 percent of preorders would equal the annual US truck sales of Toyota), and the auto industry, despite the disruptive arrival of electric powertrains and a near 50/50 split in men and women drivers in the US alone, is doggedly continuing to favor a male perspective on how cars look.

Rethink the Automobile

Legendary industrial designer Dieter Rams famously said, “Limit everything to the essential, but do not remove the poetry.” The quote is often evoked in conversations about design with a capital D. (What does it mean? When is it good? When is it in danger? Who gets to decide?) One of the biggest “capital D” design questions unfolding right now involves a complete rethink of the automobile.

The car was certainly the most prominent invention of the 20th century, but now the combustion engine is headed grumpily out the back door (with the German government demanding a synthetic fuel loophole) with the coming ban, while EV architectures knock on the front and uncool hydrogen cells hope to be let in as a plus-one.

Traditionally, internal combustion engines (ICE) are loud, complicated, and take up a lot of space in the car’s body. Electric vehicles require no ICE and no transmission tunnel, leaving room for a flat floor and a focus on aerodynamics. Many aspects of car design can change with the shift to EVs, from wheel overhangs, to the exterior shape, to visible air intakes, interior layouts, and then some.",technology
"BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday rejected his fiscally conservative coalition partners who are demanding cuts to social benefits, as the government tries to plug a €60 billion hole in its budget.

“For me, it is very clear: There will be no dismantling of the welfare state in a situation like this,” Scholz said at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) convention in Berlin, during an eagerly awaited speech after weeks of silence on the subject.

Scholz’s vow brought relief to his party colleagues, but poses a challenge to coalition partners from the Free Democratic Party, who have repeatedly called for the budget crisis to be resolved by cutting social benefits. Most recently, FDP deputy leader Johannes Vogel described the German welfare state as a “thicket” in an interview, which he said creates injustice, particularly in the area of family-related benefits.

But in a 45-minute speech, Scholz gave little insight into how the government would proceed. The budget crisis would be a “very difficult, but not unsolvable task,” he said.

Times are tough for Scholz.

On the two-year anniversary of his three-way so-called traffic light coalition taking office, Scholz received an unwelcome gift from pollsters: An approval rating of just 20 percent, the worst result ever recorded for a chancellor by Germany’s public television ARD.

The budget crisis, triggered by a bombshell ruling from the German Constitutional Court in November, has likely contributed to Scholz’s tanking ratings. The court ruled that a government plan to repurpose €60 billion left over from an emergency COVID-19 fund to finance the country’s green agenda was unconstitutional.

Scholz’s speech on Saturday, in which he also invoked Germany’s support for Ukraine as it fights against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, was received by almost five minutes of applause. He said nothing during the speech about a reform of the debt brake, which constitutionally limits Germany’s new borrowing.

On Friday, the SPD delegates approved a reform of the debt brake in order to extricate the government from the budget crisis, but such a reform would be a deeply controversial topic within the governing coalition.",political
"The house in New Jersey came with a menagerie of control panels. Pallid little rectangles with fuzzy LCD screens, of varying brands and designs. Some were decades old, and there were six of them in total, dotted around various rooms. Joe Truncale, a customer engineer at Google, remembers trying to get his head around the system when he moved in two years ago.

Each thermostat had a piece of paper sticky-taped to it, with a helpful scribble from the previous homeowner explaining how to operate the gadget. Not exactly an intuitive user experience. And it wasn’t economical, either. In one area the heating was running constantly. Truncale balked at the idea of trying to fine-tune each of the fiddly little thermostats. “That’s when I started to think … maybe I build my own,” he says.

So, in a quest for control, he ripped them all out. It wasn’t long until he had built a smartphone app and hooked up a device to his gas furnace that allowed him to control the delivery of hot water to his heaters remotely. Temperature sensors replaced the old thermostats. These tracked the temperature in various rooms and sent that data along wires running inside the walls back to a central hub. With some programming and scheduling, Truncale soon had a system that managed the heating more or less automatically.

He called it ThermOS and made the code open source. “It’s been going since February of 2021,” he says. “I haven’t touched it in over a year. I haven’t made a code change.”

Most people, no matter their skill set, know what it’s like to do battle with a heating system, to wrestle with a thermostat. But even if you don’t want to build your own, there are ways of mastering these gadgets. This is how to make your thermostat work for you—and not the other way round.

Hot Enough for You?

For many, the biggest decision is what room temperature to choose when you’re at home. Many people prefer warmth in excess of 70 degrees, but, unsurprisingly, the higher you go, the more money you’ll spend. The World Health Organization suggests 18 degrees Celsius (64 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit) as a minimum in temperate climates. “I did it myself,” says Jo Alsop, founder of the British independent advisory body The Heating Hub. “I got used to a house that was around 18 to 18.5 degrees [Celsius].”

Turning the room temperature down is one of the best ways of lowering your utility bill, suggests Katy King at Nesta, an innovation-focused charity in the UK. She and colleagues have compared the potential savings from turning your thermostat down by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (from approximately 68 to 66 degrees) with reducing the time you heat your home for by five hours every week. The 1.8-degree change could save £100 ($126) on an annual bill in the UK, she estimates, whereas reducing heating time only saves £12 across the year.

“It really surprised me when we did this research,” says King. “It’s heating to a higher temperature that really makes a bigger difference.”",technology
"The ruling reinstates restrictions, imposed in October by U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan but suspended amid the appeal, on Trump’s ability to attack key witnesses in the case against him. Trump is also barred from attacking prosecutors in the case — other than special counsel Jack Smith — and courthouse staff, if the statements are deemed to be an effort to interfere in the proceedings.

The provisions, however, represent a notable narrowing of Chutkan’s original gag order, which the appeals court said “sweeps too broadly.” The panel ruled that Trump remains entitled to criticize various figures who played a role in the 2020 election saga as long as he does not zero in on their potential testimony at the trial, scheduled to begin March 4.

The ruling is the second time in recent days that appellate courts have upheld gag orders against Trump: Last week, a New York appeals court reinstated a more limited gag in his New York civil fraud case. The D.C. Circuit panel, however, is the first appellate court to provide extensive justification for restricting the speech of the likely GOP nominee for president.

Shortly after the D.C. Circuit ruling, Trump said on social media that he will appeal. He can appeal either to the full bench of the appeals court or to the Supreme Court. The outcome of that fight could bear heavily on the 2024 presidential campaign, where Trump has attempted to make his defense against the criminal cases a centerpiece of his message.

“President Trump will continue to fight for the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans to hear from the leading presidential candidate at the height of his campaign,” said Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung, noting that the judges on the panel are all Democratic appointees. In addition to Millett, an Obama appointee, the panel included Obama appointee Cornelia Pillard and Biden appointee Bradley Garcia.

A spokesperson for the special counsel’s office declined to comment.

Notably, the D.C. Circuit panel took aim at some of Trump’s most explosive arguments and campaign trail talking points. For example, the judges rejected Trump’s argument that courts should simply postpone his trial until after the election in order to avoid the First Amendment issues raised by the gag order. The panel concluded that delaying the trial would “compound” threats to the process rather than alleviate them.

“Postponing trial would incentivize criminal defendants to engage in harmful speech as a means of delaying their prosecution,” Millett wrote. “A criminal defendant cannot use significantly and imminently harmful speech to override the district court’s control and management of the trial schedule.”

Similarly, the court dismissed Trump’s concerns that the gag order would stifle his political speech at the height of his presidential candidacy.

“The existence of a political campaign or political speech does not alter the court’s historical commitment or obligation to ensure the fair administration of justice in criminal cases,” the panel concluded. “A trial participant’s engagement in political speech cannot degrade or diminish that essential judicial function. … He cannot evade that legitimate limitation by dressing up messages to witnesses in political-speech garb.”

The court took particular issue with Trump’s contention that his social media messages mentioning potential trial witnesses — like former chief of staff Mark Meadows and retired Gen. Mark Milley — were political speech protected by the First Amendment.

“The district court had the authority to prevent Mr. Trump from laundering communications concerning witnesses … through social media postings or other public comments,” the panel concluded.

The panel also found that individuals who are the targets of Trump’s vitriol often suffer threats and harassment from others. The court cited numerous examples of witnesses who have complained of fear and danger after Trump targeted them with comments or social media posts.

“It is the court’s duty and authority to prevent speech by trial participants, including the defendant, when the record shows that their words have an ‘extraordinary power to undermine or destroy the efficacy of the criminal justice system,’” Millett wrote, quoting a 1991 Supreme Court case detailing the government’s right to regulate speech by attorneys.

The judges cited Trump’s targeting of a judge and his law clerk in New York, where his business empire is in the midst of a civil trial alleging fraudulent practices — attacks that resulted in significant threats. They also cited threats faced by two Georgia election workers falsely accused by Trump and other allies of manipulating ballots in 2020.

“Mr. Trump himself recognizes the power of his words and their effect on his audience, agreeing that his supporters ‘listen to [him] like no one else,’” the judges noted.

The panel rejected arguments from Trump’s lawyers that reining in his speech because of how some of his followers may react to it amounted to a “heckler’s veto” that courts have traditionally said isn’t a good enough reason to restrict First Amendment rights.

“Within a judicial proceeding, a trial court’s duty to protect the functioning of the criminal trial process is not cabined by the incitement doctrine,” Millett wrote.

While the appeals court pared back some of the limits Chutkan put on Trump’s public statements about court staff and faulted her for vague language in her initial order, Millett said Chutkan has the power to rein in speech by trial participants in order to maintain the integrity of the process.

“Just as a court is duty-bound to prevent a trial from devolving into a carnival … so too can it prevent trial participants and staff from having to operate under siege,” Millett wrote.",political
"On March 1, 2020—11 days before the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and the scope of human intimacy shrank to the size of a touchscreen—Sharmistha Dubey became the chief executive of the largest internet dating company on the planet. Dubey had spent years climbing through the C-suites at Match Group, where the conference rooms are named after love songs and one of the walls is covered in wedding announcements. Now she had control of a $20 billion empire. Some of the most profitable brands in the business, including Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, and Match, were hers to command, as were the love lives of tens of millions of people.

May 2021. Subscribe to WIRED. Photograph: ARTURO OLMOS

The previous CEO, Mandy Ginsberg, had left Match Group to attend to health issues and to rebuild her house, which had been leveled by a tornado. Before she handed the tiller to Dubey, she sketched out a course for the coming months. There would be an international growth plan for OkCupid, which had just exploded in India; a push into the matrimonial market in Japan with an app called Pairs Engage; an investment in an Egyptian dating startup; and new paid features for Tinder, the company’s golden goose. “I’m confident we won’t miss a beat during this transition,” Ginsberg had assured shareholders. Match Group would be safe in Shar Dubey’s hands.

And then, to put things mildly, IRL courtship suddenly became about as appealing as kissing a used Kleenex. (Appropriately, the scientific term for used tissues and other infectious objects is fomite, which comes from the Latin word for “tinder.”) Dubey started getting calls: How does one date in a pandemic? Users wanted the answer, but so did shareholders. Match Group earns 97 percent of its revenue from subscriptions and other paid features. “If we’re expecting 10,000 new subscribers, and we see 6,000—and we see that for two, three, four days—you start to realize you have a pretty big problem,” Gary Swidler, Match Group’s CFO and COO, recalls. “And then the question turns to Shar: ‘What do you want to do?’”

Dubey, who is 50, has apple cheeks and sloped eyebrows that give her a fixed expression of sympathetic concern. Where Ginsberg was an effusive, emotive leader, readily sharing stories about her own romantic life, Dubey comes across as stoic in matters of love, even detached. “I’m a technologist,” she says. “I may not sound warm and fuzzy.” Yet her theories of partnership have shaped the past decade of online dating and earned her a reputation as a product genius. “She’s a little bit of an oracle,” Ginsberg says. If love is the product of choice and happenstance, Dubey has an instinct for how technology can amplify both.

Before she made any decisions about Match Group’s Covid-19 trajectory, Dubey asked for data on users’ behavior, particularly in Asia, where the virus hit first. The numbers showed something strange. In early March, activity had dipped across the company’s brands. But by the end of the month it had shot back up, way higher than before. On March 29, Tinder users swiped through more than 3 billion potential matches, a one-day record for the app. (The record has since been broken 130 times.) Across Match Group’s portfolio, daily messages went up by 27 percent. Young women were engaging more than they ever had before, by just about every metric (minutes spent, messages sent, matches made). First-time subscriptions had rebounded too, up 15 percent over the previous year. People weren’t patiently waiting for the world to reopen. They were dating like it was the end of the world.

“We didn’t know where this was going,” Dubey says. She had never run a multibillion-dollar company before. She had never lived through a pandemic. She had never even been on an online date. But her instincts had helped Match Group grow from a collection of desktop sites into a horizontally integrated marketplace for every conceivable type of lonely heart, from the Gen Z swiper to the boomer divorcé. And those instincts—what Dubey calls “subconscious patterns of data”—were telling her something that she wasn’t quite ready to share publicly: The coronavirus wouldn’t destroy online dating. It would reinvent it.",technology

Like, we're gonna play that song live,

it's one of my favorite one, too.

So I think that it's really great

and yeah, I really love THE LONELIEST,

for sure. [smacks lips]

Oh, this is hard, bro.

I'm scared, you guys.

This one is spicy.

Thomas Raggi, cobra. This one is spicy.

Okay, like this...

Cobra.

I mean, 'cause it was like a nickname

that I had during the X Factor period.

This nickname- And it means like,

yeah, the cobra snake.

But the reality is because

he has a cobra somewhere, you know?

You can guess. You guys can guess,

why they call him that [imitates snake hiss].

Thomas Raggi...

Oh my god. Personality type.

Nobody thinks you're stylish, but they like

your personality. No style, see?

They like your personality.

It's better, no? You're a Capricorn.

That's already enough.

It's even better for sure.

Absolutely.

So, what's your personality type?

Maybe, I'm funny, I will say.

I agree.

I'm good. I look great. I'm blonde.

You're blonde. I play guitar.

I'm cool, guys.

Okay, last board, Maneskin.

Where does Maneskin live?

We'll never tell you.

In Rome. 'Cause it's the best city

in the world. Exactly.

We still live in Rome because we genuinely think

it's the best city in the world.

They've been trying to make us move many times.

Yeah, first they tried to have us move to Milan.

And we were like, No way.

And then they tried to make us move

to L.A. and we were like, No way.

But now we're like, Eh, maybe three months a year.

What Maneskin song are you?

Oh my god, guys, we have to take this quiz.

Ah, this is a quiz.

Yeah, it's a quiz. Oh, okay.

But which song do you think you are?

I think Zitti e buoni.

I think Kool Kids 'cause I'm cool.

[band members laugh]

THE LONELIEST 'cause I'm sad.

What are you?

I Wanna be Your Slave.

'Cause he's a slut. [laughs]

[Victoria] What are Maneskin concerts like?

Hot people moving.

Why was Maneskin censored?

Good question. Why was Maneskin censor?

Why? We ask ourselves.

We asked that question to the production.

Why was Maneskin censored?

Well-

The can handle, we're too hot.

Okay, why are Maneskin so popular?

You made us. [Victoria laughs]

You tell us. Yeah, you tell us exactly.

Okay, last question.

Why is Maneskin hated? Hated.

Good question! We ask to you,

why is Maneskin hated?

Maybe it's the reason why we got censored.

So it's a dog that bites his own tail.

I toss it!

Goodbye, thank you.

That was a bit off. [Damiano laughs]

That was our last board.

Thank you so much. Thank you so much

for watching it. [Victoria claps]

"Also at Stanford was New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. He told me he would back a Trump challenger in the next couple of weeks, but that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds didn’t give him a head’s up on her endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and that he found her timing odd. (He was being polite: Sununu has privately been even more critical of Reynolds’ decision, I’m told.)

Sununu is widely expected to back Nikki Haley. But for all the movement toward Haley in recent weeks, it remains to be seen whether she has the political dexterity and bigness of spirit to forge the disparate coalition needed to even threaten Trump.

Speaking of being polite, I’ll get to the point. She’s yet to call her former South Carolina rival, Sen. Tim Scott, or approach Chris Christie, people familiar with the situation tell me. If Haley is serious about thwarting Trump, she needs to win the backing of her opponents and that means setting aside her resentment toward Scott — a perfunctory text isn’t sufficient — and having a serious conversation with Christie before they fracture the anti-Trump vote in New Hampshire.

In isolation, none of these events are hugely significant. Yet taken together, they illustrate why, as 2023 nears its close, the former president is poised to roll to the Republican nomination and could win back the White House. The Stop Trump effort has been abysmal.

He may never have been beatable. For all the obsessive coverage about who wealthy GOP donors fancy, it’s Republican primary voters without college degrees who are the defining bloc in this race. Trump’s enduring grip on them is why he’ll be so hard to defeat and why GOP leaders are so reluctant to cross him.

However, if one was to take brush to canvas for that impressionistic portrayal of how he did it, it would include the following.

The senior officials who worked in Trump’s administration would mute themselves, disagree on whether to go public with their fears about a restoration or just not work in the coordinated, strategic and relentless fashion that’s needed to get through to voters. (With apologies to John Kelly, a former general officer who is willing to speak out, a single and solo statement isn’t enough.)

Republican officials who have little appetite for Trump’s return would stay mum and enable Trump’s comeback, each of them finding a rationale for their silence, some more compelling than others.

Those GOP lawmakers who did step up to try to block Trump’s path wouldn’t coordinate their efforts, would disagree on who the best alternative is and thereby muddy their effort and undermine their mission.

And the lackluster field would, in the last full measure of their timidity, prove unable to rally to a single alternative because they were unwilling to summon the capaciousness necessary for the cause of stopping Trump.

Oh, and Trump’s top alternatives would bicker with one another in most every debate and spend their negative advertising dollars on attacking one another rather than on targeting the former president.

Disagree if you want, but, as the kids say, where’s the lie?

It’s just under a month until the Iowa caucuses and there’s a striking lack of urgency among Republicans who do not want to see Trump renominated. There’s resignation, rationalization, despair and even denial. Yet there’s little action.

Well, except for the capitulation from those who have misgivings about Trump but want to avoid the hassle of being pushed by his lieutenants, pressed by conservative media and harangued at their Lincoln Day dinners. A frustrated Sununu told me he knows even some of the governors “that are supporting [Trump] don’t want him to be the nominee.” To borrow a memorable line from Bill Clinton, these Republicans want to maintain their viability within the system.

But it’s the quiet from so many of the party’s lawmakers, former candidates and biggest names that’s most revealing.

It was easy to glimpse the future from George Stephanopoulos’ interview on ABC’s “This Week” with Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who repeatedly dodged questions about whether he’d back Trump by deferring to GOP primary voters.

Republicans like Lankford are plainly unenthusiastic about Trump but will avoid weighing in on the primary and then when he wins the nomination offer some version of saying they’ll support the party’s nominee because that’s who the voters selected. Then, should Trump be found guilty of crimes, the same Republicans will be asked if they still support the nominee now that said standard-bearer is a felon. Then the same question will be asked again if and when he’s sentenced to prison.

It will be a slow-rolling, Access Hollywood-style mess, pitting party leaders against their electoral base. Except this time it will be utterly predictable.

Unlike in 2016, however, those who feel strongest about the risk Trump poses may have the least ability to stop him. It’s a depressing indication of our polarized times that Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) could only hurt DeSantis, Haley and Christie by publicly rallying to their side.

“If virtually all the GOP governors and senators were to say they would not support Trump, even in the general, I don’t think his poll numbers would be harmed, at all,” Romney told me. “They might even get better. I think the MAGA base dislikes our elected elites as much or more than they dislike Democrats.”

Before you write off Romney as hopelessly embittered, convinced his own party is beyond redemption, take note that he’s not fully convinced Trump is inevitable.

“Haley has a shot,” he said. “A long one.”

But if she or any other Trump alternative has a shot, I wondered in my conversation with Sununu, where’s the movement?

He conceded it was “delayed” but insisted there was time yet. More endorsements would mean more coverage which would beget more endorsements and then strong showings in early states.

“And I think when these dominoes start to go — that’s why I’m still very much a believer that Trump very well could lose New Hampshire — because I do see how the dominoes go and when they go they go fast,” he said. Then Sununu made like a machine gun staccato and sounded out dominoes falling: “Duh-duh-duh-duh.”

Utah’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, also embracing the glass-is-half-full perspective, pointed out how many candidates have already dropped out.

“There does seem to be a consolidation happening more naturally than even before,” Cox told me. “It’s kind of a two-person race for that second spot.” And it happened “before we got a heavy hand pushing it,” he added.

The key, Cox said, will be Trump’s margins in the initial states. “Is there any vulnerability at all, is it close? Is it within 10 points?”

There is a model for how Trump could be toppled. It’s the way Biden claimed the Democratic nomination in 2020. The moment he won the South Carolina primary it sent an immediate message to Democrats hungry for a candidate who could defeat Trump (sound familiar?) that Biden was their man. With endorsements from his former foes and other party leaders, Biden rolled into Super Tuesday three days later with unstoppable momentum.

That said, there are some, well, very significant differences between then and now. For starters, today’s Democrats are a much more establishment-oriented party than today’s splintered GOP. What happened with Democrats in 2020 is how Republican primaries used to go. Further, Donald Trump is a far more formidable candidate than Bernie Sanders, whom Biden had to overcome.

Just as significant, Trump has a structural advantage this year because his lieutenants worked to frontload the primary calendar and pushed states toward winner-take-all delegate allocations. For all his unpredictable and impulsive tendencies, the former president trusted a trio of aides — Chris LaCivita, Susie Wiles and Brian Jack — to leverage his grassroots strength and reshape the nominating contest in a way that was anything but improvisational.

Which is why, for all of Sununu’s optimism about dominoes falling, some Republicans increasingly believe the only way to keep Trump from the nomination is for him to be convicted of felonies before next summer’s nominating convention

“Are we really going to bring this race down and out before Super Tuesday, when the guy goes on trial,” Christie told me, alluding to the March 4 start of Trump’s case on Jan. 6-related charges in Washington. “That’s why I’m sitting here saying: I’m in through the convention. It’s not that I’m delusional, it’s that nobody else is paying attention to what’s really happening.”

What’s happening, Christie explained, is that the judge presiding over Trump’s case in Washington has given no indication she’ll push back the trial and that former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows has signed an immunity deal with federal prosecutors to avoid charges in exchange for testifying that the former president committed crimes.

Christie isn’t the only person eying the potential March convergence of Trump’s trial and his effectively wrapping up the Republican nomination. No Labels chief Nancy Jacobson last week reached out to influential party figures to ask them if Haley could be persuaded to run on the third-party group’s line if and when Trump drives her out of the GOP primary, a person familiar with her told me.

Haley, still eying a future in Republican politics, has little interest in such a mission. In fact, she’s already planning for a showdown with Trump in South Carolina. Her campaign is planning a multi-city fundraising tour of California in February, by when, they assume, she’ll be in a head-to-head finale of sorts and can vacuum all the anti-Trump dollars out west.

For now, though, much of the party’s leadership class is falling in line with Trump or staying on the sidelines. Look no further than the sound of silence coming out of the winter meeting this week of the Republican Governors Association, a group that once rallied to their own (see George W. Bush in 2000) but is now divided. Reynolds, the group’s chair, is for DeSantis, other governors have backed Trump and others still are hanging back to see if Haley can emerge after the first two states.

Back at Stanford, former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who lost her seat in the 2018 suburban wave against Trump, said she had seen this movie before.

“Just like in ‘16, all these guys came around too late,” Comstock grumbled. “Like this should’ve been done six months ago. You didn’t know Trump was a threat? You didn’t know he was leading?”

"Select Android phones will be receiving a literal life-saving update allowing users to instantly share critical medical information with first responders.

The feature will be available on the Personal Safety app, and the way it works, according to developer RapidSOS, is the software will send over the information whenever a call is placed to a “supported emergency number – like 911.” Or if they prefer, people can choose to send everything via text message. What that batch of data houses is totally up to you, but it can include your name, allergies that you have, pre-existing conditions, emergency contacts, what kind of medication you’re on, and more.

Everything listed out will be seen by first responders, and you’ll know what’s being shared as it will all appear on the app alongside other important information. If any of this sounds familiar, that’s because iPhones have something very similar called Medical ID. It was even made by the same company: RapidSOS.

To activate this feature, launch Personal Safety, go to Your info, enter Emergency info access, then toggle Share during emergency call.

Various limitations

As great as this update may be, there are several limitations.

First off, it looks like this will only be available in certain regions in the United States. The announcement doesn’t mention any other emergency contact number besides 911. We couldn’t find a full list of supporting locations although the post does hint at Baltimore, Maryland as one of the cities.

Second, Personal Safety is not a widespread app. It’s currently exclusive to the Nothing Phone 1 as well as the entire Google Pixel lineup. Do note that Pixel 4a and later models automatically come with the software (older devices will have to manually download it). It's important to mention that the Pixel Watch has Personal Safety, but may not be included in the rollout. It seems the patch is purely for smartphones. Also, those phones must be running Android 12 or above.

We tried reaching RapidSOS to ask which US regions will support the data sharing and if it intends to roll out the feature to other countries. This tech runs on Android’s Emergency Location Service which exists in other global regions. However, the company doesn’t seem to have a straightforward way for members of the press to contact them. So, we sent our query over to Google. Hopefully, they’ll be able to shed some light soon.

Until then, check out TechRadar’s list of the best Pixel phones for 2023.

Update 12-8-2023 5:15 PM: A Google representative got back to us with more information, and as it turns out, the feature's availability is contingent on outside factors. They explain that ""users in any country can [technically] enter this information"" and send it out to emergency services, but it depends on whether or not a country's network supports Android's Emergency Location Service.

Similarly, the Personal Safety upgrade can be used throughout the US. However, it depends on if ""911/112 call centers and cellular networks"" decide to actively support the feature. The same goes for other phones. It's up to third-party manufacturers to decide if they want the app on their hardware. It's out of the hands of both Google and RapidSOS.",technology
"Samsung looks set to reveal its Samsung Galaxy S24 phones in January 2024, with a standard-sized Galaxy S24, a larger Galaxy S24 Plus and an uber-premium Galaxy S24 Ultra expected to succeed the company’s excellent Samsung Galaxy S23 line.

You can bet your bottom dollar that all three devices will rank among the best Samsung phones ever made – perhaps even the best phones – and, if rumors are to be believed, the standard Galaxy S24 could have a fair few features in common with Apple’s latest standard model, the iPhone 15.

In this guide, then, we compare everything we know about the iPhone 15 against what we think we already know about the as-yet-unreleased Samsung Galaxy S24. Naturally, we’ll be updating the below information with confirmed details as and when the latter phone is released.

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Specs comparison

Here’s an at-a-glance look at the key specs boasted by the iPhone 15, and the rumored key specs of the Samsung Galaxy S24.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Specs iPhone 15 Samsung Galaxy S24 (rumored) Dimensions: 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.80 mm N/A Weight: 171g N/A Display: 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED Resolution: 2556 x 1179 pixels 2340 x 1080 pixels Refresh rate: 60Hz 40Hz-100Hz variable Chipset: A16 Bionic Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Exynos 2400 Rear cameras: 48MP main (24mm, ƒ/1.78), 12MP ultra-wide (13mm, ƒ/2.2) 50MP main (24mm, ƒ/1.8), 12MP ultra-wide (13mm, ƒ/2.2), 10MP telephoto (70mm, ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 12MP 12MP RAM: 6GB 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB 128GB, 256GB

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Price and availability

The iPhone 15 series launched in September 2023 (Image credit: Apple)

The iPhone 15 was officially unveiled on September 12, 2023, and went on sale on September 15 for the following prices: $799 / £799 / AU$1,499 for the 128GB model, $899 / £899 / AU$1,699 for the 256GB option, and $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$2,049 for the 512GB model.

Samsung hasn’t yet confirmed a launch date for – nor even the existence of – the Samsung Galaxy S24, but rumors point towards a January 2024 arrival. Tipsters have touted January 17 as the phone’s official launch date, with pre-orders expected to begin on January 18, though we’d still take these rumors with a pinch of salt for now.

We haven't heard much about Galaxy S24 pricing, but one rumor hints that Samsung’s upcoming vanilla model will cost the same as the Galaxy S23. So $799.99 / £849 / AU$1,349 for the model with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, and $859.99 / £899 / AU$1,449 for the 256GB storage variant. In other words, we expect Galaxy S24 pricing to be comparable with iPhone 15 pricing.

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Design and display

Image 1 of 3 The iPhone 15 display (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff) The iPhone 15 rear panel (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff) The iPhone 15 side profile (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

On the design front, the iPhone 15 looks a lot like Apple’s recent iPhones, with the exception of its slightly curved edges and color-infused rear glass panel. It measures 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm, weighs 171g and comes in either black, blue, green, yellow or pink. There’s an IP68 rating, too, meaning it’s dust-proof and water-resistant, and the iPhone 15 also marks the first Apple smartphone to ship with a USB-C port instead of the company’s proprietary Lightning port.

The iPhone 15 boasts an excellent 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display (which has a 2556 x 1179 pixel resolution), though its refresh rate is limited to a static 60Hz. The phone does, however, sport Apple’s Dynamic Island – first introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max – which gives its display a more premium feel, as well as enhanced functionality.

The design and display credentials of the Samsung Galaxy S24 are harder to pin down, but we’ve got a general idea of what to expect come January. Several leaks have pointed towards subtle design changes for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, with both phones reportedly in line for smaller bezels and slightly larger screens than their respective Galaxy S23 predecessors. They’re rumored to be getting slightly flatter edges, too, following the lead of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro.

An unofficial render of the Samsung Galaxy S24 (Image credit: @OnLeaks / SmartPrix)

A Galaxy S24 render leak (above) has further corroborated these rumors, so we’re expecting Samsung’s next standard model to look more iPhone-like than any Galaxy phone that’s come before it (or did Apple make its iPhone more Samsung-like?). Incidentally, the most recent Galaxy S24 specs leak hints at a 6.2-inch display, which would be 0.1 inches larger than the iPhone 15’s equivalent screen.

On that front, unless Samsung rocks the boat, we’d expect the Galaxy S24 to stick with the S23’s 120Hz AMOLED display (with 2340 x 1080 pixels) and variable 48Hz to 120Hz refresh rate. Again, that would trump the iPhone 15’s static 60Hz refresh rate.

As for Samsung Galaxy S24 colors, we’re expecting the options to be Onyx Black, Marble Grey, Cobalt Violet and Amber Yellow.

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Cameras

The iPhone 15's rear array (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

The iPhone 15 has a two-camera rear setup comprising a 48MP main lens (f/1.6) and a 12MP ultra-wide lens (f/2.4). On the front, there’s a single TrueDepth 12MP lens (f/1.9).

As noted in our iPhone 15 review, this does not count the 2x optical zoom that’s actually part of the 48MP lens. The iPhone 15 takes the middle 12 pixels of the full frame to deliver an optically zoomed-in image. This is more useful than it sounds, as it's a great way of getting closer to the action without moving closer and, unlike digitally zoomed photos, the quality of these 12MP images is, essentially, optical quality. It's really just a smart live crop.

Samsung Galaxy S23 camera array (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

The Samsung Galaxy S23, by contrast, features a full-blown 10MP telephoto camera (with 3x optical zoom), and the Galaxy S24 is expected to retain this lens, as well as its predecessor’s 50MP wide lens (24mm, ƒ/1.8) and 12MP ultra-wide lens (13mm, ƒ/2.2). Rumors suggest that the Galaxy S24’s three rear cameras will be arranged in exactly the same way as they are on the Galaxy S23, too, so if you’re keen to get an insight into the upcoming phone’s photography capabilities, check out our Samsung Galaxy S23 review.

When it comes to the selfie camera, it looks like there won't be any change: we'll get a 12MP camera again, and no under-display technology.

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Performance

Apple’s iPhone 15 is powered by what was, for us, 2022’s best mobile chipset, the A16 Bionic, which features a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural engine, all backed by 6GB of RAM. Suffice to say, the iPhone 15 is a super speedy smartphone, and although the A16 Bionic isn’t as fast as the new A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, it provides more than enough power for everyday mobile-centric tasks, as well as light gaming.

Playing Asphalt 9: Legends on the iPhone 15 (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

To get more granular, in our testing, the iPhone 15's A16 Bionic essentially matched the numbers of the same chipset found in the iPhone 14 Pro. The A16 Bionic also bests Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which is the chipset powering the Samsung Galaxy S23.

As for the Galaxy S24, we’re expecting the phone to ship with Qualcomm’s brand new (and even more powerful) Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. However, we’re fairly certain that Samsung’s chipset offering won’t be consistent across the Galaxy S24 range. While every Galaxy S24 Ultra model, regardless of region, is tipped to use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, rumors suggest that certain standard Galaxy S23 models – presumably those sold in Europe – will be fitted with Samsung’s own Exynos 2400 chips. This was the case for the Galaxy S22 range.

Though undeniably powerful, Samsung’s Exynos chipsets are known for being weaker than their Qualcomm counterparts, meaning those in affected regions may have to settle for a slightly less powerful version of the Galaxy S24 come January. We don’t yet know how significant these differences could prove to be, but we still think it’s safe to expect performance improvements across the board for all Galaxy S24 models (indeed, a leaked Geekbench listing teases Galaxy S23-beating benchmark scores for Samsung’s next phone).

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Battery life

The iPhone 15 lasted just over 15 hours in our testing (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)

Apple never discloses the official battery capacities of its iPhones, but we’re pretty certain that the iPhone 15 is powered by a 3,349mAh cell. In testing, we found that the device lasted a full day when used casually (though 'full day' in this instance does not mean 24 hours – more like 15 hours).

On the charging front, you’re able to charge the iPhone 15 to 50% in 30 minutes (i.e. the same as the iPhone 14), and the phone offers the same 15W and 7.5W wireless charging speeds for MagSafe and the Qi-standard, respectively, as its predecessor.

For the Samsung Galaxy S24, some rumors have hinted that its battery might see improvements over the Galaxy S23, with one report claiming that Samsung is working on an electric-vehicle style battery for smartphones. This would use a stacked rather than rolled design, allowing for 10% greater capacity in the same space. However, it’s not clear whether this new tech will be ready in time for the Galaxy S24 (honestly, we’re not hopeful).

As for the phone’s battery capacity, we’re hearing that the Galaxy S24 will use a 4,000mAh battery, which would be 100mAh bigger than its predecessor’s cell. In our testing, the latter ran for just over 10 hours in Adaptive refresh rate mode, and just over 11 hours at 60Hz, so it’d be reasonable to expect marginal battery life improvements from the Galaxy S24.

Once again, though, it looks like Samsung’s next standard model will be limited to 25W charging, with faster charging reserved for the larger Plus and Ultra models.

Samsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Verdict

(Image credit: Future)

So, if you’re in the market for a new smartphone, should you go for the iPhone 15 or Samsung Galaxy S24? Well, for obvious reasons, we can’t give you a definitive answer to that question just yet – we’ll be updating this section when the Galaxy S24 is officially announced next year – but we can draw some early conclusions based on the rumors we’ve outlined above.

As usual, the biggest differentiator between these two phones is going to be the software they run. If you’re already embedded in, or a fan of, Apple’s iOS operating system, then the iPhone 15 is the natural choice. Similarly, if you’re an Android loyalist, then the Galaxy S24 will almost certainly meet your expectations.

But what if you’re brand agnostic, or someone who’s keen to change from one operating system to the other? Well, there are almost certainly going to be a few key differences between these two phones, but by and large, the iPhone 15 and Galaxy S24 will be very similar smartphones.

Judging by what we’ve heard so far, the Galaxy S24 will cost pretty much the same amount as the iPhone 15, and it’ll look fairly similar, too (at least, as Androids and iPhones go). Both phones are also likely to be comparable in speed and performance.

The Galaxy S24, however, is sure to benefit from a variable refresh rate (which the iPhone 15 doesn’t have), as well as slightly better cameras (you’ll get a whole telephoto lens with the Samsung phone). The iPhone 15, on the other hand, will probably have slightly better battery life, if we compare our current iPhone 15 findings with what we’ve heard about the Galaxy S24 on that front.

Ultimately, then, it’ll be up to you to figure out what you're looking for in a smartphone, and what features you’re willing to compromise on (or forgo entirely).",technology
"It wouldn’t be a Game Awards without Hideo Kojima. This time, however, the director wasn’t on hand to show off Death Stranding 2 — instead he revealed a new Xbox game called OD. We didn’t get to see much of the game, which was teased last year, and the first teaser mostly just showed the cast doing motion capture tests. It ended with the tagline “For all the players and screamers.”

That said, the game does have a strong cast, including Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier. Also Jordan Peele is involved somehow. Kojima teased other big names who are working on the project, but wouldn’t say who just yet. OD is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a press release describing it as an experience that “explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear — while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film.”

In a statement, Kojima said “We are working with Xbox Game Studios and their cloud gaming technology to take on the challenge of creating a very unique, immersive, and totally new style of game — or rather, a new form of media.”",technology
"Joel Dietz says crypto is rotten, and he’s going to court to try to prove it. Dietz is a self-described “founding member” of Ethereum, the computer network on which the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is housed. He didn’t pen the code, but in 2014, before Ethereum had launched, he worked as an evangelist of sorts, “showing people how it worked and why it was important,” Dietz says. He received a batch of cryptocurrency in return.

In the early days, working in crypto felt like “building the future of the internet,” says Dietz. It was about transparency, egalitarianism, and decentralization (crypto shorthand for transferring control over apps and infrastructure from the few to the many.) Dietz believed that open source—the practice of making software code available for anyone to see, use, and riff upon—could usher in this new dawn. “But things have gone offtrack from the original vision,” he says. “There’s a rotting body here, and it smells.”

In a state court in California, Dietz is suing former collaborator Aaron Davis for allegedly swindling him out of an ownership stake in MetaMask, an Ethereum-based crypto wallet, as part of the kind of “seedy backroom deal,” says Dietz, that has become “endemic” in crypto. Named as codefendants are Dan Finlay, with whom Davis publicly partnered on MetaMask; Consensys, the software company that owns the wallet; and Joe Lubin, Ethereum cofounder and Consensys CEO.

In a statement given to WIRED, Finlay dismissed the lawsuit as “baseless.” Dietz has been “falsely marketing himself” as a founder to garner the respect of prospective investors, he said, but “has no relation to MetaMask or any of its technology.”

Dietz is certainly after financial compensation. In March of 2022, Consensys was valued at $7 billion, and MetaMask is among its most successful products. But, Dietz claims, the lawsuit is a small way of drawing attention to the state of crypto, which has been blighted by a series of legal battles, many of which boil down to an abuse of power or position. US regulators have filed civil charges against the world’s largest crypto exchanges—among them Binance, Coinbase, and Gemini—which are alleged to have either misled, mistreated, or endangered crypto investors. In July, Alex Mashinsky, founder of crypto lender Celsius, was charged by the US Department of Justice with “orchestrating a scheme to defraud customers.” Earlier this month, Sam Bankman-Fried, once the golden boy of crypto, was found guilty of overseeing a multibillion-dollar fraud at his FTX exchange. In these cases, decentralization was a mirage.

“The industry needs cleaning up,” Dietz says. “It’s embarrassing.”",technology
"I’m a woman of peace, but I’m prepared to bare-knuckle fight you for Yamaha’s new 5-disc CD changer in the new year if Santa doesn't get this memo by Christmas.

That's right, the CD changer has risen from my 2002 house party photos (kept in a box under my bed) and into present day, thanks to the just-unveiled Yamaha CD-C603.

This time around, not only does the disc tray open fully to reveal every CD within its wheel, like a glorious audio quesadilla buffet (thus allowing you to admire and switch out all five discs simultaneously), but you get something Yamaha is calling Play X Change. This allows you to change CDs while another is playing.

It's further proof that despite the continued popularity of the best music streaming services, the dedicated tower CD player is once again making a bid for your living room – just see the high-end Hegel Viking or Arcam's new CD5 (part of a quintet of hi-fi launches), both of which arrived in October this year.

And thanks to Yamaha staples such as Pure Direct (which shuts down the digital audio output and turns off the display, thereby reducing noise), the ‘Laser Pickup Floating Mechanism’ tech more commonly found in single-disc players (to reduce vibrational issues with the physical format), and ‘Intelligent Digital Servo’, which is basically digital processing designed to detect and atone for any tracking or motor speed issues, I think it's a winning proposition.

The only downside I see? No, I'm not worried about the wheel mechanism impacting sound quality. I'm somewhat disappointed to see that disc compatibility is limited to CD, CD-R, and CD-RW. So it won't play my SACDs – and if you don't own a stack of those next to the aforementioned photos under your bed, why not check out them out among the six fantastic tech failures whose ghosts still haunt me today?

Opinion: I have a huge collection of CDs – let's party!

Even this image reminds me of 1990s hi-fi ads – and I love it (Image credit: Yamaha )

The thing with vinyl, cassette tapes, 8-track cartridges (also in the feature I mentioned above), and any tangible music product is that they have a beginning and an end; they are finite and devoid of suggested tracks or random shuffle mixes. They are a physical representation of your precise musical tastes and predilections at any given time – and my late-1990s-to-early-2000s CD collection is begging for a proper airing.

It's like the 2007 iPod Classic I still cling to despite Apple consigning its dedicated player output to oblivion in 2022; that is the sound of my youth – the sound of a young life full of ambition and promise! Every track on it is a winner. And this is what I want for Christmas, although if you're still looking for ideas to add to your wish list (or buying for someone other than me), see our early Christmas sales in the US and Boxing Day sales in the UK, for even more great holiday and Christmas gift ideas.

OK yes, I have a solo disc player. I want Yamaha's CD-C603 because I can load up five full albums and have them play one after the other. No getting up to switch CDs every 45 minutes, no sliding each disc carefully back into its paper sleeve envelope in the stack, no arguments over the fact that these are delicate items that belong to your sister and should be treated properly.

Around the back of the CD-C603, you get RCA outputs plus an optical out and a remote in/out option. On the anterior chassis, you'll find another nice perk: a front-panel USB input that'll accept and play WAV and FLAC audio files up to 24-bit/96kHz.

Anyone else want to party with me like it's 1999? Come on, we can all worry about Y2K together. Simpler times…

And Santa if you're reading this, the Yamaha CD-C603 is available in black or silver (either look is lovely; I'm not picky) for the trivial fee of AU$899 or €599. I'm still waiting on official US and UK pricing, but that makes it around $590 or £470, give or take. Thank you!",technology
"For around $340, actor Elijah Wood can record you a personalized video wishing you happy birthday. John McGinley, best known for his role in medical TV show Scrubs, will give you a lengthy pep talk for around $475. Priscilla Presley will record a clip talking about everything from Christmas shopping to Graceland for around $200.

These celebrities all use the video-sharing platform Cameo to quickly snap homemade videos for fans who pay them for the honor. They can be seen celebrating anniversaries, lightly roasting people, or offering advice. This summer, however, some videos have been weaponized by an unknown Russian group, which has crudely edited the clips and used them as part of its wide-ranging information warfare tactics against Ukraine.

At least seven seemingly unaware celebrities, including those listed above, have had their Cameo videos manipulated by pro-Russian actors to appear as if they are criticizing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, according to new Microsoft research published today. The altered Cameo videos were shared on social media then heavily reported on by Russian government-owned or controlled newspapers and TV channels, the research says.

The videos started appearing in July and follow similar patterns. “It's at a regular interval,” says Clint Watts, the general manager of Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, which published the research in an update on Russian information and cyber activities. “It's a different actor or actress popping up saying a very similar script,” Watts says.

The videos often see the celebrity talking to “Vladimir” and saying they should get help with possible substance abuse. The videos are later edited to appear as if the celebrity were addressing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky—the Kremlin has consistently pushed disinformation calling Zelensky an addict. The videos can have emoji, links, and social handles added to them before they are shared on social media.

The seven celebrities Microsoft highlights are actors Elijah Wood, John McGinley, Dean Norris, Kate Flannery, and Priscilla Presley; musician Shavo Odadjian; and boxer Mike Tyson. There is no suggestion that the celebrities knew their videos would be edited or manipulated in this way.

“I just want to make sure you are getting help,” Wood, the former Lord of the Rings actor, appears to say in the video. The manipulated video has a Ukrainian flag, a social media handle for Zelensky, and a link to a drug and alcohol research center, and has been made to look like it appeared on Instagram. The video has several jarring cuts throughout and is evidently altered. “I hope you get the help that you need. Lots of love, Vladimir, take care,” Wood seemingly says at the end of the footage. In another video, Kate Flannery, who starred in The Office, appears to say, “You need to go to the rehab,” and that Vladimir deserves a good life.",technology
"The Kremlin’s spy chief Sergei Naryshkin warned the U.S. that Ukraine will turn into its “second Vietnam,” amid disagreement in Congress over funding for Kyiv.

“Ukraine will turn into a ‘black hole’ absorbing more and more resources and people,” Russian foreign intelligence chief Naryshkin said Thursday in a written statement published by his agency’s house journal, the Intelligence Operative.

“Ultimately, the U.S. risks creating a ‘second Vietnam’ for itself, and every new American administration will have to deal with it,” he added.

The warning comes after U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday urged Congress to further support Ukraine with funding. “We can’t let Putin win,” Biden said.

Biden is trying to push through a $61.4 billion emergency funding request for Kyiv, but opposition against further aid to Ukraine has grown among Republicans in the House of Representatives.

The U.S. was engaged in the Vietnam War — fought between South Vietnam and the U.S. on one side and communist North Vietnam backed by the Soviet Union and China on the other — for nearly two decades. The conflict claimed more than a million lives, including tens of thousands from the U.S., and ended with a comprehensive victory for the North Vietnamese forces.

According to a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans still support sending military aid to Ukraine.",political
"Transcript

[Narrator] Every year something switches in the brains

of these coastal brown bears.

Before they hibernate, they lose their ability to feel full

and pack on hundreds of pounds.

In fact, it's become an annual competition

to celebrate these fat bears.

This is 747 in summer, 2022,

and this is 747 in October, 2022.

In the span of a few months,

747 and other bears like him

at remote Katmai National Park

are gaining 20 to 40% of their body weight.

And for bears, that's a good thing.

[gentle music]

[bear vocalizing]

Fat Bear Week is a celebration of success and resilience

in our healthy population of brown bears.

It is a week-long March style madness bracket

where the public gets to vote on their favorite fat bear.

[Narrator] Katmai has some

of the fattest bears in the world

because of a strong sockeye salmon population.

The salmon run lasts from late June through September

allowing the bears to feast.

Sockeye salmon are very nutritious food.

They're actually pretty high calorie.

One sockeye salmon will contain anywhere between

two to 5,000 calorie.

Bears in average, they might catch 10 fish per day.

If they are consuming the entire fish,

they're getting anywhere between

20,000 and 50,000 calories per day.

[Narrator] And salmon is a good source of fat for bears

looking to pack on the pounds.

They're actually going to focus on

just the fattiest parts of the fish.

So the skin, the brains, the eggs in females.

They eat that, they strip the skin, they leave it,

and then some other bears or other animals

will pick off those carcasses.

There is one particular bear, bear 480 Otis,

who was observed on the webcams to consume

45 salmon within a five-hour period.

[bear vocalizing]

[Narrator] And bears are catching these fish

at Brooks Falls.

But why are bears actually fishing?

It has something to do

with a metabolic process called hyperphagia.

Hyperphagia is a general term

that basically denotes overeating.

The term can be applied to humans.

With bears, it means that there is a period of the year

right before they go into hibernation in the fall

where they're eating just as much as they possibly can

in order to try and prepare for hibernation.

[Narrator] But bears are mysterious creatures.

Researchers still don't really understand

why bears enter this state.

There's a few hormones that act as what we call

satiety factors that tell the body that we're full.

A couple of the big ones are a hormone called leptin.

And leptin is released by adipose tissue,

and that is something that helps tell our body like,

Hey, we've got enough stored energy,

so you don't need to eat anymore, you're full right now.

Another one is called ghrelin

that's released by the stomach.

And it says, Hey, I'm full right now.

You should stop eating.

So their body's not telling them I'm full.

So they'll just keep on eating and eating

without that feedback telling them to stop.

If they are not moving a lot, not working a lot,

not using those muscles, then that energy is gonna be stored

because they don't need to use it right then.

And the way that it's generally gonna be stored

for bears is in adipose tissue.

So we're getting a lot of energy

that is then being stored as fat

as they prepare to go into hibernation

so that they can use that through the winter.

[Narrator] Other animals such as hummingbirds

enter hyperphagia before long migration periods.

But for most animals like humans or cats,

hyperphagia is not a good thing.

Overeating can have a lot of negative health impacts.

You know, heart disease, diabetes, very well known.

All of these sorts of things can happen

when you've got uncontrolled eating

and that energy is not being used.

[Narrator] Bears then enter a hibernation period

and go into dens at Katmai.

What hibernation really is,

it's a reduction in the metabolic rate.

So the bear's not necessarily asleep.

In fact, they still have circadian rhythms

where they will be sort of more active during the day,

less active at night.

So they're still awake throughout this entire period.

Heart rate during hibernation

I would think of as being in the 10 to 12 beats per minute.

They're just, their metabolism has been slowed down.

Their heart rate slows down,

their respiration rate slows down.

Generally, they're not eating or drinking,

urinating or defecating,

though there are certainly exceptions to that.

[Narrator] Unlike some other hibernating animals,

bears don't actually see

too much of a drop in body temperature.

So a lot of the animals

where hibernation was originally defined

are some of the smaller mammals.

And they will drop their body temperature down

closer to ambient temperature

and hold very close to freezing.

But brown bears will have a body temperature

of around 36, 37 degrees Celsius.

And then during hibernation,

they're only dropping down to maybe 31 degrees Celsius,

about a six degree drop in body temperature.

[Narrator] Bears can also give birth while in hibernation.

Usually they give birth from late December

up until early February.

Their metabolic rate will increase,

not all the way back up to active state,

but it will increase quite a bit.

And then they give birth,

and immediately after giving birth essentially,

the metabolic rate will drop straight back down

to a full hibernation period.

And the cubs will just kind of climb underneath mom,

and they'll start nursing while mom continues to hibernate.

[Narrator] And all that fat that's been stored up

helps them to survive a long winter.

Bears store all this fat going in hibernation

so that they have energy

so that they can survive through the winter.

They'll lose between 25 and 40% of their body weight

over the winter.

That's gonna be higher for, like, females that give birth.

They're gonna be closer to the 40% range.

Some of the really large males

tend to be closer to 25% range.

One interesting thing,

that fat is not only giving them energy,

it's also providing, so that the catabolism of fat

also provides water.

So we mentioned that they're not drinking all winter long.

This is one way that their body is able to get

a little bit of water since they're losing water constantly

through respiration and stuff like that,

they do need to offset that somehow.

And the catabolism of fat

actually creates water that they're using as well.

Doing any of this type of work on bears

can be very challenging.

Hibernation is fairly well studied physiological state.

Despite that, we still don't really know

what triggers hibernation.

It's really tough to nail down precisely individual factors,

particularly when a lot of times

it's not one factor that's triggering it.

It's multiple things that are working in concert

that might lead to bears

changing physiological states like this.

[Narrator] So who will win

this year's Fat Bear Competition?

One of those big contenders

is the reigning champion, 747.

He still looks really, really good.

When he came out of hibernation,

I was fortunate enough to see him the first week of June.

And I was like, Oh my goodness.

This is a bear that lost one third of his body weight.

There's some other large males

that are also looking really good.

Number 32 Chunk.

There are also some females that are in the running for it.

Bear 128 Grazer.

She is looking really, really good.

"In less than a week, Sony has given us two timely reminders of the tenuousness of digital “ownership” — and both reminders involve things on PlayStation.

Last week, Sony said that, because of content licensing “arrangements,” users wouldn’t be able to watch Discovery content they’ve purchased and that the content would be removed from their libraries as of December 31st, 2023. The resulting list of shows that will suddenly disappear because of corporate agreements is very long. Shows disappearing from streaming services is commonplace, but in this case, people are losing access to shows they bought to watch on demand whenever they wanted.

Then, on Monday, many users were unexpectedly banned from their PlayStation Network accounts, meaning that not only were they blocked from playing multiplayer games or using cloud streaming but they were also locked out of games they purchased digitally from Sony’s PlayStation marketplace. Affected users who may have spent years building a robust digital library were suddenly left without access to content they had bought through no fault of their own. It appears that Sony has since restored account access to people who were accidentally banned, but the company hasn’t explained what happened or said how it might prevent similar unexpected bans in the future. (Sony hasn’t replied to our multiple requests for comment.)

The ephemerality of digital “ownership” isn’t a new issue. Even though downloading and accessing digital content is often easier than trudging to a retail store to buy a physical copy of a game, you’re putting your faith in the platform holders to maintain their digital storefronts, the content on those storefronts, and their account systems so that your access keeps working.

The recent closure of Nintendo’s Wii U and 3DS eShops was a stark reminder that companies have the power to decide when you can buy digital content. While you can still redownload Wii U and 3DS games that you’ve purchased, it seems inevitable that Nintendo will stop letting you do that one day. (It’s already planning to shut down online services for those platforms, after all.) And remember when Google shut down Stadia?

I’m considering switching back to physical games. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge

These recent PlayStation incidents are more aggravating, however, because of how sudden and seemingly unfair they are. With the Discovery content, Sony is giving users a matter of weeks to watch their purchased shows for the last time before the shows are yanked from their library entirely. And Sony isn’t offering any compensation for titles you’ve already bought or a way to transfer those purchases to another store. The PlayStation account bans were as swift as they were unexpected, and while resolution for most arrived within a few hours, Sony still hasn’t shared any public communication about what happened or why users should continue to trust the platform.",technology

Sting? I told you, don't call me at work, man.

Later, all right, dude? Jesus Christ.

Hello, my name is Stewart Copeland.

I'm here to answer your questions from the internet.

This is Drummer Support.

[upbeat music]

@downloadmusicz, Does it matter

how you hold your drum sticks?

We all have our preferences.

I favor orthodox technique like this. Voila.

Most drummers today play matched grip. Voila.

The reason I play like that is because I'm old school.

The snare drum derives from marching bands.

And when the soldier is marching with a snare drum

between his legs, it clunks his knee.

So, he turns it on an angle.

So, to try and play like that is a problem.

So, they play like that,

which is a much more natural position.

@sydnie_alligood, What is the hardest song to drum?

I would say Sister Sadie by Buddy Rich.

Some challenging stuff on there.

In my music, Spirits in the Material World.

It is my personal best noir.

And it's because there's no one.

It's all upbeat.

[drumming music]

1, 2, 3, 4.

1, 2, 3, 4.

2, 3, 4. 2.

It's all upbeats.

@ValAmbrose, Hello. I'm a beginner at drumming.

Do you have any tips that could help me out?

That is what we are here for today.

Learn to fill in with the rhythm.

You don't need a drum set.

Just listen to records and tap on your knees.

That's step one. And everything else derives from that.

Posted by you, drummerwayne101.

Why are The Police hard to play? Because of Stewart.

You just answered the question right there.

You smart.

@lilbit_jojo, Musicians: What does 'playing in the pocket'

mean to you?

How do you achieve that?

The pocket is when musicians

are locked to each other's pulse.

It just feels good.

Like in The Rolling Stones are great example of just,

it's all messed up, it's loose,

it's ramshackle, it's kind of, whoa, whoa.

But they've got that pocket.

They're in sync with each other

in an elemental, organic way.

That is the pocket.

And a pocket is the holy grail

of all ensemble playing.

@ModDrummer, what is the best way for a new drummer

to get better at playing drum fills?

A drum fill is when you're playing along.

[drumming music]

Here's a drum fill.

[drumming music]

Practice slow to achieve speed.

If you're just going as fast as you can,

[drumming music]

you know you're not gonna play perfectly.

But if you concentrate by playing slow.

[drumming music]

You're focusing on getting both hands even.

And you're doing it absolutely at a comfortable speed

so that you can execute perfectly.

So when you're practicing, always be perfect.

When you're on stage, you don't have to give a fuck

because you're just making the shit up.

If you're thinking about being perfect,

you're just gonna be lame.

@Joczkus, QOTD: While in The Beatles,

was Ringo Star a good drummer

or merely a competent drummer?

He was a very good drummer. He had an excellent groove.

A groove is when the music hangs together

in such a way that it's not just correct,

but it makes your hips move.

And he was very imaginative in the way he used drums

in a pop song.

You can find, online, three versions

of The Beatles' first song, Love Me Do.

And there is a version

with their original drummer, Pete Best.

It ain't The Beatles. It's just like kind of lame.

It doesn't hang together.

Then there's a version with Ringo Star.

[drumming music]

♪ Love, love me do ♪

Okay, we're now with The Beatles.

But then for some unknown reason,

they hired a session drummer and Ringo's now on tambourine.

[drumsticks tapping]

And as you listen, you realize the charisma

and the rhythm isn't on the drum set anymore.

That's just some session guy.

The charisma is just the tambourine part has got a vibe.

And that's Ringo.

It's vibe, it's X factor, it's undefinable.

In fact, music is the only art form

that will usurp motor control of your body.

On the dance floor, people are in public

thrusting their pudenda at each other

in an overt sexual display.

Try that without music. You get arrested.

@MikeRusinko, Favorite reggae songs?

Reggae song with the most creative drum

and/or most impressive drumming.

Lively Up Yourself by Bob Marley and The Whalers.

But another one, a seminal piece,

was The Israelites by Desmond Decker.

And that's the first time I ever heard

the bass akwards reggae drum fingering.

Cool thing about reggae drumming

is it's a drum solo all the way through.

They never stop. They're just playing stuff.

[drumming music]

They're always playing something

in contravention of the pop rules of respect for the vocals.

Fuck the vocals.

@mark_lanyon, Do drum kits need tuning?

Yes, you can change the sound of your drums.

I tend to go by tuning them up.

And a little word of advice

for bands is when you're doing your sound check

and you're going boom.

[drumming music]

Okay, second rack, tom tom.

[drumming music]

And they sound huge by themselves.

[drumming music]

But as soon as the band kicks in, they disappear.

By tuning them higher,

they may sound a little, they may sound a little rinky dinky

without the rest of the band,

but as soon as the other music fills in,

they cut through.

@BURNTHI5TOWN, no seriously

how do you learn songs on drums.

By ear?

You don't. You just bang shit.

Yes, by ear, by instinct.

And if you are musical, you will know when 16 bars are up,

when eight bars are up, or whatever.

And a musical memory is a very, very strange thing.

It's much better than any other form of memory.

You can forget people's names.

You can forget what you learned in geography class,

but for some reason you learn how to play a tune

and it lasts forever.

When The Police did a reunion tour,

I didn't even listened to those songs for 30 years,

and I get my practice reel, okay.

Let's see if I can remember how to do this.

I knew everything note perfect. 30 years later.

@TonesOfMusic, Who's the best drummer you've seen Live?

Well, Buddy Rich, Mitch Mitchell.

There's a lot of drummers that I really like

that aren't famous names.

They just have a great loaf,

they just have a great feel to them.

Taylor Hawkins just had a great feel to him.

Ringo Star, Charlie Watts.

No chops there,

but just that groove is way, way cool.

Now, on the younger end of it,

I would say Joey Jordison, sadly departed, with Slipknot.

That little bastard had chops.

You know, kids these days, they start out where we left off

and it's like the Olympics

where every year they can jump

a little higher, run a little faster.

How's that possible?

Has the human species evolved in one year?

I don't know.

But Joey Jordison doing things with his feet

that I aspire to with my hands.

IamtheLaw, How is drum music written?

Is it like standard music?

Yes, it is exactly the same music, only without pitch.

Often percussion scores and drum scores will use lines.

There'll be a line just for the snare drum, rat tat tat tat.

And it has the same note values.

16th note, 8th note, and what have you.

From Coach. Serious question for drummers.

Do y'all feel it when y'all be speeding up or no?

Actually no.

It may feel like the world is slowing down,

but of course one's subjective concept

of tempo, mine being particularly shifty,

is that you feel like you're just doing what's perfect.

For instance, with Police songs,

some of them we had a click, you know,

for a handful of The Police songs.

The reason we did that

was because I'd speed up when it goes into the chorus,

but with the click, wow,

the sensation is that the track just slowed down.

You gotta be kidding. That click just slowed down.

What's the matter with you? Click, I'm human.

This is my rhythm. Tempo is very subjective.

MDXV111, Are there any rules to adding swing to drums?

Well, my daddy was a jazz musician.

He used to complain about the music that I listened to,

'cause where's the swing?

If it don't swing, it don't mean a thing.

Dad, there's all kinds of music that doesn't swing.

But really swing is a specific kind of jazzy sort of feel.

[cymbal music]

It just sort of has a feeling of a shuffle to it.

It's not [cymbal music]

It's what you could call a dotted rhythm or a swing rhythm

or a shuffle.

@MetalWalden, Favorite odd time signature and why?

I don't like odd time signatures.

'cause basically it's like a hiccup.

You know the old joke of how do you conduct five/four time?

1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.

I guess Take Five by Joe Morello

is one of those religious experiences

that every drummer needs to have.

It's kind of the most wrongest form of jazz ever.

[drumming music]

It's sublime.

Posted by you/timmyowns,

Any tips for playing fast punk rock/ pop punk?

I guess the fundamental thing to keep in mind

is to play it fast.

A way to achieve speed is to relax.

Really the vibe you want is.

[drumming music]

Metal drummers are even faster.

[drumming music]

Muscle up. Eat your Wheaties and just play it faster.

This is from Bill Hater.

Hey, music nerds.

I'm trying to understand the concept of polyrhythm.

Poly rhythm is when you play two rhythms at once.

[drumming music]

That's one rhythm.

[drumming music]

It just means a lot of rhythms on top of each other

that kind of contrast with each other.

Well, students, this is all I have for you today.

Eat your Wheaties, do your homework, and drum on.",technology
"Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

This article is part of the Road to COP special report, presented by SQM.

Should countries move quickly to phase out their fossil fuel production or opt for a more gradual “phase-down”? Will wealthy governments like the U.S. cough up tens of billions of dollars for poorer nations’ climate damage — and should China pay too?

When more than 70,000 people from nearly 200 countries descend on Dubai starting next week to negotiate over the fate of the planet, the talks will become the scene for a host of competing national agendas.

The annual U.N. climate summits have drawn criticism for having grown unwieldy since they started in 1995, thronging with corporate lobbyists and marked more by non-binding pledges and squabbles over grammar than their ability to deliver change. But they have a real-world impact, sending signals to markets about governments’ coming policies and reflecting real-world trends. And supporters are quick to point out that they remain the one forum where everyone — from the world’s richest countries to its smallest and most marginal — has a say.

This summit marks eight years since countries landed the Paris Agreement, which sets targets for curbing planetary warming. Countries will now be asked to respond to assessments — known collectively as the “global stocktake” — showing that they’ve failed to do as promised.

They’ll also try to flesh out the pledge they made at last year’s summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt: the creation of a new fund to pay developing nations for the losses they’re suffering from climate change.

Here’s what some of the most influential countries and groupings will push for at the summit, known as COP28.

The United States

President Joe Biden was riding high on a series of policy victories when he rolled into last year’s summit — most of all, the $370 billion in clean energy spending he had approved by signing the United States’ biggest-ever climate law.

This year, Biden is expected to skip the trip to Dubai amid a pile of difficulties, political and otherwise. Polls show him trailing former President Donald Trump, his progressive base is fraying over Israel’s war with Hamas, and Republican control of half of Congress means he’ll have trouble meeting escalating demands for international climate aid.

Instead, special climate envoy John Kerry will be pressing the United States’ agenda.

What the U.S. wants: It will push for an immediate end to new permitting of coal-fired power — not just in China, which keeps building coal plants, but everywhere, according to Kerry.

Cynics would say that’s an easy ask for the U.S. to make, as coal plays an ever-shrinking role in its domestic power mix. But coal is also the dirtiest fossil fuel, producing more carbon dioxide pollution than natural gas or oil, making it an obvious starting place to squelch planet-warming gases.

In a joint statement last week with China, the U.S. also said it supports efforts to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 — something the European Union has championed — and would work to accelerate its deployment domestically. The U.S. is already using Biden’s climate law to push a rapid expansion of clean energy at home, but GOP control of Congress’ lower chamber will make it hard to do more internationally.

The U.S. also wants more countries to tackle greenhouse gases besides carbon dioxide and include them in their next round of climate targets. Non-CO2 gases account for half of the climate change the world is experiencing, but just half of countries include them in their climate plans under the Paris Agreement, a senior State Department official said in a Friday call with reporters. (The administration insisted on anonymity as a condition of the call.)

Last week’s U.S.-China agreement included a pledge by China for the first time to agree to including such gases in its next climate action plan. The nations will combine with the UAE to host a methane and non-CO2 gas summit at COP28.

Where it gets tricky: It’s less clear where the U.S. stands on fossil fuels overall. A draft of the U.S. position on the summit’s post-Paris assessment calls for a phase-out of fossil fuels whose pollution is not captured before it hits the atmosphere — and the U.S. seems poised to highlight the need for carbon capture and storage technology.

But Kerry has waffled on the possibility of eliminating the use of fossil fuels entirely, telling TIME this month: “In order to phase out, you’ve got to first phase down, phase down is the road to phase out.” Still, he has said demand will go down as technologies like electric cars and solar and wind come online.

Challenges over international climate finance could also come back to bite. The U.S. agreed to a tentative deal this month on the outlines of a new fund for climate-damaged countries, but only after insisting on revisions to make it clear that wealthy nations did not have a distinct responsibility to pay. Questions linger about whether the U.S. will come to Dubai ready to commit money.

The United Arab Emirates

The idea of holding COP28 in a petrostate raised eyebrows from the very moment the United Arab Emirates was announced as this year’s host country. The UAE’s choice of Sultan al-Jaber as conference president also met fierce criticism, given that his other job is chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., one of the world’s largest petroleum producers.

Those dual roles have left al-Jaber and the UAE with competing priorities. While al-Jaber has described the decline of fossil fuels as “inevitable,” for example, his company has announced plans to expand its oil and gas operations, backed by $150 billion in spending in the next five years.

Perhaps as a result, the COP28 presidency has been reluctant to respond to calls for a fossil fuel phaseout agreement, although al-Jaber has enthusiastically backed the EU’s push to triple renewables.

What it wants: At a pre-COP summit in late October, al-Jaber summed up his COP28 wishlist as follows: a “robust” response to the assessment of progress and setbacks since the signing of the 2015 Paris Agreement and a “strong” outcome on cutting emissions, as well as a “comprehensive adaptation agreement and groundbreaking solutions on finance.”

Another key priority, he added, is getting the new climate disaster fund up and running.

Where it gets tricky: At some point during the negotiations, the UAE will have to take the lead in hammering out a deal among the nearly 200 nations attending the talks. An ambitious summit outcome could prove the skeptics wrong — but success may depend on the oil-rich nation setting aside its own interests.

Vulnerable island nations

The 39-member Alliance of Small Island States has long fought to showcase the threat that climate change poses to them. The rising seas and other dangers have only made this year’s mission more urgent.

“At COP28, we must go forth with a renewed intensity and urgency to achieve the best possible outcome for our fellow vulnerable islanders on the frontlines of this crisis not of our making,” alliance Chair Pa’olelei Luteru, a Samoan diplomat, wrote in a letter this month.

What they want: In its latest declaration, the bloc is calling for global emissions to peak before 2025, with developed countries taking the lead. It wants to see a phasing out of “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies and is calling for a roadmap that would increase renewable energy uptake and eventually eliminate fossil fuel use to ensure that the world doesn’t breach the Paris Agreement’s stretch goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius.

It says achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement depends on small islands and resource-strapped countries receiving regular and adequate finance. And it’s calling on wealthy nations to meet their past pledges and then boost them, saying a 2009 commitment to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 is now far from sufficient.

AOSIS has also been a leading voice in calling for a fund that would help countries rebuild and repair after climate-driven disasters. It won that 30-year battle when last year’s U.N. summit led to an agreement to set up the so-called loss and damage fund. Now it wants to see that fund filled.

Where it gets tricky: One of the bloc’s most enduring priorities is to ensure the world stands by the 1.5-degree target. Any overshoot would put their lives in peril. But many scientists say that long-term goal looks increasingly unlikely. Luteru told a meeting of climate officials last month that the alliance couldn’t afford any decision in Dubai allowing fossil fuels to be expanded, but major oil and gas producers — including the COP28 host — are already doing just that.

G77 + China

This is the largest bloc in the negotiations, comprising a (deceptive) 134 countries, not 77. It includes China, along with nations such as Brazil, Cuba, Kenya, the Maldives, Pakistan and the UAE.

The G77 represents all developing countries, as they are defined under the U.N. climate convention.

What it wants: The bloc has kept a “solid and unified” position in calling for the loss and damage fund to apply to all developing countries, not just small islands and least-developed countries, as the U.S. and some other developed countries had wanted, G77 chair Pedro Luis Pedroso Cuesta of Cuba has said.

A ministerial declaration issued at the bloc’s annual meeting in September refers to finance as “a cornerstone” of action needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and states that further support will allow for “higher ambitions” among developing countries.

The ministers also said that measures to tackle climate change shouldn’t be used to justify trade barriers or other forms of “unjustifiable discrimination.” And they emphasized that developed countries should “continue to take the leading role” in cutting planet-warming emissions across their economies. ""For developing countries, adaptation to climate change is a priority,” the declaration says.

Where it gets tricky: The diverse nature of the bloc’ s members — everyone from small islands to emerging economies — means they don’t always have the same objectives. Some see the continued use of fossil fuels as detrimental to their very survival, while others view them as core to their economic development.

China

China has a vital stake of its own in the debate, as the world’s largest current producer of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Its emissions are still rising — though when exactly they will peak is a matter of debate. China’s national targets aim for them to stop rising sometime before 2030, while U.S. emissions have already peaked.

What it wants: China has continued to press wealthy nations such as the U.S. to contribute more money to help developing ones.

In concert with the G77, it cites a core tenet of the Paris Agreement that says developed countries should take the lead in cutting their own climate pollution and in supporting poorer countries’ efforts to do the same.

At the same time, China is adamant that it remains a developing country itself, pointing to past international agreements that classify it as such — despite having the world’s second-largest economy. This puts it at odds with the U.S., which has been insisting Beijing should also pay for climate aid and move to cut its emissions faster.

At home, China is investing massively in renewable energy — nearly four times what the U.S. was at the start of the year — and is on track to exceed its target of doubling its wind and solar power capacity five years early.

Where it gets tricky: China also continues to permit and build new coal-fired power, the world’s most polluting source of energy, at a rapid pace. Its climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, has called any phase-out of fossil fuels “unrealistic.”

Ending new Chinese coal developments was not part of last week’s announced climate deal with the U.S., even though it would be a key part of any successful global effort to halt rising temperatures. Instead, the plan called for tripling renewable energy, advancing projects to capture carbon pollution and cutting all greenhouse gases, not just carbon. That last item was a notable step since China is the largest emitter of methane.

The agreement implies that China will use less coal-fired power as it deploys more renewables.

The European Union

The EU arrives in Dubai with two main priorities: scaling up renewables and (mostly) phasing out fossil fuels.

What it wants: Brussels has championed targets to triple the world’s global renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030, hoping to get countries to commit to both goals at COP28.

That effort goes hand in hand with the bloc’s push for a global agreement to phase out “unabated” fossil fuels — those whose carbon emissions are not captured. But that’s a harder sell.

The negotiating mandate given to the European Commission by the bloc’s 27 governments also sets limits for what the EU considers “unabated” fossil fuels, indicating that it wants to end the use of oil, gas and coal in the power sector in the 2030s, for example.

“Fossil fuels may continue to be needed in specific hard-to-abate sectors, that is something we do accept,” EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said at an event in Brussels last month. “But outside of these sectors, we need to get rid of fossil fuels, as many as possible, and as fast as possible.”

The EU has also promised to contribute a “substantial” pledge to the new climate disaster fund once it’s up and running.

Where it gets tricky: Countries including the U.S. and China as well as the UAE’s COP28 presidency have signaled support for the EU’s global renewable energy target, but there’s far less enthusiasm for a fossil fuel phaseout.

The UAE’s COP28 presidency has so far been reluctant to back any such call, the U.S. position is vague and China has declared a phaseout “unrealistic.”

At the same time, a recent call led by small island states to end all use and production of fossil fuels went too far for most EU countries — and the bloc’s phaseout push clashes with European governments’ scramble for oil and gas imports in the wake of the energy crisis unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia, a heavyweight in the so-called Like-Minded Developing Countries negotiating bloc that also includes China and India, often tries to play spoiler at climate summits.

What it wants: This time, the Saudis are coming with a clear message: Let’s phase out greenhouse gas pollution, not fossil fuels. Riyadh wants to continue burning (and selling) oil and gas while capturing emissions with technology that’s not yet available at scale.

Where it gets tricky: That view is at odds with the position of the EU and many vulnerable countries, which fear that the promise of unlimited carbon capture could give the fossil fuel industry a free pass to continue polluting and slow the shift to renewable energy. They argue that carbon removal technology should be used only to balance out emissions from sectors that are tricky to electrify, like aviation.

Saudi Arabia also fiercely opposes EU-U.S. efforts to broaden the contributor base of the new climate disaster fund to other wealthy countries that produce lots of greenhouse gases. (Those countries could include — surprise — Saudi Arabia.) One European negotiator, granted anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, expressed concern that Riyadh would attempt to reopen a fragile agreement on the fund at COP28.

Russia

Much like Saudi Arabia, Russia has a reputation for playing spoiler at global climate talks, and the country’s delegation is heading to Dubai with its usual uncompromising stance.

What it wants: Russia — one of the world’s largest oil and gas exporters — has explicitly come out against a fossil fuel phaseout. “We oppose any provisions or outcomes that somehow discriminate or call for phase-out of any specific energy source or fossil fuel type,” read a Russian submission to the U.N. climate body in September.

Moscow will likely seek to paint the publication of a new “climate doctrine” in October as a sign of progress, with the document enshrining 2060 as Russia’s climate neutrality target. But the updated doctrine also highlighted what Russia sees as positive effects of global warming and avoided linking climate change to fossil fuel combustion.

Where it gets tricky: With its war on Ukraine, Russia has become a pariah state, at least as far as Western countries are concerned. Given its status as one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters, governments will have little choice but to engage with Moscow on climate change, but there are signs Russia’s geopolitical gambit could disrupt the talks both this year and next year: The Russian government is currently blocking EU countries from hosting COP29, a dispute that will have to be sorted out in Dubai.

India

India, newly crowned the world’s most populous nation, wants to see the summit end with promises of more ambitious climate action — at least from wealthy governments such as the U.S. and EU.

What it wants: In a recent submission to the U.N.’s climate body, India writes that the new assessment of climate progress should “motivate developed [countries] to increase the ambition of their actions and support.” Meanwhile, developing countries should focus on improving their climate efforts — “taking into account their national circumstances, capacities and … support received.”

A key priority for New Delhi is “equity,” with India calling on developed countries to live up to their historical responsibility as the largest sources of greenhouse gas pollution. “It is considered unfair if those who have contributed the most to the problem do not contribute more to the solution than those whose contribution is much smaller,” the Indian submission continues.

Two anonymous Indian government officials told Reuters last month that New Delhi wants to push developed nations to become carbon-negative rather than carbon-neutral by mid-century.

Where it gets tricky: The Indian approach echoes U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ call on developed nations to achieve climate neutrality in 2040, rather than 2050 as most currently plan to do. But it sidesteps the issue of ramping up its own climate efforts — Guterres did, after all, also ask developing countries to reach net-zero in 2050. India is only aiming for 2070.

"The volume of attacks directed at other GOP rivals underscores how the debates have largely been a fight for second place. And coupled with polling indicating Trump’s lead has only grown since the debates started in August, it may validate the former president’s decision to skip the debates altogether.

The candidates are attacking each other more than Trump

The candidates have spent little of their time in front of a national audience trying to take down their biggest competitor: Trump, who holds at least a 30-point lead in nearly every poll.

In Wednesday’s debate, the four candidates swiped at each other 28 times while targeting Trump on just nine occasions.

Moreover, attacks on the former president haven’t increased as the debates have gone on, despite his continued rise in the polls. In the first debate, when Trump had 52 percent in the national polls, the candidates leveled 10 attacks against the former president. He now sits at 60 percent, but faces fewer attacks.

Part of the trend may be driven by who makes the stage: Most of the Trump critics in the race just haven’t done very well, either dropping out or not qualifying for later debates.

Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, for example, attacked Trump twice in the first debate before failing to qualify for subsequent contests. Former Vice President Mike Pence attacked his former boss in each of the first two debates but dropped out of the race before the third.

That left only Christie as the only major Trump critic Wednesday on the debate stage, where he lambasted his fellow candidates for acting like the former president was not running and compared Trump to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter franchise who people refuse to name.

“We’ve had these three acting as if the race is between the four of us,” Christie said. “The fifth guy who doesn’t have the guts to show up and stand here, he’s the one who, as [moderators] just put it, is way ahead in the polls.”

Attacks on Trump were up slightly in the fourth debate — thanks to Christie

The Trump critics’ struggles — and Trump’s continued rise in the polls — reflects how opposition to the former president may not play well with Republican primary voters and helps explain why other candidates may be reluctant to go after him, even as he remains their biggest obstacle to the nomination.

Perhaps sensing they are running out of time to overtake Trump, the attacks on the former president ticked up slightly in the fourth debate. Christie went after the former president four times Wednesday, Haley three times, and DeSantis twice.

Asked directly about Trump’s age midway through the debate, DeSantis said “we need somebody that’s younger,” questioned Trump’s electability, and bashed him for not getting Mexico to pay for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and not firing health adviser Anthony Fauci. That kept with a theme of the Florida governor’s campaign of attacking Trump from the right on issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the border.

But Haley and DeSantis dodged some of moderators’ — and Christie’s — efforts to press them into laying into Trump more aggressively. Asked about Trump’s advocacy for a ban on Muslim immigrants, Haley said there should not be a “straight-up Muslim ban” but added that “certain countries are dangerous and are threats to us.” DeSantis declined to characterize Trump as “mentally unfit” when pressed on that phrase by Christie and the moderators.

Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has been a regular defender of Trump across all four debates and has never gone after him. On Wednesday, he accused the other three candidates of “licking Donald Trump’s boots for years” only to engage in “Monday morning quarterbacking” now.

There are clear rivalries — and alliances — among the candidates

Clashes between the candidates were a key feature of the fourth debate. And there were clear lines of fire.

Haley, who has risen steadily in the polls since the first debate, has become a top target for both Ramaswamy and DeSantis in recent debates. Across all four debates, Ramaswamy has gone after Haley 15 times — more than any other candidate has attacked another, according to POLITICO’s analysis.

DeSantis, who had largely ignored Haley in early debates, went on the offense against her seven times in the fourth debate. The attacks began with his first response of the night, when he was asked about his own flagging poll numbers — pivoting to accuse the former U.N. ambassador of caving “any time the left comes after her.”

“Love the attention, fellas,” Haley said after being targeted multiple times in the first 15 minutes of the debate.

For her part, Haley went after both DeSantis and Ramaswamy on a few occasions — but largely in response to their criticisms. At one point, she declined to respond when Ramaswamy accused her of corruption and identity politics, saying, “It is not worth my time to respond to him.”

Christie, who has largely avoided singling out Haley for criticism across all four debates, also stepped up to her defense early in Wednesday’s debate after a slew of Ramaswamy attacks against her.

“Nikki and I disagree on some issues … What we don’t disagree on is this is a smart, accomplished woman. You should stop insulting her,” he said.

Christie himself was the least-attacked candidate on Wednesday. His opponents might just not see him as a threat: Christie is polling at 2.7 percent nationally, according to FiveThirtyEight.

Republicans have frequently gone after Biden — but less over time

Criticism of Biden has been a frequent feature of the GOP debates, but it’s decreased every debate.

Candidates went after Biden nearly twice as many times as they did Trump in the first debate. But on Wednesday, the four GOP candidates attacked the president nine times — exactly as often as they went after Trump.

Polls show the incumbent president is unpopular, and Republican candidates may see going after Biden as a good and safe way to gain approval from the party’s base and independent voters who dislike him.

But criticizing the president’s handling the economy or accusing him of failing to secure the U.S.-Mexico border also does little to distinguish the GOP candidates from each other or Trump.

While the debates are meant to help narrow the Republican primary field, the participants are largely competing with each other for second place.",political
"OMG, I actually want this. Lego has only gone and created what looks like the perfect gift for camera and Lego lovers like me; the Retro Camera creator set.

I grew up playing with Lego, and 30 years later my own kids play with those original pieces, plus their own new sets added to the mix. And now, as TechRadar’s Cameras editor and a long-time photographer, I’ve found the new Lego set I really want for myself, a SLR build kit.

What’s even better is that the Retro Camera is part of the low-cost 3-in-1 Creator set series, whereby the pieces included can be used in any one of three builds, in this case a SLR camera, video camera or TV, all for just $20 / £17.99 on the Lego website.

That would make it a perfect candidate for a secret Santa gift or stocking filler, but sadly the product is listed as not being available until 1 January 2024.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Lego) (Image credit: Lego) (Image credit: Lego)

I’m definitely going to buy this set, and once it arrives I’ll be starting with the SLR, which has some super-neat features that have put a smile on my face already, such as a moving lens and ‘working’ film wind handle, plus a hotshoe.

You also get a camera strap, two film canisters and the film door on the back opens to slot one of them in. There’s film exposures with shots like giraffe and butterfly on them included, too. It’s an impressive number of details included in what is a low-cost and basic Lego set.

Once that build is done and I feel like a change, the SLR camera can be taken apart and the pieces used to make either the video camera with pull-out film door, or an analog-style TV set.

The Retro Camera is not the first photography-themed set that Lego has made – earlier this year there was a partnership with Disney to celebrate the entertainment giant’s 100-year anniversary with a Walt Disney Tribute Camera (set no. 43240) – but it’s the most accessible.

There’s no pre-order for the Lego Retro Camera (set no. 31147), which contains 261 pieces and is recommended for those eight years and older, but you can put a reminder in the diary for January 1, 2024, which is noted on Lego’s website as the SSD. Bring on the new year! (And sorry kids, this one's just for daddy.)

If you love Lego but cameras aren't really your thing, there's plenty of great Cyber Monday lego deals still available. We've also put together plenty of Christmas gift ideas, plus guides to the best Christmas sales in the US and Boxing Day sales in the UK.",technology

This is DJ Shortkut

and you're watching levels, levels, levels of turntablism.

Today, I've been challenged to explain turntablism

in 15 levels of increasing complexity.

[hiphop music]

A lot of the stuff that turntable encompasses

come from the foundation of DJing.

Turntablism is the art of using the

turntable as a musical instrument to

produce entirely new musical compositions.

The two most known sounds that we use

in scratching is fresh,

and ah.

Fresh and ah comes from a song called

Change the Beat by Fab 5 Freddy.

The sounds fresh and ah are pretty sharp and pretty clear.

From the minute you release the record

just on the release alone,

you know how sharp it comes in.

This is level one, the baby scratch.

This scratch was invented

by Grand Wizzard Theodore from New York.

There's two types of baby scratches,

a short one otherwise known as tip.

I look at the platter as a clock.

I have a line on my record.

The mark will show us where each sound is.

Position wise, it would be from 12 o'clock to one o'clock

and a long baby scratch,

which would be from 12 o'clock to two o'clock.

I'm applying enough pressure

on the record where I could still see the slipmat

right under the record, still rotate.

For the baby scratch, My fader stays open

and my hand stays on the platter.

With the baby scratch, you wanna make sure

that you get a little bit of the air right

before the sound starts so you can hear the sound in full.

Now let's do a combination

of both baby scratches with a beat.

[hiphop music]

One of the things to keep in mind

is there's four beats to a bar.

1, 2, 3, 4,

2, 2, 3, 4.

Counting bars help us keep time

to when we scratch to these beats,

whether you tap your foot, nod your head,

move side to side, sway back and forth.

That's how you keep time counting bars.

For level two, we're increasing complexity

by manipulating the amount of pressure on the platter

while using the crossfader.

Level two: push, release, and drags.

A push scratch creates a higher tone.

A drag scratch produces a lower tone.

And a release scratch produces a mid tone.

To do these scratches,

we start with the fader closed.

With level one, we use the light amount

of pressure on the platter.

With the push, my hand position is at nine o'clock

and I'm pushing the record forward,

applying a good amount of pressure

onto the platter to produce a higher pitch.

For the drag scratch, we add pressure

to the platter to create a breaking sound.

I'm moving the crossfader

from the closed position to the open position.

And I'm moving the record

from 12 o'clock to about two o'clock.

A release scratch requires you to release the record,

right when the sound starts to play at its normal speed

while moving the crossfader to the open position.

And this is what it sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

The most common mistakes when we do these scratches,

is your hand placement on the record.

You wanna make sure your hand is

in the nine o'clock position.

That way you have enough space between nine o'clock

so about 12, and then back to six o'clock where

you don't end up knocking the needle off the record.

For the next level, we're going to increase complexity

by adding speed and sharper cuts.

This is level three, the stab scratch.

This scratch starts with the fader in the closed position,

kind of similar to the push scratch.

My hand's on the nine o'clock position.

And I'm moving forward while moving

the crossfader into the open position.

Right away, I'm pulling back the fader

to the closed position while moving the record

back to the original position.

The difference between the push scratch

and the stab scratch is I'm adding a little bit

of speed while using the crossfader.

My hand never leaves the record.

As I'm pushing the record forward,

I'm moving my crossfader to the

open position at the same time.

But right away I'm pulling the record back

and the crossfader back to the closed position

without hearing the reverse sound.

And this is what it sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

A common mistake is not moving fast enough

and hearing the reverse sound.

Right there, I'm hearing the reverse sound,

which you're not supposed to do in a stab scratch.

In this next level, we're about to

increase complexity with our crossfader.

This is level four, the chirp scratch.

This scratch was made popular by DJ Jazzy Jeff

in the song, The Magnificent Jazzy Jeff.

So my fader starts in the open position.

As I'm moving the record forward,

I'm moving the crosser back to the closed position.

The crossfader functions like an on and off switch.

The coordination between the fader

and the record is important to practice

in order to catch the beginning

or the tip of the sound producing the chirp.

The second part of the scratch is moving

the crossfader back to the open position

while moving the record back to the top of the sound.

Now, this is what it sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

The most important thing to remember

about this scratch is your coordination

between the record and the fader.

For the next level, we're about to increase complexity

with our timing and hand control.

This is level five, tears.

Similar to the baby scratch,

your hand never leaves the platter for the tear.

But what's different with the tear scratch

is adding an additional push

which sounds like a split or tear in the sound.

The most common tear scratch is the

motion of moving the record forward

and moving the record back twice.

My hand position's at nine o'clock,

marker's at 12 o'clock and my crossfader is open.

The most common mistake when doing the tear scratch

is not accentuating each movement on the platter.

This is what the tear scratch sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

In the next level, we're about to increase

complexity with speed and rhythm.

This is level six, the transform scratch.

That name would come from the

sound the robots would make

from the early eighties cartoon, The Transformers.

This scratch has been associated

with DJ Cash Money and Jazzy Jeff.

So what we're doing here is using the

crossfader as an on and off switch

while moving the record back and forth.

My hand position's at nine o'clock

and I'm moving the record back and forth,

pretty much a baby scratch,

while moving the crossfader off and on.

We'll do this with two clicks.

Now to get a circular motion in that sound,

we'll move the record back and forth,

clicking the crossfader twice in both directions.

Now you can add more clicks to

this scratch to get different patterns.

For the transform scratch, if you use longer sounds,

you'll be able to add more clicks within that sound.

This ah sound starts from 12 o'clock to about five o'clock.

I'll add as much clicks as I can within that,

moving the record back and forth.

This is what the transform scratch sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

So with this scratch, the principle rhythm maker comes

from your movement on the crossfader.

Level seven, fades.

The fade scratch is a combination of either doing tears

or babies on the platter while

moving the volume control from 10 to one,

giving it that loud to soft effect.

The speed can change depending

on what tempo you're scratching to.

This is what the fade scratch sounds like with a beat.

[hiphop music]

In the next level, we're gonna do a combination

of all the techniques we've learned so far.

Level eight, a combination of levels

one through seven, over a beat.

[hiphop music]

One of the most common mistakes when you do combos

of all those scratches is not being able to pace yourself.

In the next level of increasing complexity,

we're about to take on one of the most

difficult scratches involving the crossfader.

Level nine, the crab scratch.

The origins of the crab scratch came

from the UK by a DJ named DJXL who named it the twiddle.

He was using both of his fingers

on the crossfader while using his thumb

as resistance to create off and on sounds.

Qbert came up with the idea to utilize all his fingers

from his pinky to his index finger

to skate across the in and out position

as your thumb acts like a spring to close the fader back.

My hand's on the nine o'clock position.

I have my sound starting at 12 o'clock.

The platter movement is basically a baby scratch.

So basically I'm rolling and clicking

my fingers from pinky to index finger.

As my thumb works as a spring to

move the fader back to the open position.

This is what the crab scratch sounds with a beat.

[hiphop music]

The most common mistake when you do crab scratch

is not sounding fluid with it.

You try to get every click in there.

Some people actually use their ring finger

to their index finger while doing the crab scratch.

I like using all four fingers

from pinky to index to get that full effect

and to get all those clicks in there.

This is what it sounds like from your ring finger

to your index finger.

But when you add your pinking in there,

you get a lot more clicks in there.

In the next level, we're about to

increase complexity with our fader control.

Level 10, the one-click flare.

So we start with an open fader.

After doing a chirp forward,

immediately reopen the fader.

The second half of the scratch is rewinding the record

back to the top of the sound,

the fader's open, and do a reverse chirp

and immediately open the fader.

This is how we do the one-click flare with a beat.

[hiphop music]

So the one-click flare is definitely a

hard scratch to get right away.

It's gonna take a lot of practice

'cause you have to be in sync

with the fader and the platter movement

to get that one-click to make two sounds.

We're about to increase complexity

by adding more clicks to the one-click flare.

This is level 11, the two-click flare

otherwise known as the orbit scratch.

The orbit scratch, or the two-click flare,

was created by a DJ named DJ Disk

from The Invisibl Skratch Piklz.

Just like the one-click flare,

we add one click and made two sounds.

Now we're adding two clicks to create three sounds.

You're starting your crossfader in the open position.

As you move your platter forward,

you're clicking the crossfader twice

but ending again in the open position.

Now to complete the scratch,

we're gonna do the same motions back and forth.

Two clicks forward, two clicks backward

but ending the crossfader in the middle position.

This is what the two-click flare sounds like over a beat.

[hiphop music]

One of the most common mistakes

when you do a two-click flare,

is it kind of might sound like a

transform as it comes out first.

It's one of those scratches where

you have to find your sweet spot.

You'll know you'll have the two-click flare,

when you hear kind of a rolling, circular motion.

That's why it's called an orbit,

where it's just kind of traveling.

When I do the two-click flare,

I kind of do a galloping motion on the crossfader.

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da.

And you'll find that role somewhere

as you move the record back and forth.

For the next level, we're about to increase complexity

by layering multiple scratch techniques.

Level 12, the rhythm scratch.

The rhythm scratch was a popular scratch

done in the eighties by DJs like Jazzy Jeff,

Magic Mike, DJ Aladdin.

The rhythm scratch is made of five baby scratches.

Two normal babies.

One short baby.

Another normal baby.

And one short one.

When you put all those together, it sounds like this.

With this scratch we don't use the crossfader.

It solely relies on your hand motion on the platter.

For this demonstration, I'll be using the pitch control

to move the beat from a slow BPM to a faster one.

[hiphop music]

For the next level, we're increasing complexity

by making a beat off of one turntable.

Level 13, drum scratching.

One of the first times I heard drum scratching

was Jam Master J on a Run-D.M.C record

called Here We Go [Live at the Fun House].

In the beginning of that record,

Jam Master Jay would grab a kick

and a snare off one record and make a drum beat.

Boom, ba-cha, boom, boom, ba-cha.

I have my kick at 12 o'clock

and my snare at about two o'clock.

We have to be very accurate while doing drum scratches

because if you get it in the middle of the sound

it'll sound kind of sloppy and muddy.

You wanna get even a little bit of that air

before the sound starts to get it crispy

or going back and forth from sound to sound

and holding those sounds and isolating them as we go.

When you do the drum scratch,

you definitely have to have some

kind of internal metronome in you.

Swaying back and forth, tapping your foot.

You don't really see any live drummers

just kind of stiff and just doing that, right.

They're are still kind of grooving.

Same thing applies when we do the drum scratch.

Knowing the position where you are

on the record using the clock system

knowing where your marks are at is key to this scratch.

[hiphop music]

So while doing the drum scratch,

I wasn't using the crossfader.

I was using the volume control to

be able to go back and forth from kick to snare.

That's just my preference.

Or you could use the crossfader.

[hiphop music]

In this level, we're about to increase complexity

with one of the most advanced art forms in turntablism.

Level 14, beat juggling.

One of the first times I heard be juggling was

from a DJ named Steve Dee from New York

from the X-ecutioners, originally known as the X-Men.

Basically, he was creating a new

pattern from existing records

and doing live manual remixing back

and forth from turntable to turntable.

Normally done with two of the same copies of records.

For this demonstration, on my left turntable

I'll have a kick

and on my right turntable, I'll have a snare.

I'll basically make a pattern

and creating a complete bar.

Going back and forth from kick to snare.

Think of beat juggling as a cut and paste method.

You're continuing the beat pattern

from where you left off on one turntable

by moving the crossfader to the other turntable

in order to resume the sequence.

Doing this, you'll have to have a good amount of

cadence, rhythm and have that internal metronome

like we did with drum scratching.

Basically it's drumming but with two turntables.

It's also important not to hear any residual sound

from the turntable that you just moved the crossfader from

so that you complete a clean transition

from one platter to the other.

[hiphop music]

For this final level of increasing complexity,

we're about to do everything that we

learned right now all in one.

This is level 15, a combination of all levels.

[hiphop music]

So with everything we learned today,

like I said it takes a lot of practice,

a lot of patience and a lot of focus.

I hope watching this video inspires you.

You'll never know what you'll find out

messing with two turntables.

Either whether you scratch or make beat juggle routines up.

Stay true to what you're doing.

Stay true to the craft.

Once you find something out

that maybe no one knows,

share that with people

because that's what makes this art form evolve and grow.",technology
"Transcript

I'm Levy Rozman chess educator, YouTuber, and author.

Let's answer some of your questions from the internet.

This is Chess Support.

[upbeat music]

@manthosh12 asks, Do chess players trash talk?

That way this game would be more fun.

You can't talk to your opponent during a chess game, period.

So you definitely can't trash talk an opponent

during a chess game.

But outside of it, oh, it's some of the best

passive-aggressive soap opera drama

you can possibly imagine.

Now that we have a young grandmaster like Hans Neimann,

who despite his checkered pass, no pun intended,

will actually go out of his way to trash talk other people

and have more eyeballs on the game.

So yes, but also no.

@AnnaCramling, what, you got Anna for this video, says,

Is there any more satisfying checkmate than this one?

First of all, hi, Anna.

Second of all, yes, obviously.

Probably the most satisfying checkmate in all of chess

is smothered mate, when an opponent's king

is stuck on the edge of the board,

boxed in by his own pieces,

and you used this knight and you gallop into the position,

and the king is smothered in the corner by his own army

while this knight attacks,

and there's nothing that you can do.

@KeenChess asks, Was the Hans Neimann-Magnus Carlsen

cheating controversy good publicity for chess?

What would you make of the drama?

Overall, it was a net positive for chess.

There was a massive controversy

between Magnus Carlsen and Hans Neimann

where the young grandmaster from the United States

defeated the world champion,

and Magnus withdrew from the tournament

basically doing everything

but directly accusing Hans of foul play.

Millions of people around the globe

started thinking of chess.

They were hearing all of these ridiculous headlines,

but at the end of the day, it just sparked their interest

in the game itself.

@neofight78 asks, Okay, chess peeps, what's the opening

or variation that's the most fun for you to play?

One of my favorite variations to play

is when I'm playing with the white pieces

and I open with the king's pawn e4

and black responds with c5,

which is the Sicilian Defense.

It's the most popular and combative opening for black

fighting for the center with a flank pawn,

a pawn that's not one of the two center pawns.

And now I will play what's called a delayed wing gambit.

I would go pawn to a3.

And the idea here is very, very sneaky.

You basically want to give up this pawn,

so black is going to take it,

and then you are going to take back.

Now black is gonna say, Wow, what a dummy.

I just won that pawn.

Now I have an extra pawn.

And then you start kicking out the knight

and you get this massive center.

You have a lot of pawns in the center.

You can even plug another one in.

And then you can use all of this open space for your pieces.

And a lot of players get overwhelmed in this position.

Find a chess opening or variation that you like,

that you understand, that gets you to a position

where you know the plans better than your opponent.

@ericfarley1 asks, How does the Elo rating work?

I'm intrigued.

An Elo is the number which quantifies your skill level.

It's not an acronym.

The first letter is a capital E, and then it goes L-O.

And the way Elo works is that it goes up and down

or stays the same depending on your results.

If you're rated 1200 and you play a 1100,

you will gain a certain amount of points if you win,

but your opponent will actually gain slightly more

because they're beating somebody with a higher Elo.

The minimum Elo to qualify for grandmaster is 2500.

So in over-the-board live chess,

the highest ever Elo achieved is by Magnus Carlsen.

But online, Stockfish,

which is the strongest chess AI in the world,

is estimated to be around 3600.

At my peak I was 2430,

then I lost to a bunch of nine-year-olds.

@jonnyceepembs asks, How hard would Capablanca be to beat

with modern preparation tools at his disposal?

How good would Capablanca be with modern preparation?

Ridiculously good?

Probably the world chess champion.

Jose Raul Capablanca was one of the best chess players

of his generation.

He was a fantastic positional player.

He was an expert endgame player as well.

The only thing that he didn't do

was live in the modern century in the age of computers.

He managed to do all of that with chess being on paperback.

Modern preparation tools are just a complete game changer.

They allow you to analyze positions

for 15, 20 moves in advance.

The information gap from 1920, 1930 to nowadays

is just absolutely absurd.

An 11-year-old now with modern preparation tools

could probably beat Capablanca in a match

just on the information that is available

to the 11-year-old that Capablanca

in the 1920s and '30s would not know.

@anuragsingh asks, What is going on in your mind

when you have to play your next move?

Like, what is your mind processing?

Combinations? Simulations?

It's a great question.

Jose Raul Capablanca said,

I only think of one move at a time,

and it's the best move.

Chess is all pattern recognition.

Most experienced chess players have studied a lot.

They have done thousands of chess puzzles.

So I might be remembering something in my memory palace.

I might be remembering there was this game played in 2012

between grandmaster A and grandmaster B in this city.

He was wearing a blue shirt,

and in that game he played this.

The more you play chess and the more you study,

that is how you are going to figure out

some of these good moves or an evaluation of a position.

@YourBudJosh asks, Do old people still play chess in parks?

What parks? Do you have to be old to play?

I wanna play chess in the park.

There is no minimum age requirement

to play chess at your local public park,

but historically chess has been associated

with old guys at the park.

When I was five or six years old,

my grandparents in Brooklyn would walk me to the park

where local 70-year-old men would sit there squabbling.

A lot of park chess players are actually really good.

The average park chess player in Union Square Park

or Washington Square Park is better than you

watching this right now.

So go play against them.

And many of them are very, very friendly.

They will give you some pointers.

And at least here in New York City,

it's customary to throw them, like, 3 or $5 for a game.

@sebilozano asks, Hey, Siri.

How much do chess players make?

Chess players make exactly what they win in tournaments.

Nowadays in 2023 there's also things like endorsement deals.

Magnus Carlsen is famously sponsored by Puma, MasterCard.

You can also get invited to paid corporate

or speaking engagements, which a lot of them do

because a lot of people respect chess players now.

So it used to be that if you were outside

of the top 20 grandmasters in the world,

I'm not even sure you would break six figures

on a good year.

If you're also traveling the world

constantly playing tournaments

and you're just not succeeding,

there is so much more pressure.

You're probably losing money in a calendar year.

@MackenzieWeber3 says, Learning how to program

has changed my perspective on a lot of things.

How does a chess bot able to analyze an entire game

and point out which moves are the best?

That's so wild.

Chess bots have been better than human beings

for something like 30 years.

Chess bots like Stockfish, Leela, AlphaZero

use really, really ridiculously powerful servers

and they can analyze tens of millions of positions

every single second.

What they do is then they go out into the future

40,50 moves in many, many different branches,

and they come right back

and they evaluate what a move would do

depending on what's out there in the future.

@_namori_fan_, that's a lot of underscores, says,

Does Stockfish blunder?

No.

A blunder in a traditional sense is a monumental mistake.

Stockfish doesn't blunder

anywhere near the traditional sense,

but at times it will place a piece on a certain square

and then not realize that actually 20 moves down the line

that piece is not supposed to be positioned there

and all of a sudden it's too late to defend itself.

Stockfish has lost. Not to humans.

It's lost to other bots like Leela, Komodo, or Torch,

but it definitely doesn't blunder like we do.

@erosindomita asks, How does chess notation work?

I'm going to bite someone.

No need for physical assault.

It is quite simple.

If I was gonna play a chess game right now,

I would play pawn to d4.

And the way you write that down

is just the square that the pawn moved to.

You don't have to write P.

So it's kind of shorthand.

So you would write d4,

and that is what that would look like.

And then your opponent would, let's say, play e6,

pawn to e6.

You would write e6 and it would be d4 e6.

White made their first move and black made their first move.

C4, so you would write c4.

Now let's say your opponent developed a knight.

They played knight to f6.

K is king, so knight is N, knight f6.

So it would be Nf6.

There's some moments where two pieces

can actually move to the same square.

For example, in this position, both of black's knights

can go to d7.

So if this knight went to d7, it started on b.

So knight b d7.

And if this knight went to d7,

it would be knight f to d7.

Bonus! What if both knights were on the exact same file?

Now, knight b d7 is the same exact thing,

so their only differentiator is what rank they're on.

So knight 8 d7, knight 6 d7.

You only ever really need to do this with knights and rooks

because the bishops can never go to the same square

'cause they go on opposite colors.

@aydenb_ says, Chess prodigies are so crazy to me.

How are you seven years old and beating people

who spend 60 years of their lives learning chess?

That's actually the beautiful thing about chess.

It's a timeless game.

And incredibly, children and adults learn chess

in vastly different ways.

People who start chess at a very young age

have a chance of getting to a much higher ceiling overall

in their chess careers.

That's why you'll see at a local chess tournament

seven-year-old playing a 60-year-old.

I played a chess tournament in St. Louis

a couple of years ago,

and I played the number four, number two,

and number one ranked 11-year-olds in America,

and I only scored 50%.

@ADVUniverse asks, What is the single piece of chess advice

that help you improve the most?

The biggest piece of advice that I give to kids or adults

trying to learn this game

is to completely disconnect your ego

from this learning experience.

Be prepared to lose a lot.

There is no other way to get better at chess.

You will probably lose three out of every four games

that you play, but there are four to five things

that you can learn in each of those games.

If you are unable to do that because it makes you angry

or upset or frustrated,

then you are never going to get better at chess.

@iamalisadiq says, Hey, what is the prize stake

for this Chess World Cup?

So the prize stake for this year's World Cup in 2023

was won by Magnus Carlsen,

and it was estimated to be something like $110,000.

The Chess World Cup is actually different

than the World Chess Championship.

The World Cup is a knockout tournament

that happens every two years in chess.

It starts with 128 players and ends with two.

@RoamWithJon asks, How is chess boxing a thing?

Chess boxing is a sport that combines chess

and boxing shockingly,

and essentially all it is, is a game of chess with a person,

and then you pause the game and you box for a round,

and then you finish the chess game

from the point it was started.

And then you keep going until one person either wins

in the chess or knocks the other out.

It's a fascinating sport, and it wasn't too popular

until 2022 when Ludwig, massive YouTuber,

actually put on the chess boxing event.

I was a part of it. I was a commentator.

I thought I was gonna fight, but I'm a little bit too scared

of getting punched in the face.

@RoudSync asks, I still can't wrap around the concept

of speed chest.

How can you decide a move under a second?

Form a strat?

And it usually lasts under a minute.

The amount of brain cells you use in this.

There's no brain cells at all.

The average really good chess player

probably doesn't know how to make toast.

There is no correlation between chess and intelligence,

except in my case.

Listen, speed chess is all pattern recognition.

If you've seen it before,

it's not always going to be a one-to-one,

but you're gonna have enough experience

that you know what parts go where.

These people can do it in two, three seconds.

Speech chess is my favorite type of chess.

If I have to get slowed down,

then that's where I really struggle.

@SabaOsmaanqazi asks, Where did chess come from?

Allegedly around 600 A.D. in India.

It was called Chaturanga,

and back then the rules were slightly different,

but that apparently is the first

earliest recorded instance of chess.

And I would know, I was there.

@bison_booze asks, Did chess ever change its rules?

I mean, for a game that old,

they must have made a few balance patches.

Over the years, there have been very, very few changes

to the game of chess.

There are things called variants

where they, let's say, shuffle the back row of pieces,

and now that's called Chess960,

or Giveaway where you try to lose all of your pieces,

and so on and so forth.

And the last time there was really any major update

is when they instituted en passant.

@rinnequan asks, Bro, what is en passant?

What the hell? I just found out about this rule.

En passant in chess is a rule that came out,

I don't know, something like 200 years ago,

and essentially all it is,

your pawn has crossed the center line

and your opponent makes a pawn move

and stands side by side with your pawn.

They have to move two squares.

For this move and this move only,

you can take that pawn diagonally behind it.

The only way you can en passant

is if a pawn moves two squares for this turn.

You cannot do that if it was another piece.

If your opponent just moved their knight to that square,

you cannot en passant a knight.

You would get punched in the face.

@Mzslayer1 asks, Chess lovers, what do you consider

to be the most famous move in chess history?

1972, Bobby Fischer, Boris Spassky,

World Chess Championship,

United States versus Soviet Union, Cold War era.

They begin the match, and toward the endgame

Fischer captured a pawn

and got his bishop trapped in one move.

It was an oversight that, let's say,

an amateur player wouldn't even make.

It was just a complete just mental slip for a move.

Fischer captured a pawn

in the corner of the board essentially,

and all Spassky had to do was move his pawn one square.

And his bishop had no way out.

It was a completely inexplicable mistake.

Fischer had not made a mistake like that

in his entire career,

and he never made a mistake like that ever again.

Bobby Fischer went on to lose that game,

but a World Championship match is played over many games.

And even though he lost that first one

in this completely ridiculous fashion,

he actually went on to dominate and win the match.

@cozyKKyon asks, Why do chess players resign

instead of taking the loss?

People at the highest level resign

when they know they're going to lose

and they know that their opponent knows how to beat them.

Most of you watching this should not resign

because you never know.

Stalemate is possible at the end of a game,

running out of time by accident, Wi-Fi disconnecting.

To resign, you would either tip over your king,

which is the dramatic way to do it.

You would click a button on chess.com if you were playing,

or you'll see grandmasters often times just pause the clock

and I would extend my hand to my opponent to shake it,

which is just a silent way of saying, I surrender.

@QuoraQuestions4 says,

What is the greatest chess match ever?

The best chess match which took a long period of time,

you probably have to look at 1984,

Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov.

And back then it was decided

by the first person to win six games.

Karpov got out to a five-nothing lead,

and then Kasparov did not lose

and he defended, defended, defended.

He fought to make it five-three

with, like, 30 draws in the middle,

and the match basically had to be called off

due to health concerns.

It was like two months of playing chess against each other.

I would never survive.

So that's all the questions we have for you today.

I just wanna say a big thank you to all of you

for watching chess, playing chess,

supporting chess in any way, shape, or form.

Until next time, thank you for watching Chess Support.

"In her first campaign stop since Wednesday’s contentious Republican debate, Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador and former governor of South Carolina, largely ignored the many attacks that her fellow candidates, aware of her rise in the polls, had lobbed at her. What she did discuss suggested she continued to feel that the criticism wasn’t, as she said on Wednesday night, “worth my time.”

Speaking to about 100 people in a convention center conference room in Sioux City, Iowa, on Friday, Ms. Haley stuck to the topics that have become the cornerstones of her campaign — her foreign policy experience and her willingness to tell “hard truths.” She railed against China, pledged to be a fiscally responsible president and even answered a question about fears that Venezuela could invade its South American neighbor, Guyana.

Despite her growing rivalry with Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to become the chief alternative to former President Donald J. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, Ms. Haley did not mention Mr. DeSantis by name, nor did she mention the debate — where she was in the line of fire for much of the evening — until the final minutes of the event.

Responding to a voter’s question about her standing in the race, Ms. Haley said she did not think she needed to win the Iowa caucus to be successful.",political
"Two other Democrats joined the letter in addition to Moskowitz: Reps. Joe Courtney of Connecticut and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey.

About a dozen other Democrats had a separate response. They urged the governing boards to update their codes of conduct, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

“Given this moment of crisis, we ask you to review and update your school policies and codes of conduct to ensure that they protect students from hate, and detail what action steps you are taking to combat antisemitism and to ensure Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses,” lawmakers wrote. “This problem is urgent and we request a swift and comprehensive response.”

Key context

The letters come as the scrutiny of the college leaders intensifies after a more than five-hour hearing on their response to antisemitism on campus. But most of the public outcry has been over the leaders’ refusal to say whether calls for “Jewish genocide” violate their codes of conduct around bullying or harassment.

Gay and Magill have since apologized for their testimonies, where they said they personally did not agree with the rhetoric used by those students and were committed to preserving free speech on campus.

Magill released a video statement, which has been viewed more than 38 million times on X.

“I was not focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate,” she said.

Here are some other updates on the presidents:

Magill faces the toughest scrutiny

Magill has faced the worst criticism from top Democrats in her state and other lawmakers, though they were not a part the letter asking for the university to update its code of conduct and many have stopped short of calling for her resignation.

Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) called Magill’s comments “offensive,” and said “calling for the genocide of Jews is antisemitic and harassment, full stop.” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said Magill’s testimony was “embarrassing for a venerable Pennsylvania university.” And Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a first-term Democrat, also slammed Magill’s testimony as a “failure of leadership.”

On top of that, the school stands to lose millions of dollars from donors who are threatening to pull their donations if Magill doesn’t step down. Hundreds of Penn alumni, donors and students have also called on Magill to resign. The Wharton Board of Advisors on Thursday called for new university leadership, according to a letter obtained by The Daily Pennsylvanian.

And the University of Pennsylvania board of trustees is scheduled to meet via phone at 5 p.m. on Sunday to discuss next steps, the Inquirer reported.

Kornbluth has support

Before the letter was sent, MIT’s governing board on Thursday said they support Kornbluth.

“The MIT Corporation chose Sally to be our president for her outstanding academic leadership, her judgment, her integrity, her moral compass, and her ability to unite our community around MIT’s core values,” the board said in a statement. “She has done excellent work in leading our community, including in addressing antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate, which we reject utterly at MIT. She has our full and unreserved support.”

Gay apologized

Gay apologized in an interview Friday with The Crimson, saying: “When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret.”

The House Education Committee announced Thursday that it will investigate Harvard, MIT and Penn over their responses to antisemitism.

“Harvard’s work to combat antisemitism in our community is advancing with the highest commitment and attention from University leaders,” a university spokesperson said Thursday. “The University looks forward to sharing information with the Committee as it pursues its inquiry.”",political
"“We’ve given them no reason not to continue [attacking],” he said of the Houthis.

Houthi assaults on commercial shipping have increasingly drawn U.S. Navy warships into the line of fire in recent days. On Sunday, the destroyer USS Carney was involved in an hourslong firefight and shot down three drones after Houthi forces fired missiles and drones at the civilian vessels. Then on Wednesday, the destroyer USS Mason took out yet another drone headed toward the ship.

But top Biden administration officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have agreed that, for now, retaliating against the Houthis in Yemen is not the right course of action — despite urging from some military officers. The administration has worked to contain the violence in Israel and Gaza, and leaders are concerned about sparking a conflict with Iran, which backs the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.

McKenzie said regional escalation does not “inevitably” follow an American military response to the Houthis. Iran does not fully control the Houthis — or Lebanese Hezbollah — and because it fears retaliation from Israel, it does not want to escalate the conflict.

“I think you can respond to the Houthis without feeling that you are attacking Iran because of the divergence in the Iranian and Houthi positions,” McKenzie said. “One of the most interesting things about the current conflict in Gaza has been the dogs that haven’t barked: Iran, and Lebanese Hezbollah.”

By contrast, McKenzie believes Iran and its proxies will only respect a show of force.

“There’s a fine line between avoiding escalation and inviting continued opportunities for Iranian and Houthi attacks, based on a perceived fecklessness on our part,” McKenzie said. “We’re struggling to get that line right, right now. I would argue that, again, they respect the use of force and understand it and will respond to it.”

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Thursday that the U.S. does not want to widen the conflict into a regional war.

“We’re not in an armed conflict with the Houthis,” Singh said, noting that Austin sent two carrier strike groups and other weapons to the region after Oct. 7 to deter further violence after the Hamas attack in Israel. “We do not want to see this war or a war widen into a regional conflict, and we will continue to respond, should our commanders of our ships feel the need to in self-defense.”

McKenzie is not the only former senior U.S military official who believes President Joe Biden should strike back more forcefully against Iran-backed proxies. Retired Vice Adm. John Miller, the former commander of U.S. 5th Fleet, told POLITICO last week “we are not taking this seriously.”

“We’re not deterring anybody right now,” said Miller, who oversaw all U.S. naval activities in the Middle East until 2022.

McKenzie’s and Miller’s comments reflect the views of a group of U.S. military officials still at Central Command. Some officers believe the only way to stop the attacks is to hit back at the Houthis, said one U.S. official with knowledge of the debate, who was granted anonymity to speak about internal discussions.

McKenzie pointed to the events of 2019 and 2020, when escalating tensions between Iran and the U.S. over President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal culminated in the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military commander, in an American drone strike.

“We had opportunities to demonstrate to Iran that their behavior would not be tolerated. And we didn’t do it, eventually leading to what happened in January of 2020, which I would argue could have been averted,” McKenzie said, urging the Biden time now to take “judicious action in the short-term” to prevent “a larger problem in the long-term.”

McKenzie argued that the approach has worked to a certain extent in recent days in Iraq and Syria, where U.S. ground troops have been under continued attack since October. On Sunday, U.S. forces in Iraq struck a group of militants preparing to launch a drone at their positions, killing five militia members.

After that, the violence slowed for a few days. But on Thursday and Friday there was another uptick, with Iran-backed groups launching four new attacks on American troops in Iraq and Syria, according to two DOD officials who were granted anonymity to speak ahead of an announcement.

In total, Iran-backed proxies have attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria 82 times since Oct. 17, injuring at least 66 service members.

Iranian leaders take notice when the U.S. kills militants — and they also notice when the U.S. deliberately picks targets that are not significant and do not cause casualties, McKenzie said. Biden’s initial response was to send fighter jets to destroy weapons facilities linked to the militia groups, hitting infrastructure but killing no militants.

“Iran respects the use of force — they know and understand it,” McKenzie said. “They have always, always had a very high regard for our capability; they have always doubted our will to employ it.”

While McKenzie said officials at Central Command have undoubtedly provided a number of target options to the commanders, there are some limitations. Typically Iranian military leadership “goes to ground when these escalatory spirals start,” so it’s difficult to find them.

The U.S. is also sensitive about striking targets in Iraq, so as not to “further inflame the internal political environment.” He noted that ultimately, the decision to hit back is made by political leaders, not the combatant commander.

But if the U.S. does not deter the attacks, the Houthis could ramp up the level of violence, McKenzie said, pointing to the possibility of the group planting sea mines as “a new and fresh danger.”

“If they’re attacking us, attempting to hurt and kill Americans, then our response should be of the scope and scale that will discourage them from doing that in the future,” he said.

Top Biden administration officials said they are discussing forming a new international maritime task force, under which U.S. and partnered ships could help ensure the safety of commercial ships in the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb strait, the passageway between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

This could be an expansion of the International Maritime Security Construct, which was established in 2019 to respond to Iranian aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, another choke point for commercial maritime traffic that connects the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, McKenzie said. Military officials at Central Command already had plans to do so, if it became necessary, when he was in command, he added.

McKenzie said such an expansion would be effective in deterring further attacks in the Red Sea, if paired with a “signal” to the Houthis that “we’re not going to put up with their nonsense anymore,” he said.",political

"The president of the University of Pennsylvania, M. Elizabeth Magill, resigned on Saturday, four days after her testimony at a congressional hearing in which she seemed to evade the question of whether students who called for the genocide of Jews should be disciplined.

The announcement, in an email sent to the Penn community from Scott L. Bok, the chairman of the board of trustees, followed months of intense pressure from Jewish students, alumni and donors, who claimed that she had not taken their concerns about antisemitism on campus seriously.

”I write to share that President Liz Magill has voluntarily tendered her resignation as President of the University of Pennsylvania,” Mr. Bok wrote, not long before he announced his own resignation.

He included a note from Ms. Magill, who had been Penn’s president since 2022.

“It has been my privilege to serve as president of this remarkable institution,” Ms. Magill wrote. “It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.”",political
"Now that the first few customers have taken delivery of their Tesla Cybertrucks, it’s probably worth taking a closer look at how the price and specs have changed since the original announcement in 2019. After all, a lot has happened since then!

While the truck looks remarkably similar to how it did four years ago, almost nothing else about the production versions is the same. The price, range, and performance have all shifted dramatically — and probably not in the direction most customers would prefer.

A lot has happened since 2019

First of all, the price is more expensive. We’ve known for a while that Tesla wasn’t going to be able to keep to its 2019 price estimates. Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself admitted in 2022 that the Cybertruck’s specs and price “will be different,” citing inflation and other “various issues” that have cropped up in the intervening years.

Let’s start with the performance-oriented Cyberbeast trim, since that’s the one we have the most details on. Tesla hasn’t said whether this version will have three electric motors, as promised in 2019, but it’s a fair guess that it does.

Tesla Cybertruck “Cyberbeast,” 2019 vs. 2023 Specs Tri-motor, 2019 Cyberbeast, 2023 Range / Battery extender 500 miles 320 miles / 440 miles + Battery capacity NA 123 kWh Weight NA 6,843 lbs Height 75 inches 70.5 inches Length 231.7 inches 223.7 inches Width (no mirrors / mirrors) 79.9 in / NA 86.6 in / 95 in Bed 6.5 ft NA Cargo 100 cu-ft 120.9 cu-ft Front truck Y Y Onboard power Y 11.6 kW Horsepower up to 800 hp 845 hp Top speed NA 130 mph Torque up 1,000 lb-ft 10,296 lb-ft 0-60mph time 2.9 seconds 2.6 seconds Max towing capacity 14,000 lbs 11,000 lbs Max payload capacity up to 3,500 lbs 2,500 lbs Ground clearance NA 17.44 in in extract mode Displays NA 18.5 in center / 9.4 in rear Wheels NA 20 in Drag coefficient NA 0.34 Base price 60,990 $99,990 Available 2021 2024

So, as you can see, the biggest changes are price — with Tesla charging nearly $40,000 more for this version of the truck — and range. The 500 miles that was quoted in 2019 always seemed somewhat aspirational. And now we know that optional battery extenders will help get the production version part of the way there, with up to 440 miles of range estimated.

The torque appears to be the number that has changed most significantly since 2019. Tesla was originally promising around 1,000 lb-ft, but now the company says the Cyberbeast trim can put out an eye-watering 10,296 lb-ft. That could be due to the active torque vectoring that Musk announced at the event Thursday.

“It has locking differentials, rear torque vectoring,” he said. “And the crazy thing is it’ll do this all in comfort.”

Okay, now let’s look at the all-wheel drive model.

Tesla Cybertruck All-Wheel Drive, 2019 vs 2023 Specs All-wheel drive, 2019 All-wheel drive, 2023 Range / Battery extender 300 miles 340 miles / 470 miles Battery capacity NA 123 kWh Weight NA 6,603 lbs Height 75 in 70.5 in Length 231.7 in 223.7 in Width (no mirrors / mirrors) 79.9 in / NA 86.6 in / 95 in Bed 6.5 ft NA Cargo 100 cu-ft 120.9 cu-ft Front truck Y Y Onboard power NA 11.6 kW Horsepower up to 800 hp 600 hp Top speed NA 112 mph Torque up to 1,000 lb-ft 7,435 lb-ft 0-60mph time 4.5 seconds 4.1 seconds Max towing capacity 10,000 lbs 11,000 lbs Max payload capacity 3,500 lbs 2,500 lbs Ground clearance NA 17.44 in with extract mode Displays NA 18.5 in center / 9.4 in rear Wheels NA 20 in Drag coefficient NA 0.34 Charging NA 250 kW max Charging speed NA up to 136 miles in 15 mins Base price $49,900 $79,990 Available 2022 2024

There are better range estimates on the AWD Cybertruck, and also a heftier price tag. And like the other versions, the production model is slightly shorter and a little more compact than what was first announced in 2019.

And now the model for which we have the least amount of information, the rear-wheel drive Cybertruck.

Tesla Cybertruck Rear-Wheel Drive, 2019 vs. 2023 Specs Rear-wheel drive, 2019 Rear-wheel drive, 2023 Range 250 miles 250 miles Battery capacity NA 123 kWh Weight NA 6,603 lbs Height 75 in 70.5 in Length 231.7 in 223.7 in Width (no mirrors / mirrors) 79.9 in / NA 86.6 in / 95 in Bed 6.5 ft NA Cargo 100 cu-ft 120.9 cu-ft Front truck Y Y Onboard power NA 11.6 kW Horsepower up to 800 hp NA Top speed NA 112 mph Torque up to 1,000 lb-ft NA 0-60mph time under 6.5 seconds 6.5 seconds Max towing capacity 10,000 lbs 7,500 lbs Max payload capacity 3,500 lbs NA Ground clearance NA NA Displays NA NA Wheels NA 20 in Drag coefficient NA 0.34 Charging NA NA Charging speed NA NA Base price $39,900 $60,990 Available 2021 2025

This one’s not coming until 2025, so presumedly even more could change. Tesla will likely have more to announce about the most affordable version of the Cybertruck as we get closer to its actual release date.

So as you can see, Tesla stuck close to some of these numbers, but others turned out way different than we were expecting. It can’t tow as much or carry as much as originally envisioned. And it will cost more — a lot more — than we were told. It retains its polarizing design. And arguably, thanks to Musk’s antics in the last few years, it has become polarizing for entirely new reasons.",technology

BRUSSELS — Eva Kaili and Francesco Giorgi had left nothing to chance.

The duo that would later become the most famous — many would say infamous — couple in the European Union capital had been gearing up for this moment for years.

As Qatar prepared to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, they were among the Gulf state’s fiercest advocates in Brussels, defending its record on human rights and fending off criticism of its treatment of migrant workers.

And now, less than a week before the high-profile soccer tournament was to kick off, it was all coming to a head. At a crucial hearing in the European Parliament, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri — aka “the Doctor” — would come in person to plead his case before the chamber’s human rights committee.

In the preceding days, Kaili, a Greek lawmaker who was then a vice president of the European Parliament, had ramped up her efforts. According to public records, interviews and a cache of investigative files seen by POLITICO, she had flown back and forth to Doha and spent hours pleading and cajoling fellow lawmakers to give Qatar a clean bill of health on human rights.

At several points, she turned to her partner, Giorgi, for advice. “Who else should I talk to?” she texted him on November 14, according to transcriptions of her WhatsApp messages included in the police investigation files.

While Kaili worked the phones, Giorgi, an Italian parliamentary assistant, had been putting the finishing touches to the Qatari minister’s speech. In police surveillance photographs taken three days before the hearing, he can be seen poring over the text with his longtime boss, Pier Antonio Panzeri — a former EU lawmaker who Belgian prosecutors would later describe as the mastermind of a sweeping cash-for-influence operation known as “Qatargate.”

Per their usual working method, the Italian-speaking Panzeri wrote the speech in his native language and then passed it on to Giorgi for translation. With one day to go, Giorgi and Kaili huddled with Al Marri in his suite at the 5-star Steigenberger Wiltcher’s hotel, according to hotel video recordings obtained by the police.

Finally, it was the big day. As the minister took to the stage on November 14, 2022, Kaili nervously texted her partner again to ask if she should show up in person.

“Don’t come,” Giorgi replied via WhatsApp. “I’m afraid you will be exposed. To enter with the baby, everyone will notice u.”

She replied: “I don’t want to be exposed.”

So she stayed with the couple’s child, while the rest of the key suspects in what would become the Qatargate scandal crowded into the auditorium where Al Marri — the man police would later describe as the leader in his country’s efforts to corrupt the European Parliament — was taking to the stage.

If everything went well and Al Marri came out satisfied with their efforts over many months of lobbying, the Italian former lawmaker stood to make good on a long-standing business relationship he and Giorgi would later tell police was worth more than €4 million.

And if it failed? Nobody wanted to know.

As Al Marri spoke, laying out the case for Qatar’s labor reforms and why his country deserved the world’s respect despite reports alleging abuse of migrant laborers, Kaili and her partner of five years WhatsApped back and forth, as one might do while watching a major sporting event from two different locations.

“So Arabic and speaks without reading,” Giorgi texted.

A few minutes later, Kaili commented: “He’s losing it a bit.”

As other lawmakers took to the floor following Al Marri’s speech, she bristled at criticism of Qatar.

“Who is this fat,” she texted her partner, referring to one lawmaker, adding an adjective which to her was an insult: “Communist.”

As Al Marri wrapped up, the Greek lawmaker asked: “Why he didn’t follow the speech.”

Finally, it was over.

Giorgi texted Kaili: “Ela, we did everything we could.”

For the watch party, a major milestone had been crossed. A senior Qatari representative had been given a chance to address criticism in what could have been a fiercely critical environment.

So far, so good. Except what they didn’t know was that Giorgi and Panzeri had been under surveillance by Belgian secret services for months, suspected of taking part in a sweeping cash-for-influence scheme under which Qatar paid to obtain specific legislative outcomes. Their communications, including with Kaili and other suspects, would be scooped up as part of the wiretaps and the subsequent investigations.

Kaili denies any wrongdoing in a scheme in which police say Panzeri and others accepted money from Qatar, Morocco and Mauritania in exchange for pushing their interests in the European Parliament. Kaili maintains her defense of Qatar was part of her job as a representative of the European Union and that the investigation into her actions breached the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by sitting MEPs.

There is no other evidence in the hundreds of pages of wiretapping by the secret services that indicates Kaili directly received money from Qatar or other countries. Giorgi has provided details of the operation to police, but his lawyer has argued his statements were extracted under duress.

And yet, as the pro-Qatar operation turned to its next challenges, Belgian investigators who had taken over the probe from the secret service were closing in.

On the morning of December 9, the trap slammed shut. Kaili, Giorgi, Panzeri and a couple of other suspects were arrested and thrown into jail on charges of corruption, money laundering and participating in a “criminal conspiracy.” Two other members of the European Parliament, Marc Tarabella and Andrea Cozzolino, would also be arrested and charged.

Police published photographs of bags stuffed full of hundreds of thousands of euros which they had recovered in Panzeri’s flat, at Kaili and Giorgi’s home and in a suitcase wheeled by Kaili’s father — instantly turning their probe into a page one news story for outlets around the Continent.

* * *

The shock arrests of one of the highest-ranking members of the European Parliament, her boyfriend and their alleged accomplices smashed open a window onto a murky world of lobbying for foreign governments in the heart of EU democracy.

The Brussels bubble, as the EU’s policymaking apparatus is known, likes to think of itself as a global paragon of democracy, transparency and respect for human rights. There’s another side of the EU capital, however — an ecosystem of hidden connections and low-grade corruption, of back-scratching politicians and the filter feeders that gravitate toward centers of political power and public largesse.

While the Qatargate case has yet to go to court and several of the key players, including Kaili, insist they are innocent of the charges, the scandal has already led to reforms. The European Parliament has introduced changes bolstering transparency, and the creation of an ethics body establishing common standards for EU civil servants is being negotiated.

The story of Qatargate is also still being written. And nobody better captures the human element of this complex affair — and the cozy, transactional world in which it took place — than Kaili and Giorgi.

Start with Kaili: A political celebrity in her native Greece, where she’d gained fame as a TV presenter, at the time of her arrest she was one of Brussels’ most prominent politicians, widely believed to be bound for higher office either within the EU system or back home. She’d recently had her first child with Giorgi, an ambitious parliamentary assistant nine years her junior whose wavy blond hair and dimpled smile were well known in the European Parliament.

Together, they formed a formidable power couple on the Brussels circuit — as well as a shining example of what Europeans hailing from their respective Mediterranean homelands can achieve in the EU system if they play their cards right.

And yet, in an instant, it was all over. Both of them were in jail, their reputations in tatters, their infant child outside and in the care of family members. In the space of a single morning, the EU capital’s golden couple had become the most notorious duo in town.

Pier Antonio Panzeri hired Francesco Giorgi as an intern in 2009 | European Union

To understand what propelled this sudden plunge, it helps to dial back the clock to the earliest days of their relationship, five years before anyone heard of the so-called Qatargate scandal.

It was a Monday in early 2017. Giorgi was at work doing a familiar task — interpreting for his language-challenged boss, Pier Antonio Panzeri, at a conference in Parliament.

The two men went back a long way. Panzeri had been Giorgi’s boss for nearly a decade already, having hired him first as an intern in 2009 and then as a full-blown accredited assistant. The elder Italian was a well-known politician in Parliament — a shrewd operator on the left wing of Italy’s Partito Democratico, a trade union veteran from Milan who turned to international affairs late in his 15-year parliamentary career.

But he was a man of his generation — only really comfortable speaking in Italian and, according to Giorgi, unable to switch on a computer.

For all of those things, there was Giorgi. Then aged around 30, he was in a good place professionally and socially. Like thousands of Italians who flock to Brussels every year, he looked to the EU system as a land of opportunity. And the system had served him well. Paid handsomely, he had a front-row seat on his boss’s dealings, which included travel to places like Rabat, Morocco and Doha, Qatar, as well as more mundane tasks.

But nearly 10 years in, Giorgi was ready for change. And little did he know, the embodiment of that change was about to walk in the door.

While Kaili and Giorgi had seen each other in the halls of the European Parliament a few times since her election in 2014, according to her interviews with Belgian police, that Monday meeting in Brussels would stick out for them as their first proper encounter.

The mutual interest must have been powerful because it’s hard to overstate the disparity, in terms of age and political and financial power, that separated Giorgi from Kaili as she walked in, heading a NATO delegation.

To put it bluntly, Giorgi was a cog in the machine with no political weight. By contrast, Kaili was already a well-established politician in Brussels and very well plugged-in with Greece’s political and business elite. She had barreled her way up through the ranks of the Greek socialist party, PASOK, while still in her twenties, before making the jump to the European Parliament in 2014. In her office, Kaili employed no fewer than three Giorgis.

And yet the young Italian, who’d grown up sailing in the Mediterranean and skiing in the French Alps, decided to try his luck. According to Kaili’s testimony to police, after this initial encounter, the two of them dined “two or three times.” Giorgi spent the better part of a year trying to woo the Greek lawmaker, but it was tough going as she claimed to be far too busy with her work to carve out time for a serious relationship.

It was only after about a year, she said, that things became “serious.” Marking the transition from casual dating to partnership, they made a shared commitment: co-investing in an apartment located just behind their shared place of work, the European Parliament. It was Christmas Eve, 2019, according to Giorgi’s statements to police.

After Kaili returned to Greece in 2019 to campaign for reelection, Giorgi joined her a few months later. In February 2021, they were joined by a baby girl.

But that’s where their story departs from the norm. Most wage-earning couples don’t live surrounded by stacks of cash. Most EU bubble couples don’t possess a “go bag” brimming with bank notes, or end up as suspects in sprawling corruption probes.

Part of the explanation can be found in their link to Panzeri, the Svengali-like third wheel in their relationship, whom Giorgi described initially as a “father figure” and whom Kaili later called a manipulator taking advantage of her boyfriend’s “idealistic” personality.

Indeed, in his interviews with Belgian investigators, Giorgi traces back the “original sin” of his involvement in Qatargate to a deal he agreed to with Panzeri shortly after becoming his employee in 2009. Under that arrangement, Giorgi allegedly agreed to pay Panzeri back €1,500 per month of his wages in exchange for the privilege of working for him, a relatively common scheme in the Parliament. (As a point of comparison, when the scandal broke, Giorgi was earning some €6,600 per month as an assistant to a different MEP).

The deal was to prove an introduction to a transactional world in which Panzeri — as a lawmaker and later, as the head of Fight Impunity, a nongovernmental organization he launched after leaving Parliament — had no trouble accepting large sums of cash from foreign governments in exchange for services rendered.

From 2018, Giorgi and Panzeri dove headlong into a partnership allegedly based on lobbying for Qatar in exchange for big cash payments. According to Giorgi’s statements to police, they agreed on a long-term lobbying agreement worth an estimated €4.5 million and to be split 60/40, with the larger share going to Panzeri.

Once arrested, Giorgi and Panzeri would butt heads about the precise role of each in the lobbying arrangement. But one of the younger Italian’s key tasks was to pick up cash payments at various places around Brussels, often from total strangers. Once he picked up €300,000 in cash near the Royal Palace from a person driving a black Audi with Dutch license plates. Another time, the drop-off happened in a parking lot near the canal.

In total, there were around ten such drop-offs, two or three per year, with the smallest amount around €50,000.

The alleged quid pro quo was that Giorgi and Panzeri would deliver specific parliamentary and public relations outcomes to their clients, which in addition to Qatar included Morocco and Mauritania. The ever-meticulous Giorgi kept a spreadsheet on his computer on which he documented hundreds of influence activities that the network allegedly carried out between 2018 and 2022.

It records more than 300 pieces of work, using a network of aides inside parliament whom they called their “soldiers,” according to the files.

Even as they pressed their clients’ interests, they were also trying to exploit their lack of familiarity with the workings of the bubble, reporting certain actions that, according to Giorgi, they actually had no influence over.

The scheme, Giorgi later told police, “relied on the ignorance of how parliament works” — on the part of the duo’s clients.

Panzeri, through his lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

As Giorgi dug deeper into his partnership with Panzeri, his romance with Kaili was expanding into a business partnership.

While each already had other properties — including Kaili’s two apartments in Athens (which she said were worth a combined €400,000) and one in Brussels (estimated by Kaili at €160,000) and one belonging to Giorgi purchased for €145,000 in Brussels — they were soon eyeing other purchases.

After the Christmas Eve purchase of their flat near the Parliament for €375,000 in 2019, they purchased a plot of land on the Greek island of Paros for €300,000 in 2021 which they planned to develop into four holiday villas and at least one swimming pool, according to files recovered from Giorgi’s computer in a folder called “Business”. Then, in 2022, came the purchase of their second apartment, a penthouse right next to the Parliament, worth €650,000, according to Giorgi’s statements to police.

All told, the couple’s joint real estate purchases amounted to more than €1.3 million over a period of two years.

In between these purchases, there were other expenses: sailing holidays, a Land Rover bought for €56,000 and a fully refurbished kitchen. On several occasions, the couple sought to minimize their outlay by exploiting their insiders’ knowledge of the system.

According to documents seized at Giorgi’s home, a Qatari diplomat helped him get a discount on the Land Rover by taking advantage of special conditions for diplomatic staff, reducing the sticker price by about €10,000.

By any normal standards, Kaili and Giorgi were already wealthy based on their income.

In addition to taking home €6,600 per month as a parliamentary assistant, Giorgi received €1,000 in social benefits for their daughter, €1,800 per month from the rental to the Mauritanian ambassador and — since the envoy never occupied the flat — €1,200 in cash from two women to whom he sublet the flat for a few months.

As for Kaili, she earned about €10,000 before taxes plus about €900 in monthly rent from a flat she owned in Brussels.

All told, the couple was pulling in well over €20,000 per month, an eye-watering amount in a country where the median monthly wage is €3,507 before taxes.

Yet even these substantial monthly earnings seem not to have covered the mounting costs related to their real estate investments or make the couple feel fully secure. Despite the fact her partner was pulling in more than three times the Belgian median wage, Kaili would tell police during the first interview after her arrest: “I know that Francesco doesn’t have a lot of money because he isn’t able to partake in all of our expenses.”

What motivated this drive for accumulation? According to a person who knew Kaili professionally and asked not to be named due to fear of retaliation, the answer lies partly in her background growing up without much money in Thessaloniki, Greece. “It feels like she grew up with a lot of deprivations,” the person said. “She wanted to feel that even if she quits politics, she will have a comfortable life.”

As a result, Kaili tended to be very focused on financial opportunities. “She loved people with power and money. She was always, ‘You know this event is going to have businessmen,’” the person added. “And she always liked to have houses and property stuff, but she was never into luxury stuff.”

As for Giorgi, the son of a school director and import-export entrepreneur, he grew up in more comfortable circumstances in a town near Milan.

But as the junior partner in his relationship with Kaili, he may have struggled to keep up financially with a partner who earned more than he did and kept company with wealthy entrepreneurs and crypto bros.

“I have never loved luxury. I don’t know why I lost my way,” he told police during his first interview shortly after his arrest.

In interviews with police, Giorgi admitted to being part of a scheme, with Panzeri, to take hundreds of thousands of euros in cash from foreign governments — admissions his lawyer now says he made under pressure from police who he says threatened to take away his daughter.

But Kaili always maintained that she had nothing to do with the setup. Not only does she claim ignorance about the ultimate source of much of the money found in her apartment, and on her father; she also told police that she had nothing to do with Panzeri and Giorgi’s deals with foreign governments — an argument that her partner has always backed up, telling police early on that she had nothing to do with the scheme.

Panzeri, however, says the opposite. He alleges that in the spring of 2019, Kaili was part of a pact struck with Qatar to fund several MEPs’ election campaigns to the tune of €250,000 each. Giorgi and Panzeri both attest that a deal like this took place — but disagree on whether Kaili was involved.

In any case, having forged a reputation as a tech policymaker, Kaili’s work as a lawmaker veered suddenly toward the Middle East and the world of human rights, particularly in the Gulf, from 2017 onwards the year she met Giorgi. She traveled to Qatar for the first time later that year, at the invitation of another lawmaker, and made trips — some with Giorgi, some without — in 2020 and 2022.

In early 2022, just after she became a Parliament vice president, she asked the chamber’s president, Roberta Metsola, to give her files related to the Middle East and human rights. “I hope I didn’t make it difficult for you,” Kaili WhatsApped Metsola. “You gave me everything I love the most!” She was later designated as the vice president who would replace Metsola in her absence on issues related to the Middle East.

In the days and weeks leading up to the kickoff of the World Cup, Kaili and Giorgi’s work increasingly overlapped on two main files: opposition to a resolution critical of Qatar and a deal Doha was seeking with the EU that would allow its citizens to travel to the bloc without a visa.

On November 12, two days before Qatar’s labor minister would appear before the European Parliament, she reached out to Metsola, offering her tickets to the tournament in Doha.

“My dear President!” she wrote to Metsola. “Hope you are well. I have to pass you an invitation for the World Cup, you [sic] or your husband and boys might be interested,” she wrote on WhatsApp.

It’s not clear what, if anything, Kaili asked from Metsola in exchange for the tickets. Throughout her dealings with lawmakers over Qatar, the Greek lawmaker would occasionally delete the messages she had sent. This includes her side of the rest of the conversation with Metsola — except for one text: “The rest I disagree too but I believe they will digest if we get the visa,” she wrote.

(A spokesperson for the Parliament president said Metsola never accepted any tickets to the World Cup and did not read Kaili’s messages before they were deleted.)

With the World Cup having started, the next big challenge awaiting Kaili, Giorgi and Panzeri was a plenary session in Strasbourg where rival politicians aimed to criticize Qatar’s human rights record weeks before the World Cup by putting a resolution on the agenda. Once again, they ramped up their lobbying.

So noticeable was the pro-Qatari line being pushed by Kaili and others affiliated with Panzeri that it started raising eyebrows among their colleagues.

“There were some very strange opinions being voiced on how we should not criticize Qatar, and we should rather recognize the reforms they were making and so on,” remembered Niels Fuglsang, a Danish MEP from the same S&D group. “I thought it was obvious that our group should criticize this, we are social democrats, we care about workers’ rights and migrants’ rights.”

For example, on November 21, Kaili pressed José Ramón Bauzá Díaz, a Spanish centrist MEP who ran the Qatari-EU friendship group, over his political faction’s stance on the resolution, poised to slam Qatar’s human rights track record.

“So, your group wants to vote in favor of a resolution Against Qatar World Cup,” she WhatsApped to him. He said: “It is crazy.” She went on to press him to take a pro-Qatari stance and reject the resolution.

Later that day, in a now-infamous video, Kaili took to the stage during Parliament’s plenary session and sung the praises of Qatar. “I alone said that Qatar is a front-runner in labor rights,” she said. “Still, some here are calling to discriminate them. They bully them and they accuse everyone that talks to them, or engages, of corruption. But still, they take their gas.”

With a crunch vote on the resolution’s final wording still to take place on November 24, Kaili was still going strong, texting with Abdulaziz bin Ahmed Al Malki, the Gulf country’s envoy to the European Union and NATO.

During this exchange, the Qatari gave Kaili direct instructions to take action on legislation of interest to Qatar.

“Hi Iva,” wrote the Qatari in a WhatsApp message on November 24. “My dear my ministry doesn’t want paragraph A about FIFA & Qatar. Please do your best to remove it via voting before 12 noon or during the voting please.”

Kaili deleted her responses.

But the recipient appeared to be pleased with what she texted, writing back a few hours later: “Thanks excellency” with a hands-clasped-in-prayer emoji.

The Qatar Embassy in Brussels and the spokesperson’s office in Doha did not respond to requests for comment.

Plainclothes Belgian police arrested Giorgi at 10:42 a.m. on December 9 at his home in Brussels. Earlier, they had picked up Panzeri. According to her statements to police, Kaili did not immediately know what had happened and originally thought Giorgi was involved in a car accident. She was told by police that her partner had been arrested.

Having tried and failed to get through by phone to Panzeri and his friends, Kaili set about trying to get rid of the stacks of cash in her apartment.

She headed to the safe that Giorgi had installed in their apartment and started to shovel stacks of bills into a travel bag. On top of them, she placed baby bottles for her child as well as a mobile phone and a laptop computer. Then she told her father, a civil engineer and sometime political operator who was visiting the family in Brussels, to take the bag and go to a hotel, where her father’s partner and Kaili’s baby were waiting. “I didn’t leave him the choice,” she later told police. “I just said, ‘Take this and go.’”

A few hours later, police followed Kaili’s father as he walked to the Sofitel, a short distance from their flat. According to a person familiar with the details of the investigation, bank notes were fluttering out of the bag as he went. Cops stopped Kaili’s father inside the hotel, seized the suitcase and detained him. Then it was Kaili’s turn. In the early afternoon, police detained her and took her to the Prison de Saint-Gilles.

The next day, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) announced it was investigating Kaili and another Greek member of Parliament in a probe looking at whether she took kickbacks from her assistant’s salaries as well as cuts of their reimbursements for “fake” work trips. Kaili has challenged the lifting of her immunity in this case at the European Court of Justice.

As the one-year anniversary of her spectacular downfall has approached, Kaili and her lawyers have done their best to turn the tables on the prosecutors, casting doubt on the evidence gathered against her and the way the investigation was carried out. Since her arrest, and through a four-month incarceration, Kaili has never wavered from her story. Her advocacy for Qatar, she has argued, was just part of her job as a European politician trying to foster ties with a petroleum-rich country in a region of critical importance to the EU.

Kaili’s lawyers have argued that the testimony provided by Panzeri, who has struck a deal with investigators and confessed in detail, cannot be trusted. Giorgi’s lawyer, Pierre Monville, has maintained his client’s statements were made under duress. “Whatever Giorgi has declared or written during his detention was under extreme pressure and preoccupation regarding the fact that his daughter was left without her parents,” he said.

Kaili’s lawyers have also noted that police kept Panzeri and Giorgi in the same cell in the days after their detention, giving them a chance to coordinate their stories. Kaili’s lawyers argue she was subjected to illegal surveillance, arbitrary detention and what amounts to “torture” while in jail.

The Qatargate suspects won a major victory last summer when the lead investigator, Michel Claise, stepped down over conflict-of-interest concerns after it was revealed that his son was in business with the son of an MEP who was close to Panzeri but hasn’t been arrested or charged.

Then, in September, Kaili played the ace up her sleeve, throwing the entire investigation in doubt with a legal challenge arguing that the evidence against her should be ruled inadmissible because it was gathered before the European Parliament voted to lift the immunity she enjoyed as a lawmaker.

Prosecutors retort that such a step wasn’t needed because Kaili had been caught red-handed by her decision to send her father out with a suitcase full of cash, but the case has been delayed pending a decision on her challenge by an appeals court expected in the middle of next year.

“We’re exploring uncharted legal territory here,” said a person familiar with the case, who requested anonymity as they were not allowed to speak on the record. In the meantime, Kaili is back in Parliament, giving interviews to international media and losing few opportunities to make the case for her innocence to her fellow lawmakers.

Giorgi and Kaili are, by all accounts, living together again. One of her lawyers says they’ve been given dispensation to do so, despite the fact that they are suspects in the same case.

Kaili and Giorgi declined to comment for this article, but they clearly haven’t given up the fight. Giorgi’s WhatsApp status is “FORTITUDINE VINCIMUS” — through endurance, we conquer.

Kaili’s profile pic on the app features the famous quote often wrongly attributed to Mahatma Gandhi:

“First they ignore you.

Then they laugh at you.

Then they fight you.

Then you win.”",political
"To the Editor:

Re “The Startling Evidence on Learning Loss Is In” (editorial, Nov. 19):

Bah humbug! American children suffered from “learning loss” before Covid. In 2019, 35 percent of fourth graders read at or above grade level, 41 percent in math. Hardly impressive. Moreover, we don’t test for skills employers care about — collaboration, communication, critical thinking and creative innovation.

The science of how brains learn might help us refashion school for the 21st century. Students don’t learn well sitting passively in large classes memorizing facts to be regurgitated. Students learn in active, engaged, meaningful and socially interactive classrooms.

Teachers know this. We can teach required curriculums in richer ways that spark deeper learning. Want increased student attendance and more engaged learning? Let teachers create active, joyful classrooms. School does not have to be boring.

"Microsoft is cooking up a next-gen Windows – and it may not be called Windows 12 – with some huge new AI tricks, according to a new report.

This comes from Zac Bowden at Windows Central, one of the more prolific Windows leakers out there – and a good source for rumors in our experience – who has plenty to say about what Microsoft is planning to do with AI in the next version of Windows for 2024 (which is codenamed Hudson Valley).

Some heavy-duty work is planned to integrate AI throughout the Windows interface more deeply, bringing in a whole load of features, some of which are described as “groundbreaking”. According to Bowden’s sources, the cornerstone of this work will be an AI-powered Windows Shell.

This will benefit from an ‘advanced Copilot’ AI that’s constantly working away in the background, looking at your searches and what you’re doing, trying to understand the context and help appropriately.

Some examples are given, such as being able to use more natural language in a search in Windows, like “find me that file Karen sent to me on WhatsApp earlier this week.”

There will also be a timeline feature that allows you to scroll back through all your recent app and website usage which Copilot records, and you can search within that for any term.

We’re also told to expect an AI-supercharged version of Live Captions, capable of translating to multiple different languages in real-time, not just for video (or audio) playback, but also on a live video chat.

The slight catch is that some AI features will require NPU hardware – a Neural Processing Unit which is a partner chip for the CPU/GPU, one that specializes in accelerating AI tasks – and those will be more heavyweight capabilities. One example given is AI-powered upscaling of the image quality of videos or indeed games.

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

Bowden also contends that we could even get fancy wallpapers driven by AI, and indeed we’ve heard leaks previously about backgrounds that will use a parallax effect – one that interacts with the cursor, or gyroscope in Windows devices that have one, and looks like it’s popping out of your screen.

Away from AI – which will be the major focus of next-gen Windows, though we’d already guessed that – Microsoft is also planning changes to the interface. That includes a ‘Creator’ panel for the Start menu and File Explorer, which will be a hub for launching anything related to content creation in Windows. Bowden describes it as a kind of ‘launchpad for Microsoft 365’ bristling with shortcuts to your latest Word documents, PowerPoints, and so forth.

Furthermore, there’s even talk of shifting around bits of the core layout of the desktop, like putting the system tray (bottom-right) at the top of the screen – but more radical moves like this are likely for the future, not next year.

Finally, another major enhancement for next-gen Windows will come to energy saver (recently spotted in testing), with Microsoft seemingly looking at beefing up battery life by up to 50% in certain scenarios – which would be huge for laptop owners. And apparently, a new ‘green power’ option will be capable of detecting when the electricity it’s being fed from the socket is derived from renewable sources, and it’ll initiate charging if that’s the case. Pretty nifty.

When might we get all – or at least some – of these goodies? Bowden reckons that Microsoft is aiming to complete work on next-gen Windows in August 2024, and it’ll be rolled out around September or October, the typical time the big annual update is expected to arrive.

As we said at the outset, Bowden is also somewhat doubtful about whether this next version of Microsoft’s desktop OS will be Windows 12 – and we’ve already been discussing that in-depth elsewhere this morning (plus there’s some juicy new info on changes Microsoft is apparently planning for the release cadence of Windows).

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

Analysis: Game-changing possibilities

This is just talk – chatter from the rumor mill – so we must apply the usual skepticism, and consider that some of it might be fanciful, wishful thinking. But it does sound like AI really will make a big difference to the next incarnation of Windows.

Having a search function that allows for more natural use of language – “find those images I put on Google Drive from that Microsoft press kit last month” – would be hugely powerful. Not having to remember the exact name of a file you’re hunting out will be a huge boon in itself. (And hopefully, we can avoid Copilot inquiring: “Oh, and by the way, why aren’t you using OneDrive?”).

There are several game-changing possibilities mentioned here, like real-time captions delivered for video chatting with multiple language options. And in a very literal sense, NPU-powered upscaling for games could be very useful where Nvidia’s or AMD’s upscaling tech isn’t present, or supported – and it’ll be great for videos and watching Netflix, or your preferred streaming service, on your PC too.

What isn’t mentioned here, and would seem to be an obvious avenue of potential improvement, is Voice Access. Powering up speech recognition tech with AI seems like a way to make next-gen Windows truly innovative – Voice Access has already come a long way (since incorporating Dragon’s excellent tech), but surely there’s scope for AI to make it all the more powerful. And for spoken conversations with Copilot to become the norm, with no typing needed, and no misinterpretation.

In recent times, accessibility has been an area Microsoft has been laudably keen to make improvements with, and surely that theme will continue with AI helping to push the boundaries therein.",technology
"“Did you learn things in CIA training about withstanding interrogation that are going to make it harder for me to interview you?” I asked Joe Weisberg, creator of the TV espionage drama The Americans and onetime CIA agent. He looked momentarily startled, as though he’d expected this to be easier. Good, I had him where I wanted him: off-balance. I saw him taking my measure. Then he laughed affably, but I mistrusted the affability, since I knew from his own books that affability is among the qualities the CIA recruits for: people who can get other people to trust them, or at least want to have lunch with them.

I suppose I had certain fantasies about interviewing an ex-spook (was he equally profiling me? more skillfully?), no doubt the result of having read too many John le Carré novels. As it happens, reading le Carré had a lot to do with propelling Weisberg himself to spycraft. Sure, he knew it was a fantasy world being depicted, but it was still a world he felt he belonged in. There was also his consuming obsession with bringing down the Soviet Union, which unfortunately for his career aspirations was soon to collapse on its own.

Weisberg, who is 57 and on the short side, has a sharp, possibly even hawkish visage along with an invitingly squishy-liberal midsection, which in combination externalize the essential duality in his being, one that’s both shaped his life story to date and yielded one of the most complex married couples in television history, the Russian sleeper agents Elizabeth and Philip Jennings. The Americans aired on FX from 2013 to 2018, but everyone I know seems to be compulsively binge-streaming it lately—maybe the fear that your neighbors are plotting to bring down democracy somehow resonates again with the mental state of the country? Loosely based on the FBI’s 2010 arrest of a network of Soviet spies living under assumed identities in the US, the series springs at least as much from the depths of Weisberg’s psyche. Elizabeth, a cold warrior to her core, is, Weisberg says semi-jokingly, him pre-therapy; the détente-curious Philip is him after.

Therapy also figures significantly in his more recent limited-run series, The Patient, created with his writing partner Joel Fields (they were showrunners together on both series) and starring Steve Carell as a shrink horribly unlucky in his clientele. Something haunts me about both these shows, and not just because they feel like case studies in American paranoia. At a time when most scripted television specializes in moral preening—trafficking in sentimentality, pandering to liberal do-gooderism, leaving us feeling better about ourselves and the world—Weisberg’s shows put you through a merciless psychological and spiritual wringer. They’re willing to leave you floundering.

So what about those interrogation-evading techniques? I pressed Weisberg. We were chatting in his downtown apartment, the top two floors of a century-old building—gracious entryway, high-ceilinged rooms, also a rental and steep third-floor walkup with an inoperable buzzer. (“Joe doesn't have fancy taste, he’s not acquisitive, he's not super interested in money,” says his brother, Jacob.) Decorative touches include his late mother’s porcelain eggcup collection, a row of family photos (some “off the record”—Weisberg is divorced and has a teenage daughter), the residues of successive hobbies—photography, painting, cooking—and a wall of serious-looking books. The vestibule is devoted to an extensive high-tech backpack collection: his only consumerist passion is an unequivocally nerdy one.

What I really wanted to know was what he’d learned about getting inside people’s heads—knowing what your adversaries are thinking, using their desires against them. It’s what’s so seductive about le Carré: his operatives aren’t just spies, they’re master psychological strategists. As are Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, always knowing the precise right play: who’s dissembling, where’s the weak spot. Does CIA training give you a leg up at that kind of thing in later life? Does it make you better at grasping dark human complexities, thus at writing layered and contradictory characters?",technology
"Sharvan Patel’s Instagram account is a window into daily life in the vast deserts of western India: children fighting calves for camel milk, a grandmother drying pickles on top of a mud house, or a farmer eating under the only tree in a barren land. Patel’s passion for wildlife conservation has attracted more than 318,000 followers to his account, where he tells the story of the intricate binding of the Indigenous cultures with the ecosystem in the Thar desert. Sometimes, he also tells people who to vote for in upcoming elections.

In one of Patel’s posts from August, which has been played over 4.7 million times, dozens of women, from young to old, line up to get a smartphone under a government scheme. “Today, this mother has gotten a smartphone,” a woman says, pointing toward a frail woman. “She had never thought that Ashok Gehlot would give her the smartphone that her son could never get her.”

Gehlot is the chief minister of Rajasthan, standing for reelection in the state in late November. Patel is one of dozens of influencers hired by marketing firms working for the Congress Party and its main rival, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, as politicians look to use the vast reach of social media personalities. In October, Patel’s Instagram reached 30 million people. “My posts reach everyone from a government official to a laborer in half an hour,” he says. He charges nearly $100 per post. “It is not only advertising; that’s something politicians can do themselves. We create content that makes people believe that something nice is actually happening. It doesn't look like we are promoting a political party—the post only shows a good, positive picture.”

From fluffy interviews on YouTube podcasts with millions of subscribers to subliminal attacks on Instagram Reels, the political parties in India are betting big on influencers to swing voting patterns, manage crises, and help them secure power as the world’s largest democracy gears up for state elections this month, and a national election in 2024. It’s a strategy that makes sense—622 million Indians are online, and with the cost of internet access falling, people from India’s harder-to-reach hinterlands are coming online fast. Two-thirds of the population lives in these areas, giving them enormous power to sway the results of national elections. And while the symbiotic relationship between political campaigns and influencers has allowed politicians to reach the electorate in new ways, and to influence how they vote, it’s also helped them to dodge media scrutiny during public engagement and to challenge the integrity of elections in India.",technology

Hi, I'm Maddie Ziegler,

and this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.

[upbeat music]

This is so weird.

I've, like, watched these videos,

so now, like, holding it in person is really funny.

[upbeat music]

What is Maddie Ziegler's job?

I am a dancer and an actor

and a few other things in between. [laughs]

What brand does Maddie Ziegler own?

I don't own a brand.

I'm, like, trying to think.

No, I don't own a brand, but not for long.

No, I'm just kidding. I don't know. [laughs]

Hopefully, I'll own a brand in the future.

What is Maddie Ziegler signature move?

I feel like it's changed throughout the years.

I think when I was younger, I did this switch leap,

which I feel like if anyone has seen it

on the show that I was on growing up.

But I think what became more signature was

when I, like, pulled my eye in the Chandelier dance.

I did, like, a thing like that in behind the curtain.

I feel like that was, like, a signature thing.

What makes Maddie Ziegler unique in the dance world?

My emotion and the way

that I have used characters in my different dance pieces

is what made me stand out to Sia

and why I got that job in the first place.

[board taps]

Who was Maddie Ziegler in 'Pretty Little Liars'?

Oh my gosh, that is such a flashback.

I don't even know if I had a character name.

I was like a ghost or a spirit or something.

That was truly, at the time,

one of the best days of my life

because I was such a Pretty Little Liars fan.

What has Maddie Ziegler been in?

I would say more recently,

you would know me for maybe a film called The Fallout

that I did,

or I have a new film coming out called Fitting In.

West Side Story.

What is Maddie Ziegler favorite song?

That's like asking a mom to pick her favorite child,

I feel like.

I don't know if you could do that.

I feel like a song that's on heavy rotation

is Sweet Thing by Mary J. Blige.

She didn't originate the song I don't think,

but I think it's her cover.

Maddie Ziegler Velma dance scene.

I played Velma in West Side Story

and we got to perform the iconic dance at the gym scene

from the original film,

and it was such an incredible moment.

It was obviously directed by Steven Spielberg,

and it was choreographed by Justin Peck.

And I was so lucky to work with both of them.

I think six or seven days

to film just that one dance scene.

It was a huge production.

What makeup does Maddie Ziegler,

I'm scared where this is going, use?

Oh, I use so many different brands of makeup.

I think there's so many different,

amazing products for different things.

I think Charlotte Tilbury is great.

Saie Beauty is great. Hourglass.

I have a bunch of different favorites, for sure.

What is Maddie Ziegler Zodiac sign?

I'm a Libra.

I'm, like, not super into science,

but when people who are

and they know that I'm a Libra,

they're like, That makes so much sense.

Traits of a Libra are are just, like,

super go-with-the-flow,

pretty calm, indecisive, which I'm all those things.

When did Maddie Ziegler start dancing?

I started dancing when I was two years old,

and I started competitively dancing when I was four,

so real early.

When was Maddie Ziegler on 'Dancing With the Stars'?

That was weird.

I did not know that was gonna happen.

I performed on Dancing With the Stars a few times.

I did a performance with Sia

and Allison Holker, who's an incredible dancer.

And then I think I performed with Josh Groban on there.

And then I also did a performance with my sister

when she was on Dancing With the Stars: Junior.

I did a little guest trio performance,

and it was so much fun.

Oh, I also did another performance with Alan and Alexis Ren.

All of the pro dancers on the show are incredible.

I think Val and Jenna, they're a married couple,

and they're absolutely incredible.

I would love to train with both of them.

[board taps]

Is Maddie Ziegler on 'Masked Dancer'?

Wrong Ziegler.

My sister was, but I wasn't.

Does Maddie Ziegler like Jenna Ortega?

I love Jenna Ortega.

She's one of my greatest friends,

and she's a little angel, and I adore her.

I adore working with her,

but I also just adore our friendship,

and I think it's really special.

Did Maddie Ziegler perform at Coachella?

I did.

I recently performed at Coachella this year

with Labrinth and Sia,

and it was such a fun experience.

It's so crazy, for how many times I've performed,

I actually get nervous every time before I go on stage,

but I think it's more excitement nerves.

It's that adrenaline rush.

It's just that feeling

of, like, the anticipation of going on stage.

But the second I hit the stage, I'm so comfortable.

Does Maddie Ziegler have tattoos?

I do. I have a lot of little tattoos.

I think I have about seven.

They're all really small 'cause I wanted to make sure

that, for acting purposes, that it would be easier to cover

'cause it's not fun to have to sit

in that makeup chair a lot longer

to get a bunch of tattoos covered up.

But also I love the look of dainty ones,

and shout out to Docta Woo

because he's done all my tattoos, and I love him.

Because I'm indecisive,

I didn't wanna do anything

that I knew I would regret later in life.

and I know a lot of people

do end up regretting a lot of their tattoos,

so I make sure that all of my tattoos

are really, like, personal and sentimental.

So the first tattoo I got was, my grandma who passed away,

I got her name in cursive,

and it's also my sister's middle name.

So it's like a double meaning.

Maddie Ziegler 'Bloody Hell.'

So Bloody Hell is the original title name of a film

that I did that premiered at South by Southwest,

and now it is called Fitting In,

which will be premiering next year in theaters,

which is so exciting.

I adore the film and put so much on my heart into it,

and I can't wait for people to see it.

[board taps]

Thank you.

How did Maddie Ziegler became famous?

Become famous.

I guess on a reality show when I was seven years old.

It's so weird 'cause I hate saying that I'm famous.

I think it's just, like, a really weird concept for me.

So yeah, but I guess that's how I got my start.

How many turns can Maddie Ziegler do?

It depends because regularly,

I think I've been able to do probably like 10 turns,

but when you wear a tap shoe,

you can actually do more turns.

So maybe, I don't know, probably 18,

like, consecutive pirouettes.

I can turn for hours.

How many siblings does Maddie Ziegler have?

There's lots of those.

My sister and I are the only blood,

and then there's seven other ones.

How many crowns does Maddie Ziegler have?

[paper rips] Oh, I'm sorry.

I don't know.

I think I had around like 13, 12 or 13.

It's so funny because you work your whole life

when you're younger for these crowns,

and they're all just, like, these plastic tiaras

that actually don't mean anything,

so it's really funny how much I cared about it

when I was younger.

But yeah, they're not important now, but at the time.

How old was Maddie Ziegler-

[paper rips]

Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

In 'Chandelier.'

I'm ruining this whole board.

I was 11 years old when I did 'Chandelier.'

What's funny is when I was filming 'Chandelier,'

I remember I flew to L.A. and did it and had the best time.

But when I came back to my dance studio,

I told all my friends,

Just this little video that's gonna come out.

No one will see it.

I was like, I wore a blonde wig.

Like, it was really different and weird at the time,

and I never expected it to blow up the way that it did.

This is so much easier than I thought it would be.

[laughs] I thought- You're doing good.

Okay. [producer laughs]

Maddie Ziegler costumes.

I have lots of those.

My mom has kept

almost all of our dance competition costumes,

and she has 'em in a closet.

But I'm so happy.

I'm like, You can never get rid of them,

like, the important ones especially,

because I wanna be able

to look back on them when I'm older,

and I don't know, I want my kids to see them.

I don't know if I have a favorite.

There's so many to choose from.

A lot of my lyrical solos

that I did were really beautiful costumes

with a lot of rhinestones, and I liked them a lot.

Maddie Ziegler Imagination Palette.

Yeah, I was so excited to do a makeup collaboration.

Makeup is one of my absolute favorite things in the world,

so getting to create my own palette,

all of the shade names and the colors and the textures,

and just even the whole creative

for the shoot was so much fun.

And I had such a great experience.

When I was creating the shade names,

I think it was kind of a mixture of playing

into the concept of the Imagination Palette

and then also I think just a few personal names and things.

Like, I named a shade after my mom, after my sister,

so stuff like that.

Maddie Ziegler knee drop.

That was also a very, I guess, signature move

that I used to do,

which is so funny 'cause if I did that now,

my knees would probably break.

But basically, you start on one leg

and dive onto the other leg,

and you land on your knee.

But the trick is to obviously protect your knee

and to land more on the side of your hip.

Maddie Ziegler podcast.

I had a podcast with my sister called Take 20 for a bit,

and that was really fun.

We had a great time doing that.

And then I've had the pleasure

of being on a few other people's podcasts.

They're so fun.

It's such a good way to have a conversation

and dive into some topics

that maybe you wouldn't on the everyday basis.

Maddie Ziegler 'To All the Boys.'

Oh my gosh, this is hilarious.

I made a little cameo

in one of the To All the Boys movies.

I think it was the second film.

Yeah, I think I played a cheerleader.

I had, like, one line, but it was fun.

I love Lana Condor.

"A POLITICO analysis of recent polls — and data provided exclusively by Marquette Law School pollster Charles Franklin — shows Trump and Haley would assemble different electoral coalitions in matchups against Biden. And the differences aren’t just a curiosity: They’re undergirding Haley’s case as she seeks an unlikely, come-from-behind victory in the weeks leading up to the first caucuses and primaries.

“I beat Joe Biden by 10 to 13 points” in some of the polls, Haley told Fox News Channel this week, before pressing the electability argument down the ballot: “This is about governorships up and down the ticket. This is about House seats, Senate seats. This is about winning again.”

POLITICO examined four recent surveys from major pollsters that included multiple general-election matchups. The Fox News, CNN/SSRS and Marquette polls all showed Haley running stronger against Biden than Trump.

To understand why Haley outperforms Trump against Biden, we looked at what we’ll call Biden-Haley voters: People who would vote for Biden in a 2020 rematch with Trump, but switch to Haley when she’s the hypothetical GOP nominee instead. Roughly 43 percent of the electorate would vote for Biden in either matchup, according to Marquette’s polling, and 47 percent for Trump or Haley but not Biden.

But it’s that 7 percent nationally who would vote for Biden against Trump — but Haley against Biden — who represent a potentially key bloc of swing voters next year.

The Marquette data, which includes both a national survey and one in the key swing state of Wisconsin, show Haley is grabbing the middle of the electorate along partisan and ideological lines in a way that Trump is not. Nationally, 16 percent of voters who say they are independents but lean toward the Democratic Party fall into the category of these Biden-Haley voters. Similarly, 14 percent of self-described moderates in Wisconsin are Biden-Haley voters.

Another place where Haley draws some Biden voters away is among those with weaker impressions of the president’s job performance. In the national Marquette poll, 17 percent of voters who “somewhat disapprove” of Biden’s job performance fall into the Biden-Haley camp. In the Wisconsin poll, it’s 20 percent of those “somewhat disapprove” voters.

That’s a similar phenomenon to the 2022 midterms, when exit polls showed voters who somewhat disapproved of Biden split nearly evenly between Democratic and Republican congressional candidates — despite those negative views of Biden’s job performance.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, views of Trump — who has plenty of intraparty critics, despite his overall dominance of the GOP — are also a key predictor of Biden-Haley voters: Nationally, 14 percent of voters who held a “very unfavorable” opinion of Trump would vote for Biden over Trump, but Haley over Biden.

There’s also some evidence that Haley will draw in some disaffected voters. In Wisconsin, 19 percent of voters who said they were “not too enthusiastic” about the 2024 election were these Biden-Haley voters.

Haley’s support also appears to cut across some demographic lines into groups among whom Trump has especially struggled.

The Marquette polling — both nationally and in Wisconsin — showed men and women made up equal shares of Biden-Haley voters. But other polls suggest a Haley nomination, however unlikely, could narrow the gap between men and women in the 2024 vote.

In last month’s Fox News poll, Trump led Biden by 13 points among men, while Biden led Trump by 4 points among women. If Haley is the nominee instead, she wins men by 16 points while beating Biden by 5 points among women, a net difference of 9 points.

Similarly, the CNN/SSRS poll has Trump ahead by 14 points and Haley up by 12 points among men in matchups with Biden. But while Biden leads Trump by 7 points among women, Biden and Haley are tied in that matchup.

Haley’s potential to close the gender gap while maintaining the GOP’s dominance among men would dramatically alter the electoral math for both parties. According to estimates from the Democratic data firm Catalist, Biden ran 10 points better with women (57 percent) than with men (47 percent) in the 2020 election.

Haley could also bridge some of the class divide that has roiled politics in recent years by bringing some of the better-educated voters who’ve fled Trump back into the Republican fold. In the CNN/SSRS poll, Trump dominates Biden among white voters without college degrees, 63 percent to 31 percent. But Biden leads among white voters who graduated from college, 53 percent to 31 percent.

Matched up with Haley instead, the former South Carolina governor essentially matches Trump’s margins with non-college white voters, leading Biden, 61 percent to 30 percent. But she also eliminates Trump’s deficit with white voters with college degrees, leading slightly, 50 percent to 47 percent.

The Fox News poll was similar. Trump leads Biden by 20 points among non-college white voters but trails by 2 among white voters who graduated from college. Haley has a similar, 23-point lead with white voters who didn’t graduate from college, but she also leads Biden by 15 points among those who did.

The Marquette data similarly showed voters with bachelor’s or post-graduate degrees as more likely to fall into the Biden-Haley camp than their less-educated counterparts, though the differences were smaller than those the school found for ideology and Biden approval.

The final difference between Trump and Haley is Haley’s ability to win crossover voters — a small-but-significant slice of Americans who voted for Biden in the 2020 election but are willing to swing their votes for a Republican next year. Franklin told POLITICO that his data show Haley winning about 15 percent of Biden’s 2020 voters, compared with Trump winning only 5 percent of them.

That’s also apparent in the Fox News poll: Haley wins 14 percent of Biden 2020 voters, while 7 percent of Biden voters say they’d vote for Trump in a 2020 rematch.

Of course, Haley still has — to put it generously — an uphill path to the nomination. Her potential to alter the GOP’s electoral coalition won’t matter if she never makes it past the primary to prove it.",political
"The Raspberry Pi 5 is a powerful board, in terms of processing power and how much it can consume. But did you know that the Raspberry Pi 5 (and the 4 before it) consumes power when in standby mode?

When powered off and in standby the Raspberry Pi 5 can consume 1.29 Watts of power. It will sit there with the power LED lit and the SoC powered up ready. The reason for this is that some HATs have an issue with the 3v3 rail being powered off, but the 5V, passed through from the USB power supply being active.

What if we could lower our power consumption at standby by 185% with just one line of code? We can do that using a little Linux magic. Reducing the standby power is useful for mobile and battery powered projects. It will help prolong the life of the project and require less frequent battery charges.

Reducing Raspberry Pi 5 Power Consumption

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

This hack is easy, all we need to do is alter a configuration file, reboot and we can enjoy a lower standby power consumption.

1. Open a Terminal and run this command. This will open a nano text editor where we can make changes to the EEPROM.

sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit

2. Scroll down and change the following line.

POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0 Change to POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1

3. Press CTRL + X, Y and then ENTER to save and exit.

Reboot the Raspberry Pi to write the changes to the EEPROM. When powered off, your Raspberry Pi 5 will now consume much less power in standby.

Reducing Raspberry Pi 4 Power Consumption

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

On the Raspberry Pi 4 we need to take an additional step to tweak the standby power. That step is to turn off “wake on GPIO.” This line is found in the same config file.

1. Open a Terminal and run this command. This will open a nano text editor where we can make changes to the EEPROM.

sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit

2. Scroll down and change the following line. If this line is missing, add it.

POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0 Change to POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1

3. Change this line to turn off wake on GPIO.

"Anne Hidalgo has faced fierce criticism in recent weeks for taking a trip to French Polynesia just days after a terror attack in a school in Paris | Geoffrey van der Hasselt/AFP via Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

PARIS — Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo said attacks on her governing style after a controversial trip to Tahiti were sexist and an attempt to tarnish her reputation ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games.

The mayor, who accused the government of lagging on Olympic preparations, has faced fierce criticism in recent weeks for taking a trip to French Polynesia just days after a terror attack in a school and amid tensions in Paris after the Hamas attack in Israel.

Her trip’s official purpose was to visit the Tahiti venue that will host the 2024 Olympics’ surfing competition, as unveiled by newspaper Le Canard enchaîné on October 25. However, outlet Le Parisien later reported that Hidalgo went on to visit her daughter who lives on an island near Bora-Bora for a one-week private vacation.

In total, the trip by the mayor, who was accompanied by no less than five members of her cabinet, cost about €60,000, according to figures provided by her staff, amid a sharp increase in the town’s debt and a spike in Paris’ local taxes. The eye-popping figure led opponents in the local council to lodge an appeal with the National Financial Prosecutor’s Office into possible misuse of public funds, questioning its “legality.” In a particularly stormy session of the Paris Council, a borough mayor brandished a “Tahiti” branded shower gel.

Hidalgo said she paid for the private segment of her trip and the return ticket herself.

“What happened was extremely violent,” she said in an interview with POLITICO Tuesday while making direct eye contact with the reporter in the splendid dining room of the neo-Renaissance Town Hall which she has occupied for nearly a decade. “But what I care about is my direct relationship with Parisians.”

One of the most divisive figures on the French political scene, opponents and rivals attack Hidalgo for her unapologetic style and solitary exercise of power. But Hidalgo denied a Le Monde report that she brushed off warnings from her top male advisers about the trip, framing it as sexist.

“Ah yes, women always need men,” she said with a smirk. “Women are always ‘alone’ and ‘authoritarian’… ‘hysterical’.”

Hidalgo lashed out at all of those who attacked her, suggesting the upcoming of the Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 and presumably the international fame that goes with it made her opponents jealous: “What really pisses them off is the Games,” she said.

Still, it’s hard to deny a serious miscalculation, aggravated by a muddled initial response. By taking three weeks of absence in a heated international context and in the midst of a wave of anti-Semitic acts that hit Paris, Hidalgo could not offer a better opening to her opponents, particularly to Parisian conservatives and some of French President Emmanuel Macron’s top lieutenants who dream of overthrowing her.

What is more, there was a “hic,” as they say in French: if the main official purpose of her trip was to visit the Tahitian site of the surfing events for the 2024 Olympic Games, it eventually appeared that she had not been able to visit the site “because of the tense atmosphere” after local protests, according to her team, and had to be replaced by her deputy sports director.

Fighting fire with fire

But rather than seeking sympathy, the mayor is attempting to show her fighting spirit. For it is no secret in Paris that she has a big reputational stake in hosting the Olympic Games next June.

To get out of the media storm, Hidalgo has since indulged in a series of announcements: a local referendum in Paris on SUVs, a 50 km/h speed limit on the Paris ring road from September 2024, right up to her cleverly publicized departure from X.

But it was her declaration on a prime-time television program that transport would not “be ready” for the Olympics that caused the most headlines, drawing the wrath of the center-right regional government (which has authority over transport), and of several ministers, at the risk of tarnishing the image of the event on which she is so keen to capitalize.

Without batting an eyelid, one week later, Hidalgo maintained her claims. “We won’t be ready regarding public transportation,” she says, pointing to lack of government involvement and recalling that Paris has one of the “densest” transport networks in the world.

“But don’t worry,” she explains, in all seriousness. “If the metros are packed,” commuters will discover the joys of “cycling and walking” in Paris and its surrounding region, she added — two transport modes that she has actively developed in the French capital over the last few years, and even that not without some fury.",political
"A Trump reelection bid could influence the timing of Canada’s next election or deal a wild card to the race, with the odds currently stacked heavily against Trudeau.

“A second Trump presidency almost certainly creates a situation where the next election won’t be about Pierre Poilievre or Justin Trudeau — it will be about Donald Trump and Canada’s relationship with an America that is led by an angry, vengeful creature,” said Scott Reid, who worked in former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin’s office.

“I don’t know if that might benefit Poilievre or if it may benefit Justin Trudeau, but I think it is the kind of event that has the force to reset the next election in Canada.”

Poilievre, a career politician, has fashioned himself as an outsider to the country’s political elite. When he won the party leadership in 2022, the Liberals did not bother to try to define him or launch a major ad campaign to slow his momentum — strange to many Canadian political insiders.

These days, Trudeau’s Liberals keep repeating that Poilievre is “not worth the risk.” They say he’s “reckless” and “unhinged” with moves “straight out of the Republican playbook” in efforts to link him to the Trump arm of the party.

They recently mashed up Trump and Poilievre clips in a compare-contrast video, showing both politicians attacking the press as fake news and going after woke censorship and political correctness.

Reid says they are a year late to the punch. “If it’s a deliberate, conscious strategy — if they could pay for that paid media and they’ve decided not to — well, then that’s mind boggling and in my view an egregious strategic error.”

Trudeau can trigger an election any time before the fall of 2025, so the U.S.-Canada election calendars could sync in a way that would plaster Trump across Canadian media in 2024.

Canadians got a sampling of what that might be like during the past week.

One moment that left no doubt about the strategy occurred when Trudeau attributed a Conservative vote against the Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement to the “the rise of a right-wing American, MAGA-influence thinking that has made Canadian Conservatives, who used to be among the strongest defenders of Ukraine … turn their backs on something Ukraine needs in its hour of need.”

The Conservatives said they were opposed to a carbon tax clause in the document, but Trudeau accused the lawmakers of “starting to parrot Russian disinformation and misinformation and propaganda.”

The rhetoric dialed up.

Liberal lawmaker Adam van Koeverden said in Parliament this week that “Canada’s support for Ukraine should have been unanimous in this House, but, just like Donald Trump, the leader of the Conservatives is cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.”

Another Liberal lawmaker, Ken Hardie, was forced to apologize for controversially linking Poilievre and hard-right rhetoric to a shooting in Winnipeg that left four dead — aiming to draw a link between the unintended consequences from escalated rhetoric.

Conservatives have a word for this: desperation. And they think the gambit will backfire when voters look at Trudeau’s record.

Kory Teneycke, former communications director in former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s office, said the Liberals making Trump a proxy is a bad play.

“They’re flailing around for arguments and ways to try to pull their numbers up and pull Poilievre’s down,” he said, and it doesn’t ring true.

“The Conservative Party is leading with female voters, with new Canadian voters. It’s a party that embraces those new Canadians as opposed to having undertones of nativism and xenophobia. That’s why it doesn’t work.”

On top of that, at least one poll found Poilievre is Canadians’ preferred leader to deal with a Trump presidency.

“You want to find things that people agree with you on, and then turn the lens on those,” he said. “This is not a winning strategy.”

Teneycke suggested Poilievre is probably closer to a Paul Ryan figure, as a more conventional conservative campaigning on lower taxes and personal freedom with more of a “libertarian complexion to many of his arguments.”

Poilievre may not be that same “pure heroin” source of entertainment, bombast and astonishment, but there is some “hard right, populist appeal,” Reid said. “There are at least elements of the MAGA movement present in his message and methods.”

They are playing the same cards, he adds. “It is anti-institution. It is challenging the establishment, both in real terms and in mythically exaggerated, self-serving bullshit terms. And it’s fundamentally autocratic strongman politics.”

Alex Marland, a political science professor at Acadia University who researches political branding in Canada, says this marks a major turning point for Trudeau, who has spent much of his political career trying to emit “Obama-esque” positive energy and messaging to voters.

“Trudeau has absolutely avoided going negative,” he said, instead getting “other people to be the ones to say negative things.”

No longer.

“Something is changing,” he said. “It tells you that through research, they’ve determined that this is the best line attack, their best communications approach against an opponent who is beating them, frankly, in the polls.”

In past elections, he said, what the Liberals have done with their opponents is focus on domestic policy: social issues, gun control, abortion.

Past polling shows Canadians have a distaste for Trump, after his presidency upended Canada’s historically strong relationship with the U.S. — when Trump tore up NAFTA — and Trudeau could position himself as standing up for the country’s interests.

Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner wrote this week that the emerging “boogeyman narrative” is the early stages of a “Hail-Mary election play,” and it appears the Liberals need Trump. “A MAGA-messaging-reliant Liberal campaign narrative with Justin Trudeau still at the helm has only one optimal window for an election: the October before a Biden vs Trump presidential election day.”

But Supriya Dwivedi, senior counsel at Enterprise Canada, dismisses the idea.

“If interest rates start to come down, if particularly grocery prices start to come down and folks aren’t seeing like C$4 for a head of mini lettuce anymore, then a lot of the anger you’re seeing and the disaffection will start to subside,” she said.

She said in trying to define Poilievre, Trudeau should simply point to what he is saying and doing: The “constant demonization” of the free press, calling the prime minister a Marxist and making references to radical gender ideology.

The compare/contrast with MAGA messaging would also actually have to stick to work — and a lot of that would hinge on what their opponents say in the future.

“If there’s a drumbeat of certain messaging and catchphrases coming out of Donald Trump supporters that are finding their way into Canadian politics and are being emanated by conservatives, then there’s no question the Liberals are going to draw upon that and try and create this connection,” Marland said.

“But if there’s totally different language going on, it becomes very hard.”",political
"When a historian wrote an essay the other day warning that the election of former President Donald J. Trump next year could lead to dictatorship, one of Mr. Trump’s allies quickly responded by calling for the historian to be sent to prison.

It almost sounds like a parody: The response to concerns about dictatorship is to prosecute the author. But Mr. Trump and his allies are not going out of their way to reassure those worried about what a new term would bring by firmly rejecting the dictatorship charge. If anything, they seem to be leaning into it.

If Mr. Trump is returned to office, people close to him have vowed to “come after” the news media, open criminal investigations into onetime aides who broke with the former president and purge the government of civil servants deemed disloyal. When critics said Mr. Trump’s language about ridding Washington of “vermin” echoed that of Adolf Hitler, the former president’s spokesman said the critics’ “sad, miserable existence will be crushed” under a new Trump administration.

Mr. Trump himself did little to assuage Americans when his friend Sean Hannity tried to help him out on Fox News this past week. During a town hall-style meeting, Mr. Hannity tossed a seeming softball by asking Mr. Trump to reaffirm that of course he did not intend to abuse his power and use the government to punish enemies. Instead of simply agreeing, Mr. Trump said he would only be a dictator on “Day 1” of a new term.",political
"While an ebook subscription might sound ideal, you should take some time to consider the pros and cons of each one. These digital reading services are often billed as the equivalent of Netflix or Spotify for books, and there are similarities, but ebook subscriptions also have some unexpected restrictions.

Content: All ebook subscription services offer limited libraries of ebooks. (This is where the Netflix comparison is useful.) They may boast more than a million titles, but that total doesn’t necessarily include any works by your favorite authors; none of the services we tested had a single title by Cormac McCarthy, for example, though some had audiobooks of his works.

The big five publishers (Penguin Random House, Hachette, Macmillan, HarperCollins, and Simon & Schuster) dominate the bestseller charts in the US but have had limited dealings with ebook subscription services so far. Current best-seller lists are not well represented, and the modest list of mainstream hits that appears mostly comprises older titles. Whatever service you are considering, we advise browsing the available library of ebooks and audiobooks before you commit.

Reading Habits: If you only read one or two books a month, you might be better off buying popular titles, recommendations from trusted friends, or works by your favorite authors. That way, you get to choose the best ebooks and keep them. With ebook subscriptions, you lose access the moment you stop subscribing, and the library of available books can change at any time without notice.

Voracious readers who are happy to try new and unfamiliar authors will likely get the most value from ebook subscriptions. But while these services are typically described as unlimited, they often do have hidden limits. This is where they differ from services like Spotify and Netflix. With Scribd, for example, the available library is reduced when you hit opaque limits.

Support: Make sure the devices you like to read on are supported. Most ebook subscription services offer apps for Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac, at a minimum. Languages, accessibility, and extra features like search vary, so do your research to make sure the app supports your needs. Sadly, many ebook readers, like Kindles, are not compatible with ebook subscription services other than their manufacturer’s offering.

Audiobooks: Unlike ebook subscription services, some audiobook services offer a monthly credit system that allows you to buy audiobooks you can keep, even if you stop subscribing. Others offer apparently unlimited access to a streaming library, but there are often hidden limits that narrow your choice for that month after you’ve listened to an audiobook or two. Consider also the maximum bitrate for audio streams, as this differs from service to service and can impact the quality of your audiobook.",technology
"Smith is seeking permission from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to introduce evidence that isn’t specifically charged in the criminal indictment but may be relevant to the jury’s consideration of the alleged crimes. These details, known as 404(b) evidence, are commonly introduced in criminal matters to aid the jury’s ability to consider a defendant’s intent or motive based on uncharged “bad acts.” In this case, Smith says the evidence will help jurors assess Trump’s intent during the frenzied weeks before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, as he sought to subvert the election.

The false election fraud claims from prior years aren’t the only streams of 404(b) evidence that prosecutors want to introduce. Gaston indicated that they intend to tell jurors about Trump’s repeated refusals in 2016 and 2020 to commit to a peaceful transfer of power. They want to introduce his September 2020 exhortation to the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” which became a call to action for the group’s leaders at the time and put the group on a path to becoming an integral part of the Jan. 6 breach of the Capitol.

Prosecutors also say Trump engaged in a campaign of retaliation against Republican Party allies who refused to countenance his claims of election fraud — including the former legal counsel of the RNC.

Prosecutors also reiterated that they anticipate telling jurors about Trump’s efforts to align himself with Jan. 6 rioters in the years following the violence. Trump has described them as “hostages,” vowed to consider pardoning many of them, complained of the sentences doled out even to the most serious offenders and even recorded a song with some of the most violent riot defendants housed at the D.C. jail.

“This evidence shows that the rioters’ disruption of the certification proceeding is exactly what the defendant intended on January 6,” Gaston wrote.

Trump spent the days and weeks leading up to the 2012 election — when President Barack Obama would best GOP nominee Mitt Romney to win reelection — complaining without basis that voting machines were being manipulated or that the election was being tainted by fraud. In 2016, before winning the White House, Trump began to argue that Republicans were “naïve” not to think rampant cheating was occurring.",political

From “New York Times Opinion,” this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” Well before 10/7, the dominant narrative in Israel was that there’s no hope of a two-state solution, not any time soon, because there isn’t a partner for peace. I think there are ways in which that’s been true. I think there are times in which that has been true. And I think it’s also a bit of a dodge. It absolves Israel of responsibility for what it has done to make sure there’s not a partner for peace, and it has taken too much pressure off of Israeli policy towards Palestine in the present. It allowed a lot of people to become comfortable with a kind of stasis. And the ones who weren’t comfortable, the ones who still had the power and the energy to act, were settlers in the West Bank, was the radical right in Israel, who have done everything in their power explicitly — they have said this explicitly — to try to make any kind of two-state reality impossible. And so Israel has been moving towards what people call a one-state reality, not the one state that the left sometimes imagines, where you have equal rights across all of Israel and Palestine, and it becomes one multi-ethnic nation, but the one state reality of apartheid, the one-state reality in which Israel does have functional control over Gaza, over the West Bank, but the people in it do not have anything like real rights. I would say, and I think this is a very common view, that was a reality before 10/7. And in that reality, for years now, a group of hundreds of former senior defense and diplomatic officials in Israel have been saying this is a catastrophe, that it is a catastrophe for Israeli security, a catastrophe for Israeli democracy, a catastrophe for Israelis’ international standing, and a catastrophe for Israel’s soul. Their warnings seem quite prescient now. And they’ve argued there was another way. There was a huge amount Israel could do on its own and should have been doing, that if Israel is not going to tip into a kind of single state that it did not want and could not ultimately defend, that the conditions had to be created now for something else to emerge in the future. One of the people working on that project was Nimrod Novik. He’s my guest today. Novik was a top aide to Shimon Peres when Peres was prime minister and vice premier. In that role, Novik was involved in all manner of negotiations with the Palestinians, with the Arab world, with the international community. He’s on the executive committee of Commanders for Israel’s Security, which is a group I mentioned a minute ago. And he’s an Israel fellow at the Israel Policy Forum. I want to talk to him about those plans and how they look now in light of the attacks on 10/7 and the war in Gaza, the unimaginable horror of being in Gaza, the amount of grief and fury and vengeance that is building there, that has built there, and the question that is inescapable. This war eventually will end. It has to end, hopefully soon. Who is going to govern Gaza? How can they govern Gaza after this? We’ve been hearing very different things on that from Netanyahu, from the US, from the Arab world. But of course, there’s a question of who will the Gazans allow to govern them? And if Israel is simply going to be occupying Gaza indefinitely, that is going to be a security risk and a horror of its own. So I want to talk about that day after question, which, of course, is being decided in different ways, right now, in this day, with the bombs dropping, and a number I found just shocking, about 80 percent of Gazans now displaced. I want to talk with Nimrod about what might be politically possible in Israel, given the unpopularity of the current government and the possibility that it could collapse in the coming months, or certainly, in the coming years. Before we go to the show, I should mention we’re still taking questions for the Ask Me Anything. So you can email us at ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Nimrod Novik, welcome to the show.

nimrod novik

Thanks for having me.

ezra klein

So I want to begin with the document you helped write in November of 2021. It’s called Initiative 2025, and it had these two premises that I think are important. One was that there was no prospect for a two-state solution then, or for that matter, now. And two is that even so, there was still a lot that Israel could and should do. So tell me about what that proposal was and what that coalition that you were part of recommended.

nimrod novik

The group that worked on it, called Commanders for Israel’s Security, it’s over 500 Israeli retired generals, as well as their equivalents from the Mossad, Shin Bet Security, National Security Council, the entire Israeli security establishment. And we formed a team. We felt that Israeli policy was far too reactive and far too conservative for the good of the country, national security, short and long-term. We had not anticipated the trauma of October 7, but we certainly anticipated things getting from bad to worse, unless Israel changes course. So we came up with a plan that suggested even though a two-state solution, as you said, is not on this side of the horizon, but given that eventually, it’s the only solution that we believe serves Israel’s security and well-being long-term, as a strong Jewish democracy, we mapped out what can and should be done in the coming two, three years to reverse the slide towards the disaster of a one-state solution.

ezra klein

Tell me a bit about that. How would you describe what Israeli policy towards Palestinians, towards the West Bank and Gaza, was in 2021, when you wrote that. What was the governing theory? And why do you believe it was going to slide into what you call a one-state solution?

nimrod novik

There were primarily two governing concepts, if you will, of the Israeli policy. Again, calling it policy is giving it more credit than deserved. Israeli governments have been reluctant to determine the end game of our relationship with the Palestinians. Where do we want to see ourselves and them two years, five years, 50 years from now? No decision has been made since the Oslo era. As a result, what we’ve seen was a policy based on insisting on separating the Gaza Strip, ruled by Hamas from the West Bank, ruled sort of by the Palestinian Authority. Separation was one principle. And the other one was dubbed status quo, even though it was an illusion, because nothing was static about it. As a matter of fact, creeping annexation has been accelerating under various governments. And the prospects of separating Israelis and Palestinians into a two-state reality was becoming less and less possible. The more territory was taken by settlements, the more extreme settlers were conducting violent raids into Palestinian civil populations. The more the Palestinian Authority internally defective, becoming more and more authoritarian, more and more detached from its own constituents, less responsive, less capable of governance, losing control over large swaths of West Bank territory, forcing the IDF to enter more and more. And it became daily and nightly raids into areas that were supposed to be controlled, and law and order was supposed to be maintained by the Palestinian Authority. It was a slide into a state where the Palestinian Authority would cease to function as the promise of the nucleus of a Palestinian state. If we look at it today, it’s already perhaps the municipal government of the city of Ramallah, rather than of the West Bank, and weakening the Palestinian Authority by choking it financially. By not allowing it to demonstrate to its people that it is the vehicle that will bring them one day to their aspiration of statehood, on the one hand, and making sure that Hamas controls Gaza, the two tracks spelled disaster. So I must confess, we had not anticipated that the disaster will look the way it did on October 7, but we certainly realized that the policy in Gaza of rounds of violence every year, every two years, every 18 months, and buying off relative tranquility by funding Hamas through the auspices of Qatar, allowing it to arm and rearm, the inherent contradictions in the policy were quite apparent. And we thought that it’s time for Israel to change course by taking the initiative and reversing the policy, both in Gaza and the West Bank.

ezra klein

So one thing I have noticed is that there are different versions of the one-state fear, hope, and expectation floating around. There’s a left-wing one-state solution you’ll hear about sometimes, right? A state where everybody within the territory of what is thought to be Israel and Palestine will have equal rights. Everybody will vote. I’d call that a little more utopic theory, but it is something you hear on the left. There’s a right-wing one-state solution. I think when you mentioned the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, I think if you read things he has written in the past, he is looking for a one-state solution. He wants to crush Palestinian dreams of statehood and repress Palestinians sufficiently that they stop believing they can ever have anything better and eventually content themselves to Israeli rule and live quietly within that in order to gain better lives. And then there’s a kind of, I might call it a realist one-state idea, that there is no more chance, there is no more realism to two states. It would not be possible to create functioning two states here. And so whether it is a state of equality or a state of inequality, that a one-state solution is all that exists because Israel just simply has too much control and does not have the political capacity anymore to roll that control back. And so this argument would be, this is already done. There is no plausible political horizon for a two-state solution, and the only question is what kind of one state you’re going to get. How do you think about that?

nimrod novik

I’ll put it bluntly. I believe that a two-state solution is inevitable, not because we wish it and not because it’s nice, not because Palestinians deserve self-determination — which they do, but that’s not a historic imperative. I believe that the two-state solution is inevitable because these two people are not going to live happily ever after under one roof. For that to happen, for the two people to stay in one state, one of two things have to happen. Either Israelis will agree to grant Palestinian equal rights in that one state and therefore become a minority, or at least, a slim majority in our own country, and that’s never going to happen. Israelis are not going to agree to be less than the overwhelming majority in our own country. Or Palestinians will agree forever to forgo equal rights, which I suspect is as unreasonable expectation as the other. So we will separate. The question is, are we going to separate because leaders led us there or because we bleed ourselves so much and for so long until both peoples come to their senses and go for the inevitable deal?

ezra klein

Let me key in on a word you just used, which is “separation.” When I read some of these documents, separation is an important word. I think people here think about peace deals and settlements, but separation is actually, it seems to me, more how this is spoken about politically in Israel. You go back to Rabin’s campaigns, where his slogan was, “Take Gaza out of Tel Aviv.” That’s a slogan of separation, not an argument for peace. Tell me about the language and the ideal of separation and how that might be different than some of the other ways this gets spoken about.

nimrod novik

Civil separation with overall security control — continued security control until a two-state agreement ushers in alternative security arrangements, is a concept that basically suggests reversing the creeping annexation, which is no longer creeping. It’s now galloping. So the idea is to start reversing the slide towards one-state reality in the opposite direction, of reducing the friction between the two populations, increasing the capacity of the PA to perform, while maintaining the overall security controlled by Israel until a deal is struck.

ezra klein

So let me get into what you actually recommended there because I think something you got at the end was important. You often hear when you talk to people in Israel about different paths that could be taken. Well, we don’t have anybody to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority doesn’t have credibility. Hamas wants our destruction. And a core premise of the report is that there are things Israel can do unilaterally, that it doesn’t need a partner to do things that will make the situation better from its perspective and create conditions maybe for deals in the future. So tell me what is in Israel’s power here. What would you actually recommend to do tangibly?

nimrod novik

It’s not a genetic deformation of the Palestinians that they cannot govern themselves. This is nonsense. We had a period after the Second Intifada, the years 2007, 2008, where the Palestinian Authority, there was a prime minister by the name of Salam Fayyad. First, he was finance minister, later on prime minister, who revitalized the Palestinian Authority in a dramatic way. The authority was on the rise. People were proud in it, its own population. They could have won elections at that point. And then Netanyahu was elected in 2009. Now, obviously, we are the strongest party. We hold most of the cards by far. And when we decide that we are going to choke the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian Authority will choke. If we decide to give it space and to give it the possibility of demonstrating to its own constituency that it can deliver, that it can govern. Now the second trend that happened was that Mahmoud Abbas, President Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, the early Abu Mazen was a very different person than the late one with whom we are dealing today. He became increasingly non-democratic, authoritarian, autocratic, paranoid, removing from his vicinity and from position of power all the best and brightest that were working during that era. Fearing competition, he exiled them either out of politics or out of the West Bank altogether. Things went from bad to worse, Israel doing its share in weakening the PA and the PA leadership became more claustrophobic. All these can change. On the Israeli side, what we felt was essential was allowing the Palestinian security agencies to perform their duty without embarrassing them in front of their own constituencies. They used to be the pride and joy of the Palestinian street. When they walked into the street in their uniform, they symbolized state in being. And with time, our conduct presented them as subcontractors of the Israeli occupation. When there is no political horizon, they are no longer serving Palestinian national interests, they are serving the Israeli occupation. And with that, morale goes down, and performance goes down. So one thing was, to strengthen the Palestinian security agencies by virtue of the way we treat them and our conduct. We suggested to expand the territory that the Palestinian Authority controls. We believed that nothing demonstrates sincerity of a commitment to a future two-state reality than reversing the annexation by taking small chunks of the West Bank that are now under Israeli control, redesignating them, and turning them to Palestinian Authority control, specifically — and we mapped it out — areas that allow for contiguity among Palestinian areas. At the moment, the West Bank is a Swiss cheese. It’s 169 islands of Palestinian-controlled areas surrounded each by Israeli-controlled territory. So we wanted to reduce that by half so that contiguity will have a security, law and order, and economic wellbeing effect. We suggested a host of economic measures that enable the Palestinian Authority to deliver for the people, which is the opposite of what’s happening now, when our minister of finance is choking the Palestinian Authority by withholding funds that are theirs by the agreement Israel collects taxes for the Palestinian Authority, VAT and others. And we are supposed to automatically transfer them to the Palestinian Authority. It’s the main chunk of their budget. So we recommended a host of economic measures of that nature, security measures, but the umbrella for it all was supposed to be a political horizon. We believed that Palestinian Authority cannot have legitimacy in the eyes of its own population and therefore will not be able to function properly if it is not perceived to be the vehicle that is leading the Palestinian people towards statehood, however long it might take and however arduous the road there. And therefore, we recommended that the government of Israel will find a way. And we have some suggestions to indicate an Israeli commitment to an eventual two-state solution. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

We’re talking in terms here that feel similar to how we could have been talking a few months ago, a few years ago. But right now, you have a full ground invasion of Gaza. You have 80 some percent of Gazans displaced, according to the UN. You have polling among Palestinians showing a rise in support for Hamas. And you have Israel with, it seems to me, no real theory of its way back out. Netanyahu says the army will have to be in Gaza until it finishes the job. That apparently means destroying Hamas. I hear a lot of disagreement from counterterrorism and military experts as to whether or not that’s actually possible. But even once that is done, the Palestinian Authority cannot just be installed by Israel. That would not be credible to Gazans. Netanyahu has come out and said that he believes the creation of the Palestinian Authority was a mistake, that nothing in Gaza can be given back to them, that there is not a sufficient difference between them and Hamas. So what do you understand is happening now? I mean, I was reading back in preparing for this, and I read this 2019 piece by Commanders for Israel’s Security, again, the group you’re part of, that was talking about Gaza. And it warned then that, quote, “A military-only approach may lead to the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and to Israel’s retaking control over its two million residents with no exit strategy in sight.” Is that not where Israel is now?

nimrod novik

Absolutely. That’s exactly where we are right now. Let’s assume that IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, are able to accomplish the mission of undoing Hamas’ governance and ability to threaten Israel by demolishing its military capabilities. We’re not there yet. And I’m not sure we’ll get there for reasons that are not up to us. OK? We may not have the time before the international community say stop in order to accomplish this objective, but let’s assume that we did. The morning after strategy in Washington, as well as elsewhere, including among commanders, commanders for Israel’s security in Israel, we all reached the same conclusion. The only solution that will allow Israel to exit the Gaza Strip is the Palestinian Authority. Now nobody is naive, and nobody assumes, as you said correctly, that the Palestinian Authority, in its current miserable state, can hardly control the West Bank, let alone Gaza. And it will take years before the PA can be rehabilitated, revitalized, and its symbolic role becomes substantive, and it really runs the Gaza Strip. And besides it cannot walk into Gaza on the shoulders of the Israeli tank. It will lose all credibility if it does. And therefore, there’s the need for an interim something, some third party interim arrangement under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority. And two, it’s all within the context of a political horizon. What they need initially, knowing that the PA is incapable of doing the job, they need the PA to grant legitimacy to whatever third party walks into Gaza when the IDF is phased out. It has to be invited by the PA. It has to be coordinated with the PA. Funding for rehabilitation should go through the PA. And here, the prime minister, as you correctly quoted, says, no, no PA. Now no PA, there’s nobody. There’s nobody. And therefore, if, indeed, he and this government last for more than a few months, then the prospects of a prolonged Israeli occupation of Gaza and need to manage not just security, but civil affairs, to run the lives of 2.3 million Palestinians, from street cleaning to schools and hospitals and what have you, seem frighteningly realistic.

ezra klein

You say frightening, but why would Israel not just do that? Why would it not just decide, well, it’s occupied and run Gaza before. It does not trust that leaving it to the PA, to say nothing of Hamas, will keep it safe. There are more right-wing figures in Israel who want Israel to run Gaza because they feel that is part of Israel, attaining full control over what they think of as greater Israel. So why not just keep it? Why would that not be what the Israeli government decides to do or wants to do? Or if it does try to do that, why would you oppose that decision?

nimrod novik

We’ve been there. We’ve been there both in Gaza, but another example is an Israeli government that instructed the IDF to go into Lebanon for 48 hours, and it took a very courageous prime minister named Ehud Barak to get us out 18 years later. Prime Minister Sharon, who took us out of Gaza in 2005, didn’t do it as a gesture to the Palestinian Authority or Hamas. He did it because the price of staying there was far too high for the Israeli public to be willing to continue paying. He did it the wrong way. He did it unilaterally. He allowed Hamas to take credit for it. And that helped Hamas win the elections thereafter. Never mind that. In the younger Palestinian generation on the West Bank, the popularity of Hamas is sky high. Why is that so? Why wasn’t it the case 10 years ago? Why is that so? Because Hamas seems the only one who can do something about the Israeli occupation. They supported the Palestinian Authority as long as the Oslo process seemed vibrant, seemed to offer an end to the occupation. But one generation after another of Palestinians witnessed an endless situation that they want to put an end to. So if negotiations or moderation, like the Palestinian Authority, is not rewarded, then we’ll go for an armed struggle, sure. If I were under occupation, I would go for an armed struggle. So it’s not that I justify Hamas, God forbid, but I blame us for teaching Palestinians the wrong lesson. For a decade, Netanyahu policy was to reward Hamas after every round of violence — more concessions, more easing of the closure after every round of violence. And at the same time, the Palestinian Authority that is being praised by the Israeli security establishment for fighting Hamas on the West Bank is being choked in so many ways, rather than enabled to flourish. So yes, we taught Palestinians a lesson that the only language we understand is the language of Hamas.

ezra klein

I can’t myself imagine the fury of Gazans right now, right? I can imagine, in many ways, the fury of Israelis. I know more Israelis. I’m Jewish myself. But when I look at the death toll, when I look at the displacement, when I look at the destruction, when I look at how many people have lost how much — homes and family members and jobs and livelihoods — and I think of what comes after this, I mean, it’s not like the population of Gaza was well disposed to Israelis before, but it does seem to me that it is hard to imagine the desire for vengeance, for a recapturing just of dignity that will follow this. And one thing I really don’t hear is any theory of what is to be done with that, how that will, in any way, be calmed or given space or recognition. I mean, this has always been bad, but I think that there is a recognition internationally, but also domestically, in Israel and in America, of the power of Israeli grief after 10/7. And I don’t see any recognition of the power of Palestinian grief. But there is certainly a tsunami of it building. How do you think about that?

nimrod novik

First, I completely agree with you. I think that the consequences are devastating. I think the human misery in Gaza, I can’t even begin to imagine how people feel. I felt — mistakes have consequences. Let me put it this way. I have a lot of complaints to all third parties, but as an Israeli, I channel my primary complaints to my own government. With all due respect to the others, mine is supposed to serve my, as a Israeli patriot, best interests — the security, the well-being, and the future of the country. We hold most of the cards vis a vis Gaza and vis a vis the West Bank. And when we play our cards wrong, the consequences are the ones that you described. A wrong policy of 15 years may take 15 years to rectify. I don’t know. I have no idea. We are in uncharted territory. This is all unprecedented. Everything that has happened over the last year, the 10 months of the attempt by Netanyahu for a judicial coup against democracy in the country, the response to it — unprecedented. Demonstrations, the enormous trauma of 10/7. When it turns out that the government didn’t exist the morning after October 7 and the needs of the population were met by the same groups that protested the government a few days earlier, all of it is unprecedented, as is the devastation of Gaza. So when you deal with something that is unprecedented, and you don’t have something to fall back on and say, well, this is how it’s going to happen, how it’s going to transform, I have no idea. The only thing that I can do is try to advocate a different course that I believe that eventually will lead to a different reality. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

There is a way in which it I think is simply true that a huge number of people, Gazan specifically, but not only — Israelis, too — have paid an unimaginable price for, among other things, a tremendous intelligence failure. I’d been following the reporting on this. And early on, it said that things like, well, people could see Hamas training exercises, and they had heard some chatter. But more recently, the reporting has been that the Israeli intelligence services had gotten their hands on functionally the plan here. Somebody somehow had gotten Hamas’s description for planning something very much like this, and this had been sent up the chain and was dismissed as aspirational, that they would never attempt something like this. And then when they saw training exercises, it looked like the plan they already had. They reported that and said, this sure seems like they’re training to do the thing that we got this information that they want to do. And that was also dismissed. And it actually seems kind of staggering to me that the government that was not able to hone its own intelligence correctly to hear what its intelligence was saying to it is still the one prosecuting this war and is still trusted to know what the right response is because it feels like there’s this alternative reality we could be living in, where the right analysts were listened to, and the relevant IDF forces weren’t pulled out of Gaza to protect West Bank settlers. And 10/7 doesn’t happen, or it happens at a very, very, very limited scale. And we’re living in a very different reality today. I’m curious how the politics of Israel are absorbing these kinds of reports. Because when I read this piece in “The Times” and seen it reported elsewhere, I was genuinely shocked.

nimrod novik

Yeah, certainly. All the heads of the security establishment relevant to intelligence, the chief of staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the head of the IDF military intelligence, all of them took responsibility. The one who repeatedly refuses to take responsibility is the prime minister. So that’s one thing that happened. His politicking the war, preparing for the investigation commission the day after, preparing his alibi and doing almost exclusively politics. The reaction of the public is interesting. You have something close to 80 percent of the public that want him to go. There is an overwhelming consensus in the country that he has to go. I ascribe it not to politics and not to hate, but to a healthy Jewish survival instinct. If you cannot trust the prime minister to conduct the war with exclusively national security interests in mind, if anybody in the public, and so many do suspect him of a conflict of interest of injecting his legal predicament, he should go, even if all those who are suspecting him are wrong. But the very fact that he gave them the possibility of even suspecting the prime minister to conduct a war with a conflict of interest, he must go.

ezra klein

I want to pull out something you’re saying there. Because if you’re Netanyahu, when this war ends, you have a series of quiet, I think, terrifying things waiting for you. First is that you either resign or very likely are defeated in disgrace. You go down as the prime minister who allowed this to happen. You have, as you mentioned, legal troubles, corruption investigations, that could leave you in jail. And you have the end of your legacy. I mean, Netanyahu, of course, understands himself in a certain way and does not want his final act to be falling on the sword for this, does not want this to be the way he goes down in history. And so, I think if you’re him, he has a real incentive to keep this going, to keep ratcheting up the threat, to keep holding himself up as a war-time leader in the hopes that something about his conduct in the war will change the public’s perception of him. And Israel, the elections are not the way they work in the US, are not cleanly scheduled in the same fashion. And so the fact that he has the incentive to potentially extend the war, he also has something of the power to do it. So what checks are there on him?

nimrod novik

I share the suspicions and the analysis that you so eloquently put out. I was hoping — and I still am — that the combination of the two former chiefs of staff, Benny Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot, having joined the war cabinet and the fact that they and the defense establishment will prevent irrelevant considerations from affecting decisions, that was my hope. It still is. I am beginning to doubt that he is not more sophisticated than all of them. We may end up paying a price for not insisting as a public on him gone when fateful decisions are made every day, literally every day. So I’m counting on Gantz and Eizenkot and the professionals at the top of the IDF and Mossad and the Shin Bet to see to it that there’s no mischief in national security decision-making.

ezra klein

Because the system is very different there, for those unfamiliar with it, how does an election happen in Israel? What has to happen for the Israeli public to have the opportunity to replace Netanyahu?

nimrod novik

Either the Knesset runs its course, four years, and then its predetermined date, which rarely happens in Israel, in Israeli politics. I don’t remember the last government that lasted that long. Or the Knesset votes itself out, and elections are called for. Or the prime minister resigns, and with him, the Knesset is dismissed. But you don’t need elections to have an alternative coalition. In our system, it is called constructive non-confidence. If a majority of the Knesset, which is 61 or more, votes for another prime minister, then a new coalition is formed. So if today, the opposition in the Knesset is 56, which is 5 short of the 61 minimum, theoretically, if you have five members of the Likud who say, you know what? Bibi really got to go, and we are joining the constructive no confidence vote. Then Benny Gantz or Yair Lapid or someone else from the Likud may form an alternative coalition without Netanyahu. Now, I’m presenting it more easy than it really is in real life, but others might bring down the government, including some of his coalition partners who see him collapsing in the polls. And the gentleman who used to be the greatest asset, the greatest political asset, is becoming a great liability. And they’re beginning to distance themselves from him, distinguish themselves from his policy. And they might bring the government down, including one of the two lunatics, Smotrich or Ben-Gvir. Of the two, my money is more Ben-Gvir because he is both a street thug, not really an ideologue. He’s out for himself, and he thinks that he’s losing votes now to Smotrich, who, as minister of finance, is implementing his horrible agenda. While all eyes are on Gaza and Lebanon, he is doing horrible things on the West Bank and implementing the agenda, as you said, that he wrote in 2017, his plan for making sure that there is no two-state solution and that there is a one-state solution of a close to apartheid nature, where Palestinians are deprived of the right to vote for the Knesset. So he has no reason to leave because while everybody is busy, he’s doing his thing, and he’s promoting his agenda in a very impressive way, frighteningly so. But Ben-Gvir has already indicated to Netanyahu in more ways than one that he’s distancing himself, distinguishing himself, and if Netanyahu does something that provides him with an excuse that his base would applaud, he’s out.

So when you said a few minutes ago that you think within a few months, Netanyahu will be out, that is the pathway you see, that it’s this sort of constructive alternative approach?

nimrod novik

I’m less presumptuous than that. I can see various scenarios, and I have no idea which one of them will materialize. And I see the driver, unless it happens this way, the way I described it, internal Knesset by its own dynamics, the driver might be double the number of Israelis in the streets, double the number that we had last year — I’m sorry, earlier this year, when we used to have anywhere between 250,000, 300,000 on every Saturday night, which is huge for a country our size. It will double. And it will not be led by the leadership of the protest against the judicial coup, but rather, by the families of the victims and the hostages of October 6.

ezra klein

So there’s no doubt that a majority of Israelis see 10/7 as a failure of the government, a failure of Netanyahu. But do they see it the way you do, as a failure of the last 15 years of Israeli drift towards the right or towards apathy on Palestine? Do they see it as an indictment of ceasing to try to find some other kind of solution? Or is it the view that we just need tougher security, and we need a more competent government? We should never have missed the intelligence, right? You can imagine a way this could be interpreted that says, all we got wrong was incompetence. It was not a structural mistake that should make us re-engage with a very different policy towards Palestinians.

nimrod novik

I believe that there are three layers to public sentiment. Layer one was pre-October 7. And that was when you had a situation when 60 percent, 65 percent of the public opposed the judicial coup, and Likud was declining in the polls, you know that 60 percent, 65 percent in Israel is not the left. The residual left is negligible. 65 percent bites deep into the moderate right. And that was one layer of people were frightened by the effort to undermine our democracy, clearly visibly in the service of agendas that came from the far fringes of Israeli society, the most outrageous of homophobic, of annexationist, of messianic, of anti-Arab, including Israeli Arab citizens, of anti-women — you name it. The whole coalition of the fringes that was brought together only because they had one common denominator. They were willing to provide Netanyahu with legislated way out of his legal predicament in return for him allowing them to pursue their crazy respective agendas. All of them needed the supreme court to be weakened. So that was the initial common denominator. Served them all. So that was one layer of where the change from Bibi King, which he was, to selfish, “selling us out” Bibi King. The second was the impact of October 7, the day, the occasion. Suddenly, it was Bibi built Hamas. This monster was the product of a policy, deliberate policy, of funding Hamas, $35 million a month coming in suitcases. Every election eve, you said, the previous government failed to destroy Hamas. You will. And then you come to office time and time and time again, and you created that monster. So that was October 7, that layer two. Layer three is since October 7, when it turned out that not a single government ministry was able to rise to the occasion of performing its duties for the devastated population from the south, from those evacuated from the north, nothing. It was all voluntary organizations that organized the hotels for those whose homes were burned in the south and for those evacuated from the north that arranged for them. They left their homes with nothing, everything burned — clothes, food, medicine. They organized search and rescue in day one, two, and three. They brought in geniuses of high tech to develop on the spot an app that searched and rescued people. They organized the teams that went to the field to find those hiding somewhere. You can’t imagine the magnitude of voluntary energy that rose to the occasion. And suddenly people realized that when a prime minister appoint incompetent ministers just because of loyalty and legal problems, and those ministers appoint their own hacks to run their ministries, and they castrate the professionals, and when this goes on for year after year after year, then the professionals get tired of suggesting legitimate proposals, reforms, whatever. So suddenly, the realization of how his leadership deformed the entire government structure sunk in. There is a cumulative sense that he is responsible for a major disaster and therefore must go.

ezra klein

When you look at polls, his most likely successor is Benny Gantz. How does Gantz differ with Netanyahu in his broad approach to Palestinian issues?

nimrod novik

I would say that Gantz shares the ideas promoted by Commanders for Israel’s Security. Now it tells you that once a person is exposed to national security at the highest ranks with very few exceptions, they reached the same conclusions. It’s no brainer. If we don’t separate from the Palestinians, we are doomed. That’s 7 million Jews between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River and 7 million Arabs. Either they separate, or the Zionist dream is over. So the question is how to do it, how to do it in a secure way, in a careful way, with all kinds of safety valves in case things go wrong, and so on. So Benny Gantz shared the same ideas. So my question is not where is his heart or where is his mind. The question I ask myself is, is, he the leader to make it happen? And I, having watched so many leaders close by and from a distance, we cannot predict until one is tested. He has not been tested yet. If he makes it to the premiership, that will be the moment that we will find out if he is the one that will steer the ship in a reverse direction from where it is headed now.

ezra klein

I think one question that brings up is whether or not — forget the long-term horizon of a two-state solution. The short-term horizon of a revitalized Palestinian Authority, a more open and humane policy, is what people want. I mean, go all the way — and you know this history so much better than I ever will. But after the Oslo Accords, it’s a moment of great hope. Rabin is assassinated by a right-wing extremist, and then Shimon Peres, who was your boss, loses the election a few months later to Netanyahu. Power is traded back and forth for some time. Now Netanyahu has been back in power for quite some time, returning again later on with a very right-wing government. And there’s an argument that I hear from Palestinians that the Israeli people don’t want this. The Israeli public reveals what it wants by who it votes for, and it has repeatedly voted for Netanyahu and has been accepting of even more right-wing versions of Netanyahu than we initially saw. And if you look at polls of young Israeli Jews, they are more radical and more conservative and more dismissive of a two-state solution. How do you see that side of it, the actual question of what the Israeli public wants?

nimrod novik

At Commanders, for quite a few years, we’ve been commissioning public opinion polls for ourselves to study the issues. And since October 7, we’ve been discussing this with a group that we trust in terms of polling on a weekly basis to try and understand what’s the effect of the trauma is on Israeli public opinion. I’d like to say the following. First, in a macro approach, over the years, the conclusion that Israelis are sliding to the right on the Palestinian issue was an optical illusion. People took voting patterns to represent positions on issues, and it has not been the case for many, many years. Israelis did not vote the Palestinian issue. Israelis voted primarily Bibi yes, Bibi no, and maybe economy. The Palestinian issue was number six in the minds of the voter when he entered the polling booth. And you know better than I that number six and number five and number four and number three don’t determine one’s voting decision at the polls. It’s the number one and maybe two. Israelis had good reasons to vote for Netanyahu, who is a master politician and an exceptional campaigner with whom I disagree on everything. But I can understand why people would vote for him more than for his competitor. But when you check positions on the issues, you will find at least a plurality, if not a majority — depends on the circumstances and atmosphere of the time — of the four options on the Palestinian issue, which are annexation, status quo, civil separation without a deal with security control, and two-state solution. You will find at least a plurality and mostly a majority for the two pragmatic options. And this is consistent for years. Now, you ask them, how likely is this to happen in your lifetime, and they will tell you, no, it’s not, mostly because the other side is not a partner. And you have a mirror imaging of that on the Palestinian side. It’s not going to happen because of the Israelis. But if we had the Israeli leadership that will go for it, that decides that for Israel’s future, we have to separate from the Palestinians, they will have a majority support for it. So I don’t believe that the problem is the public, nor do I believe that the core issues of security, settlements, Jerusalem, borders, refugees are insurmountable. I think the problem is leadership.

ezra klein

I think that is the place to end. Always our final question, what are three books you would recommend to the audience?

nimrod novik

I was thinking of two books that are relevant to the moment. One is CIA Director Williams Bill Burns, “The Back Channel,” which is memoirs of an exceptional diplomat, but more than that, the lessons of the importance of diplomacy, the failures not to deploy it, and the successes when it is deployed rightfully. The second one, we just mourned the passing of Henry Kissinger, who invented shuttle diplomacy, or at least, invented the title, of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East. And Martin Indyk wrote an exceptionally good book called “The Master of the Game, Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy.”

"Gao Xiangjin used to know all the names of players in the American baskeball leagues, but since relations between the US and China soured, once-daily NBA broadcasts are now far less frequent. So Gao started watching China’s men’s basketball instead, until reports about corruption turned him off earlier this year. He now watches China’s women’s basketball, not on television, but on Douyin, the original, Chinese version of TikTok.

Gao is 69 years old, one of a growing cohort of elderly people who have moved away from television and gravitated to Douyin, China’s most popular short-form video app. There are 267 million people aged over 60 in China, according to official statistics, and while China’s government has tried to limit young people’s use of Douyin, worried about its addictive nature, many of the app’s habitual users are their parents, or even grandparents.

“Whenever he’s not cooking, swimming, or sleeping, he’s on Douyin,” his daughter Helen says. “It’s brainless entertainment. It’s better to be playing with a cat, it’s better to be doing anything else.” She’s not a Douyin user herself. “I already have attention problems,” she says. “Douyin would make that worse.”

A former soldier, Gao follows the Israel-Palestine crisis and the war between Ukraine and Russia through videos made by commentators. He shows me one where a political analyst translates headlines from English-language media outlets, such as The Times of Israel. He watches others for their analysis of military strategy.

While television broadcasts the official viewpoint, Gao says that on Douyin there are often videos from different camps putting their views across. The censors might get to them after a while, but it’s possible to witness a spectrum of opinions. Some of them are speaking with inside experience of the Party system, some are academics studying at Western universities, and others don’t disclose anything about their backgrounds; to many elderly users, they carry the same amount of authority.

Douyin is not just Gao’s source for news, but also basketball shoes. “Just look at those green shoes,” Helen says, gesturing to a pair of eye-catching sneakers on a shoe rack by local brand Tebu. “They’re ridiculous!”

Around once every five videos, Gao says, he gets an advert. Swiping on his phone, there’s a news video, then a woman pops up selling something, followed by news, news, news, then an advert for dates from Xinjiang. Gao is happy with his sneakers, paying just over $27 for them. He says that their quality is better than a pair he bought from Japan for more than four times the price.",technology

Wear what you're going to use at the interview in advance

and be comfortable.

Make sure that your handshake is proper.

Sat upright, good posture, eye contact,

but you are not staring them down.

[gentle upbeat music]

The human body is always transmitting.

The question is, who is receiving that information?

[upbeat music]

The interview really starts before the interview.

Outside the door already.

When someone hands in a CV or their social media.

When you're parking your car,

are you taking a space that is not allowed?

Are you greeting the security person that is standing there?

I remember going to an interview once

and the person that was gonna interview me

was in the elevator with me.

Sometimes I give CEOs the advice,

sit down on that reception stool

and observe the person who's coming in,

because then you can also already see

how they're treating reception staff.

We assess each other in milliseconds, not even seconds.

It's not just your body language or facial expressions,

it's everything that communicates.

Some people are making already, judgments.

You have to make a good impression,

first by understanding

that you have to make a good impression.

Selling yourself, you're promoting yourself.

So that's why you need to be confident

and be perceived as trustworthy, as well as competent.

Know what you're gonna say, what they're gonna ask you.

Prepare, prepare, prepare.

You don't have a copy of your CV and they refer to it,

you now look less prepared.

And if you hand it to somebody, hand it with value.

If you do it like this, you know,

a bit of the turtleneck like that,

completely different than this is who I am

and this is what I've done in life.

[upbeat music]

As I walk into the room, I have to remember

that I have to be respectful of that room.

Always make yourself known,

so you walk up to them, you shake hands.

Can I sit here? Yes, you can sit here.

I have to make eye contact with everybody in that room

and then I have to treat everybody equally.

And not focus on the chair that you want to sit in,

but focus on the people that are present in that room.

As you make your introduction,

I want to hear a strong voice.

I want to see an upright posture.

I wanna see the chin up.

Confidence.

No hands in pockets, I wanna see your hands.

I wanna see you ready to engage in an interaction.

I will shake everybody's hands equally,

not just gonna focus on the highest status person

or the leader.

[upbeat music]

If you ask most people,

Have you ever had a bad handshake?

They, yeah.

We all have had those awful handshakes.

Yeah, it was wet, weak, this, that, whatever.

If we are meeting up for the first time,

we align ourselves,

and that we have a short handshake, usually it's like this.

If you are giving me a very light handshake,

don't wanna be grabbing at the knuckles.

If you are giving me a really strong handshake,

I don't wanna give you a loose handshake back.

I'm going to try and match your level of grip.

Especially when you're a woman,

I've had so many bad handshakes

because of the strength that men probably want to portray,

I still don't understand.

People try and dominate a handshake,

never try and dominate a handshake.

But what we do see a lot,

too long, and they keep shaking like this all the time,

or they hold the hand, which makes it very uncomfortable.

Or they probe the hand,

which is the like the finger, like that.

Keep all of my fingers below your wrist.

So up to the point where they touch you here

or here, or even here,

and that we would not advise unless I know you very well.

It's like, Hey, how are you?

You know, then it's like, Oh, so good to see you, great.

Humans impress, first, visually,

then vocally, tone of voice, then verbally,

and the last is haptics through touch.

The brain catalogs all this negative stuff.

[upbeat music]

You have to let them set the stage and the rules.

Don't talk over them.

Turn yielding. Does this person ever shut up?

Some people start talking immediately.

Hi, I'm here for the job,

and they start selling themselves.

Take a breath, you know what you're doing,

and speak comfortably.

Depending on how many people you're talking to,

I would always wait just to let them take up the moment

of interaction and to tell them what they want from you.

Show you are engaged, you are actively listening,

and you are in the interaction present.

Use your hands and use your face to emphasize.

As they're talking,

and you want you to be nodding along

with what they're saying.

Not too much that you look like a bobble head.

You wanna have a slight head tilt

when you're talking to them,

especially when you're trying to show empathy.

When people ask a question, make sure you answer it.

Don't be so busy talking

that you are not aware that you've been asked a question.

I want to see you orientated towards them,

because orientation behavior shows interest.

Don't pick at your clothing,

don't pick out lint and so forth, don't preen yourself.

Even because they are uncomfortable,

you might see a self hug, you know those kind of things,

and we so do not advise that.

The best conversations take place

with comfort for both parties.

I'm overly sat with my shoulders back and my chest out

trying to be really, really upright,

I look like a robot.

If you are very comfortable like that,

that's not a good portray.

Will feel in your body when it feels unnatural.

Listen to yourself,

feel comfortable, and it should feel natural.

Everybody knows this,

but a lot of people don't do it.

Don't be caught off guard with any question.

Have a trial interview,

have somebody just ask you a few questions

and see how you come across,

and if you're clearing your throat

and you have to hesitate for too long,

people don't like that.

Hesitation is a killer.

[upbeat music]

Always say thank you.

Show them respect

by showing them you are grateful for their time.

Expect to, you know, say goodbye and shake hands.

Maybe hand out a card.

If not, you can just nod,

validate everybody that you had the opportunity.

This is the last time you have a chance to influence.

Remember, the interview is only over

when you are completely out of sight.

You leave the room with proactiveness

and a posture that shows you're active

or that you are energetic to go for what you want to go.

Often, if you feel that it went really well,

people can completely relax,

and they don't walk out the room with as much confidence

or as much poise as they came in the room.

You're only done after you're back in your car, home.

So maintain that confidence level,

maintain that posture, maintain that poise,

until you are fully out of the room.

[upbeat music]

When it comes to virtual interaction,

you're actually at an advantage.

There's actually a lot more control.

Is the lighting good? Is the sound okay?

Many people have learned the hard way

not to use the camera that came with their computer.

Go out and buy that or borrow a decent 4K camera.

You are in complete control of your virtual space,

so you can make sure that it's tidy,

that you don't have things that are drawing attention away.

There was somebody applying for a high-end job,

and in the background, there was only liquor.

It might be in his kitchen, so you can say,

Oh yeah, well, he's got liquor in his kitchen,

but we pick up on the liquor first,

and in our brain, we make an association.

Eye contact is really important virtually,

you just have to remember

that everything is now exaggerated.

Your gestures are now reduced to 27 inches.

That's what most cameras capture.

They can't look at the rest of your body,

so there's going to be more emphasis on the face.

The other difficult thing with Zoom is the technique.

So we have sometimes a delay of a question,

and that feels awkward sometimes.

Like, can I talk already or not?

And you see the hesitation,

the turn yielding is a bit delayed.

That can throw the interview, interviewee,

or the interviewer off,

so I have to be extra alert on that.

When they are talking, look at the screen,

and when you are talking, look at the camera.

What people often do is they look at themself.

When we are constantly assessing our own non-verbals,

it's really tiring

and it's really cognitively demanding and draining,

so it creates what's called Zoom fatigue,

and that will affect our non-verbals,

because we're going to show fatigue,

we're going to show disinterest.

In essence, the rules are the same.

The important thing is that you understand

that you have to be extra alert of your body language,

because there's no room for interpretations.

[upbeat music]

The goal of any interview

as the interviewer is information elicitation,

as the interviewee is to show confidence,

competence, and trust.

You're gonna create a conversation with that person,

or you're gonna ask questions as well,

or you will have examples that really apply to it.

You want to make the other person feel comfortable.

You want to make them feel

that you are someone to be trusted.

How did this person dress up?

Are your clothes clean or do you have food on your clothes?

I mean, I'm relaying here what I've heard from HR,

they're assessing you

because you're gonna be representing me.

We may have a great brand name,

but it's your face, your presence,

that's gonna make that difference.

There might be a hundred people applying for that job.

If you come prepared

and you have a genuine interaction

with showing that you really want it,

there's so much more chance in that setting

than, Oh, I'm just here, this is my resume,

yeah, please hire me.",technology
"Macron said Friday, during a visit to the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, that he didn’t regret what happened “at all.” | Pooled photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images

Emmanuel Macron is facing widespread pushback, even from within his own ranks, from critics who say the president breached France’s long-standing history of secularism after he attended a Jewish ceremony in the Élysée Palace on Thursday.

Macron had been invited to receive an award for fighting antisemitism and safeguarding religious freedoms at an annual event from the Conference of European Rabbis.

During the event, France’s chief rabbi Haïm Korsia lit a ceremonial candle as members of the audience sang traditional Hanukkah songs in Hebrew. Lighting candles on a multi-branched candelabra, called a menorah, is a Jewish ritual that is part of the Hanukkah celebrations, which this year began on Thursday and will last until next Friday.

Macron said Friday, during a visit to the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, that he didn’t regret what happened “at all.”

“I think that on this point we need to keep our heads cool,” the French president told reporters. “Secularism isn’t about erasing religions. It’s about the fact that everyone has the right and freedom to believe and not to believe.”

Because of the French state’s sacrosanct principle of being strictly secular, Macron’s presence at a religious ritual in an official building had sparked criticism from all sides — including from some Jewish groups.

Yonathan Arfi, president of the French Jewish federation CRIF who also attended the event, told radio broadcaster Sud Radio on Friday that the lighting of the candle was “a mistake” and “should not have happened.”

“The Élysée is not the place to light a Hanukkah candle because the Republican DNA is to stay away from anything religious,” Arfi added.

Pierre Henriet, an MP from Macron’s own centrist Renaissance party, “strongly condemn[ed] this attempt at religious preferences,” adding, “By this act, Emmanuel Macron breaks with his role as guarantor of the neutrality of the State.”

Manuel Bompard, a lawmaker from the far-left opposition France Unbowed (LFI) party, said Macron had made “an unforgivable political mistake.”

Laurence Rossignol, a socialist lawmaker who is vice president of the French Senate, compared Macron to “a 10-year-old kid [playing] with a little chemist’s kit, but [with] real nitroglycerine and real matches.”

The far-right National Rally, meanwhile, claimed that Macron’s attendance at the Élysée event was meant to make up for his absence at a march against antisemitism in November, which sparked criticism for the French president.

“By lighting a candle for the religious holiday of Hanukkah at the Elysée … Macron has scorned our Jewish compatriots and at the same time our secularism,” National Rally spokesperson Julien Odoul said. “This president will never have understood France.”

The display of religious signs in public spaces and by state officials is a particularly sensitive issue in France, where church and state have been strictly separated by law since 1905, which often ignites fiery political debates. The 118th anniversary of the law’s implementation will coincidentally be celebrated on Saturday.

In September, Macron was criticized for attending a mass given by Pope Francis, head of the Catholic Church, at a football stadium in Marseille.

The French president has also been under increasing pressure to show his support to French Jews following the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, which triggered massive Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip. A sharp rise in antisemitism has followed the escalation of war in the Middle East.

Faced with the mounting criticism, Macron’s lieutenants went to bat for him Friday morning.

The French president “is a defender of religions … he respects them all as head of state, and there is no violation of secularism,” Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin — in charge of religious affairs through his Cabinet role — told public broadcaster Franceinfo.",political
"Where do you think we placed Skyfall in our best Daniel Craig Bond movies list?

Spoilers follow for all five Daniel Craig Bond films.

It's hard to believe it's been over two years since Daniel Craig's final outing as James Bond. The British actor's five-movie stint as the legendary spy was a sight to behold, too, with many of Craig's outing being viewed as some of the best James Bond films of all-time.

But we're not here to compare Craig's time as 007 with his peers (you can read our James Bond actors ranked piece for our thoughts if you're curious). Instead, we've decided to rank each of Craig's Bond movies – from worst to best – to deliver a definitive guide on which ones we think are must-see and which ones you're safe to skip.

Of course, this is just our take on the Craig 007 film era – lists like this are always subjective, so you might not necessarily agree with our ranking. If nothing else, it creates a spicy discussion, so be sure to let us know your thoughts on social media.

Anyway, here's our complete rundown of every Daniel Craig James Bond film ranked, including details on where you can stream each one if you're planning a festive season re-watch. Enjoy!

5. Quantum of Solace

Despite being impacted by the 2008 writers strike, Quantum of Solace is a hot mess. (Image credit: MGM Studios/Sony Pictures)

Where to stream: Prime Video/MGM Plus (US), rent or buy (UK), Prime Video/Stan (Australia)

An obvious choice for bottom spot, although some may consider that to be unfair. Quantum of Solace’s development was hit hard by the 2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which led to some of its biggest scenes being written and shot on the day they were filmed.

Even with those mitigating circumstances, Quantum of Solace isn’t a top tier Bond movie. It’s overstuffed with product placement, the film’s villain – Mathieu Amalric’s Dominic Greene – and theme song ('Another Way to Die' by Jack White and Alicia Keys) are largely forgettable, and its plot is messy. The movie’s editing, too, hampers its story and makes for a disjointed entry.

There are some things to like about Quantum of Solace. Craig does a good job as an emotionally wounded Bond out for revenge after the events of Casino Royale. Judi Dench’s M delivers a memorable performance, too, as the moral counterpoint to Craig’s 007. As the shortest Bond flick ever made, Quantum of Solace also boasts a distinct but welcome lack of filler material and elaborate exposition.

Quantum of Solace may have suffered from events outside of its control, as well as being the follow-up to the much lauded Casino Royale, but it loses sight of the series’ ‘license to thrill’ mantra. Bond movies are supposed to be enjoyable affairs and, this one isn't.

4. Spectre

Spectre should've been better than it is. (Image credit: Sony Pictures/MGM Studios)

Where to stream it: Fubo (US), rent or buy (UK), Prime Video/Stan (Australia)

Sam Mendes’ second Bond flick has some stand-out moments, but there are simply better 007 flicks in Craig’s run.

Like Quantum of Solace, Spectre fails to live up the lofty heights set by predecessor Skyfall. That’s a shame, too, because it opens with a memorably spectacular sequence set during Mexico City's Día de Muertos celebrations, before picking up some of the previous movies’ loose threads, and ties them together in fairly captivating fashion.

Unfortunately, Spectre’s story sags at the crucial moment. One of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood prior to the film’s release, the reveal of Blofeld (played by Christoph Waltz) is nowhere near as impactful as it should have been. Also, the entire Sahara-based sequence is neither poignant nor thrilling enough – though the subsequent explosive set-piece is undeniably striking.

Spectre does finish strongly, thanks to the intimately thrilling spectacle of its London-based denouement. Bond’s character development throughout the film, especially in its final few scenes, shows how much 007 has grown during the Craig era, although this is a mid-tier Bond film rather than an all-time great.

3. No Time to Die

Craig’s final outing as 007 is a fitting end to the actor’s time in the famous tuxedo, as we explain in our spoiler-free review of No Time to Die.

It’s unexpectedly funnier than it ought to be, comes packaged with its fair share of stylish set-pieces, and features numerous plot twists that keep you on your toes. There are even a couple of sinister, almost horror-esque moments that add a semblance of originality to proceedings, too.

But, gloriously fun as it is, No Time to Die isn’t without its niggles. Its two-and-a-half hour runtime is too long, while its villain – Rami Malek's Lyutsifer Safin – isn’t as absorbing or malicious as previous Bond villains.

It doesn’t help that Safin becomes a sideshow next to the film’s wider narrative. Admittedly, No Time to Die is the culmination of a five-movie 007 arc, so there needs to be enough room for its hero to get the send off he deserves. Even so, the best Bond movies have iconic villains that give as good as they get, and Safin fails to deliver on that front.

That all said, No Time to Die gets more right than it gets wrong. It’s a pleasing Bond flick that wraps up the Craig era in style. And, with its poignant and heart-breaking conclusion – hands up who saw that coming? – it delivers a bold finale that’s sure to leave many fans teary eyed as Louis Armstrong’s iconic 'We Have All The Time In The World' plays out over the closing credits.

2. Casino Royale

Fans and critics had low expectations for Casino Royale ahead of its November 2006 release, particularly after the unfair backlash that had accompanied Daniel Craig's appointment as the new 007.

But Casino Royale surprised us all, cutting back on the traditional gags and superb James Bond gadgets to deliver a grittier, more grounded reinvention of the legendary spy. Craig inhabited the role with a brooding intensity and impish charm that many hadn’t predicted, and portrayed Bond as a more flawed character than previous iterations. The film also laid the foundations for the introspective evolution of the character we’ve witnessed since, with Bond’s morality and true identity placed front and center.

Every Bond movie needs a strong supporting cast to help it succeed, and Casino Royale’s was one of the best in recent memory. Eva Green’s electric performance as femme fatale Vesper Lynd stole the show, while Mads Mikkelsen and Jeffrey Wright ably backed Craig and Green as the villainous Le Chiffre and CIA agent Felix Leiter, respectively.

Add in plenty of high-octane action sequences, unbearable suspense – who can forget that torture scene? – and an ill-fated love story that set up Craig’s entire arc as 007, and Casino Royale is deserving of its second-placed finish here. Sure, it borrowed plenty from the at-the-time successful Jason Bourne film series, but it breathed new life into the Bond franchise when some had assumed its best days were behind it.

1. Skyfall

You might have guessed this would take first place, but Skyfall really is the king of the Daniel Craig era.

There are many reasons why. For one, Bond is, for much of Skyfall’s runtime, out of his depth and out of practice as an MI6 agent. It’s riveting to see a Bond who isn’t at the peak of his powers, thanks to events that transpire in Skyfall’s opening sequence. We see him run physical, mental and psychological gauntlets as he struggles to stop Raoul Silva (played with enthralling menace by Javier Bardem) and his grand plan from coming to fruition.

That includes Bond’s failure to save Judi Dench’s M during Skyfall’s thrilling and climactic final 30 minutes, plus the final confrontation – set amid the backdrop of Bond’s eponymous childhood home in the Scottish Highlands – that's simultaneously picturesque and unbearably tense. Like No Time to Die, it has horror trappings that create extra suspense throughout.

Above all, Skyfall resonated most strongly with audiences because of its overarching theme of family. Sam Mendes explores Bond’s past (via his return to his former abode), his present (through his surrogate family at MI6), and his future (as he contemplates life after the passing of his mother-figure, M). M's send-off is appropriately memorable, too, putting a well-earned cap on a character arc that stretches back to the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movie era.

Like Casino Royale, Skyfall lifts stylistic and thematic elements from 2008’s The Dark Knight – Mendes has previously confirmed as much. Alongside Roger Deakins’ superb cinematography and the reintroduction of classic Bond gadgets and characters like Q, these elements combined to make Skyfall a cinematic marvel.

It’s an espionage thriller that gets under your skin and takes you on a wild ride, so it’s unsurprising that it’s the highest-grossing Bond flick of all-time. Few 007 movies can match it and, if Craig had bowed out of the role after Skyfall’s release (as originally intended), it would have been the perfect way to end his tenure.

"For the past five years, the US Department of Justice has reportedly been investigating the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, for suspected money laundering, unlicensed money transmission and criminal sanctions violations. But now, according to a report in Bloomberg, the DoJ is willing to settle. For $4 billion.

Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg says that the DoJ has entered into negotiations with Binance over the structure of the deal, which may take the form of a deferred prosecution agreement, under which the agency would file criminal charges against Binance, but decline to follow through provided the exchange meets certain criteria and pays the proposed financial penalty. The agreement would not necessarily prevent the DoJ from pursuing criminal charges against Changpeng Zhao, Binance CEO, but—crucially—would allow the exchange to remain operational. Neither the DoJ nor Binance returned a request for comment.

Binance would have been an enormous scalp for the DoJ, which has signaled a desire—along with US regulatory agencies—to tame the wild west of the crypto industry. But the choice to pursue a settlement rather than a trial may come down to a concern for the exchange’s users and the extent of its entrenchment in the crypto industry. Hundreds of thousands of regular people would be caught in the fallout if the company were to collapse under the weight of a conviction.

A deferred prosecution agreement, says Paul Tuchmann, a former US prosecutor and partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana, is typically deployed in cases where the DoJ determines “the collateral consequences of a criminal prosecution of a corporation are not worth it.” Taken into consideration will be the scope of potential “damages to innocent parties,” says Tuchmann, which might include “shareholders, employees, or consumers of the company’s services.” In short: Binance has become too big to fail.

It is “generally not the DoJ’s policy to want to put somebody out of business,” says Tuchmann.

At the height of its popularity in February 2023, shortly after the failure of rival firm FTX, Binance was responsible for as much as 66 percent of crypto trading activity taking place over centralized exchanges (as opposed to peer-to-peer platforms) worldwide. By October, its market share had fallen below 40 percent, but Binance remains by far the largest exchange in the world by transaction volume.",technology
"Tesla is suing Sweden as the carmaker hits back at an attempt by local unions to disrupt its business in an ongoing battle over workers’ rights.

In the lawsuit, filed Monday, Tesla says it is suing “the Swedish state through the Swedish Transport Agency” because local union members were refusing to deliver new license plates to the company, effectively blocking Tesla from selling new cars in the country. In a quick decision, the Norrköping district court said the company should be allowed to circumvent existing rules and collect its license plates itself. The Swedish Transport Agency has 14 days to respond to the decision.

Swedish unions describe their fight against Tesla as existential for the Swedish labor market. Sweden doesn’t have laws that dictate workers’ rights, such as minimum wage. Instead, around 90 percent of Swedish workers are covered by collective agreements, a type of contract that regulates the relationship between employers and their employees, including pay, pensions, and working hours. Tesla’s refusal to sign a collective agreement with its mechanics has enraged union bosses, who are worried the company could set a precedent.

“It’s the whole system that is at stake,” says Tommy Wreeth, chairman of the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union, whose members are refusing to unload Tesla cargo at Swedish ports. “That’s why all Swedish unions see this as a crucial fight.”

License plates stopped being delivered to Tesla when Seko, the Swedish union representing postal workers, joined a countrywide blockade against the company on November 20. Seko said its members would not deliver post, parcels, or pallets to Tesla until it signed a collective agreement with Swedish car mechanics, who have been on strike since October 27. Tesla filed a separate lawsuit against the Nordic postal service PostNord in an attempt to get the company to release its packages.

The lawsuits are part of a growing crisis in Sweden, with more unions joining action against Tesla. The revolt started with the union representing the mechanics, IF Metall, but other Swedish unions have since introduced “sympathy measures” in an attempt to force the company to sign. Swedish cleaners are refusing to clean Tesla showrooms, electricians won’t fix the company’s charging points, and dockworkers are refusing to unload Tesla cargo at Swedish ports.

“We note that Tesla has chosen to take the long route, starting legal proceedings,” says Veli-Pekka Säikkälä, national bargaining secretary at IF Metall. “There is a simple and quick way to solve this situation, and that is to sign a collective agreement. As soon as Tesla does that, the conflict ends.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented publicly on the Swedish blockade for the first time last week, calling the situation “insane” in a comment on X. But the lawsuit is the first sign that Tesla’s business in Sweden—its fifth largest European market—has been affected by the blockade.

“[It tells us] they are desperate,” claims Jonas Pettersson, a spokesperson for Seko, adding he hopes the company will sign a collective agreement with IF Metall in due course. Tesla did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment.

Sweden’s transport agency has not yet seen the lawsuit, according to spokesperson Mikael Andersson, but he confirmed it had been submitted. “Tesla believes that the Swedish Transport Agency does not meet the requirement to provide registration plates to newly registered vehicles in Sweden,” he says. “We at the Swedish Transport Agency do not share this view.” The agency is neutral in the conflict, Andersson adds.

The lawsuit was filed three days after workers at a Swedish factory that makes Tesla parts and sends them to the company’s gigafactory in Berlin joined the blockade. On Friday, around 50 unionized workers employed by a Swedish subsidiary of the Norwegian company Hydro stopped working on Tesla products at the company’s plant in Vetlanda, in southern Sweden.

“As of November 24, the production of certain products at the plant is affected by what is a legal union action in Sweden,” says Hydro spokesperson Halvor Molland. He declined to comment on whether the blockade had impacted shipments to Tesla’s factory in Berlin.",technology

"Choosing the best coffee maker is essential to ensuring that your first cup of coffee in the morning is just how you like it. A flat white in your local café may be convenient, but nothing beats a fresh home brew, after all.

There’s a wide range of espresso machines available to buy online with big name brands such as Nespresso, Smeg and Delonghi offering bean-to-cup, pod and ground coffee machines that make intense espressos with a rich crema. You can alternatively find drip-filter coffee makers such as the Moccamaster KBGV Select that produce tall Americanos, which we rate very highly in our best coffee maker round up.

But while coffee can be produced from the same coffee bean, which type of coffee machine you choose impacts the taste, strength and quality of your brew. This makes it important to consider the options before you buy.

With so many to consider, finding the perfect machine can be rather daunting – particularly as the latest models don’t come cheap. If you’re reading this article, chances are you’ve already got your eye on an espresso machine or drip-filter coffee maker. Each type will give you two different drinking experiences so which coffee machine is right for you and your household? To help you choose between the two, we pit coffee makers vs espresso machines here.

Coffee maker vs espresso machine: Price

The price of your coffee machine all depends on the brand name you choose, the style and finish of your machine, and overall quality of the design. While prices can vary dramatically between designs, drip-filter coffee makers are usually the cheaper option compared to a standard espresso machine.

The prices for drip-filter coffee makers can range anywhere between $25 / £25 / AU$50 for a model such as the Dominion 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker to around $350 / £350 / AU$650 for the Moccamaster KBGV Select , for example. Espresso machines, on the other hand, are much less budget-friendly, with the entry price for a basic espresso machine costing around the $50 / £50 / AU$95 mark.

Depending on how versatile the design and whether it has extras such as a milk frother, for example, you can expect to pay anything up to $1,500 / £1,500. Bear in mind, however, that prices fluctuate dramatically throughout the year with impressive bargains to enjoy at peak sale times such as Black Friday and the January sales.

Coffee maker vs espresso machine: Design

While flat whites, frothy cappuccinos and gingerbread lattes with all the cream and marshmallows you can fit inside may sound fun, but sometimes a simple Americano is all you need. If you prefer a no-fuss black coffee, a drip filter coffee machine may just be the right choice for you. Offering you a simple way to make black Americano coffee that can be easily poured from a carafe, drip filter coffee makers provide the ideal route to that perfect cup of joe. But bear in mind that drip filter coffee makers don’t tend to come with an integrated milk warmer/frother, so if you want your Americano with milk you’ll need to warm some milk up separately. The Ninja DualBrew Pro is an exception, however.

Drip-filter designs are attractive as they are convenient, and you don’t have to worry about tying yourself into a coffee pod brand or recycling the pods. Many of the best designs have insulated carafes and programmable timers. You can use the timer to set your machine to start working before you wake up in the morning so that your coffee is freshly brewed and ready for you when you enter your kitchen. Some designs also have a hot plate that stays on for a set time after you’ve made a brew, so your coffee keeps hot. How long the hot plate stays on for varies from model to model so check before you buy. The Cuisinart DGB-650BC Grind & Brew Automatic is an exception, however, as it has an insulated carafe instead of a hot plate, which does a great job at keeping your coffee hot and is less likely to leave your coffee tasting stewed.

If you buy an espresso maker that either takes pods, filter coffee or freshly ground beans, you’re in for a different experience. Espresso machines are more complex in design compared to your standard drip filter coffee maker. They come with spouts that produce single or double shot espressos – so you can make two coffees at the same time. Many designs also come with an integrated milk frother or steam wand so that you can add milk to your coffee and use ‘micro-foam’ to create barista style coffee with latte art. Some espresso machines such as the Seattle Coffee Gear Diletta Bello Espresso Machine even have a hot water dispenser, which is a handy extra when you want instant hot water for green teas and hot chocolates.

Espresso makers give you much more flexibility when it comes to the type of coffee drink you can produce. Some of the best models have digital controls to make it easy for you to select your drink type, variable grind settings so you can adjust the strength of your coffee, and variable water tank sizes. While they all aim to deliver the same end goal – to produce a rich-tasting espresso with thick crema on top – you can read about the differences in the type of machines in our bean-to-cup coffee machines vs espresso machines feature here.

Coffee maker vs espresso machine: Performance

The flavour and strength of your coffee will vary greatly depending on which type of coffee machine you choose, but drip filter coffee makers produce the taller and weaker drink. The two types of coffee machines work very differently to produce the end result – a delicious cup of coffee.

For drip filter coffee makers, you can choose between designs that grind whole beans or ones that use a paper filter and take ground coffee. Either option gives you the flexibility to use your favorite coffee roast – be it a smooth Colombian or rich Italian coffee – to brew a delicious Americano coffee. Drip filter coffee makers work by pouring hot water over the ground coffee so that it absorbs the flavour and oils of the beans and then drips through the spout and into the carafe. Some believe that by using a filter, it reduces sediments in your drink and produces a smoother cup of coffee with the brewing process highlighting the more intricate flavours of the coffee.

Unlike most espresso machines, not all drip filter coffee makers allow you to adjust the size (and potentially strength) of your coffee, however. The Ninja DualBrew Pro is one of the exceptions, giving you a brew size range from 4oz to 55oz, so you can brew just how much coffee you desire as you go.

Espresso coffee machines, on the other hand, can produce a far more intense and aromatic ‘shot’ of double or single espresso. Espresso coffee uses a finer, powder-like grind as compared to a coffee maker and very high pressure to force water through the coffee within seconds. This results in a much richer and shorter finish, delivering a thick ‘crema’ on top of the espresso that you just won’t get from a regular coffee maker.

Winner: Draw – it’s all a matter of taste

Coffee maker vs espresso machine: Which is right for you?

There are some notable differences in the way a drip filter coffee maker works compared to an espresso maker. To make it easier to decide between the two, it’s important to think about how you like your coffee in the morning. For a flavoursome tall and clean Americano a coffee maker is a great choice, but for shorter ‘shots’ of espresso with a rich crema an espresso maker is ideal.",technology
"“I think art is what makes us human,” says Dr. Clara Nellist, a particle physicist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. “Pure scientific curiosity … I compare it to art.”

It’s this human curiosity, this pursuit of art, that drives Dr. Nellist, who helped develop the pixel detector for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC.) In her everyday work, she doesn’t see a demarcation line between art and science. Trying to understand the world around you, just for the sake of understanding it, is art.

“One of the oldest questions is just, ‘What is this made of?’” she says. “You can kind of say that the [Large Hadron Collider] is a giant microscope. We’re going down to the very smallest things that could possibly make up the building blocks of the universe.” The science that Dr. Nellist has dedicated her life and career to aims to answer these fundamental questions.

It Doesn’t Have to Be Art Versus Science

“Honestly, at school, I didn’t really know what physics was,” Dr. Nellist says, with a laugh. “It’s a bit embarrassing.” At her schools growing up, the teachers were excellent but didn’t have many resources. ”We had a science teacher, and they were enthusiastic, but I knew biology was plants and chemistry was chemicals, and physics was the other one that involved like pushing things down ramps.” But eventually, when it came time for her A levels, Dr. Nellist decided she wanted to do physics. There was just one problem: Her school didn’t offer it.

Her mother, a primary school teacher, encouraged young Clara to pursue physics, even if it made things a bit more difficult. “I registered to do physics at a different school and went there for lessons twice a week. I enjoyed it, but honestly my best grade was English, not physics,” she says. “Physics I found challenging, but in a really good way.”

Dr. Nellist’s parents also influenced her in other significant ways: “I grew up with parents who were very vocal about things that weren’t good. I learned from them that we have to try to stand up and change things,” she explains. It’s why she speaks out about diversity and inclusivity in STEM fields and is inspired by those around her. “I’m very grateful also to the people that have made a difference before me and that are continuing to make a difference now, because they also give me the strength to speak up.”

When it came time for university, Dr. Nellist was still struggling between physics and English, but she eventually decided on physics. Her favorite thing about English was reading books, which she could do at home. “But for physics, no one was going to let me build a lab in my house,” she says.",technology
"His case demonstrates that Cuba remains a potent and far-reaching player in the world of espionage — and a security threat often overlooked by U.S. officials as other conflicts and antagonists consume oxygen in Washington, according to Jim Popkin, an expert on Cuban espionage, and the author of Code Name Blue Wren: The True Story of America’s Most Dangerous Female Spy―and the Sister She Betrayed.

“We have underestimated [Cuba] in terms of intelligence capabilities over the years, and also when it comes to things like patience, smarts, determination, we really have underestimated them,” Popkin, an award-winning investigative journalist, told POLITICO Magazine.

“The Cubans are really good at espionage.”

Since the end of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba’s government has utilized its proximity to the U.S. as a conduit to geopolitical relevance, cultivating a sophisticated spy network in Washington and other Western capitals and selling its intelligence findings to friendly regimes around the world, including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

Unlike other countries, which usually recruit spies through bribes and blackmail, Cuba appeals to ideology, sourcing its spies among academics and U.S. officials sympathetic to the liberationist aims and ambitions of the Castro regime. In 2007, federal law enforcement arrested two professors at Florida International University, accusing them of spying on Cuban exile groups in Miami for the Castro regime. And in 2009, Kendall Myers, a Europe analyst in the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and his wife were arrested on charges of passing along classified information to Havana.

Until Rocha’s arrest, the most damaging case of Cuban espionage was that of Ana Belen Montes, a senior analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency who was arrested in September 2001 and convicted of spying for Havana for over 17 years. At the time of her arrest, she was positioned to have extensive access to U.S. military plans during the war in Afghanistan.

Rocha’s case, Popkin said, “is just yet another example of how incredibly skilled [Cubans] have been.”

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What surprised you the most about this arrest?

It’s really an amplification of what I thought: the Cubans are really good at espionage. Their intelligence agency, which goes by the acronym DGI, is incredibly effective. And they take the long game. If you look at Rocha, in his case, you know, the allegation here is that he starts with the State Department in 1981. But he’s already been recruited by the Cubans before he even applies to the State Department. It appears that they met him maybe in Chile as early as 1973. That’s just conjecture, based on the criminal complaint, but they definitely got him on their radar in the 70s, or maybe the early 80s, and then they helped him apply for a job at the State Department.

This is a patient, clever bunch of intelligence experts working on behalf of the Cuban government to have, that kind of fortitude and patience to put someone in and wait that long, in this case with Rocha, on and off. He’s been affiliated by his own admission with Cuba for more than 40 years. And the fact that this never came out until this past week is really remarkable. It’s to me a testament to the skill set of the Cuban intelligence agency, the DGI.

A lot of things stand out to me. One, how high ranking he was, and also the length of time he was spying. What was more unusual, the fact he was so high ranking, or that he went undetected for so long?

I would go with high ranking in this case. Keep in mind, he only had about 20 years of service at the State Department, the rest of his spying allegedly took place when he was in the private sector afterwards, including a stint advising SOUTHCOM, which oversees Cuba, for the military. But yeah, it’s very unusual for an ambassador to be accused of a crime of this nature. I would argue that Montes was a really important analyst, she was a GS-14, I believe, when she was at DIA, she was a top analyst and thought of as one of the U.S. government’s very top experts on Cuba in general. To have her compromised, a Cuba expert working for the U.S. government, but secretly working for Castro, was a big deal.

Prior to Rocha, you had Kendall Myers, who was a State Department official, a career diplomat. He and his wife were also convicted of spying for Cuba. You also had Ana Montes’ basically partner in crime and the woman who first identified her, Marta Velazquez. Velasquez met Montes at SAIS, at the Johns Hopkins international school in D.C. She was already working for the Cubans at that time, identified her as a good recruit, and then traveled with her to New York to meet her Cuban contact and officially signed on up as an asset for Cuba. Later Marta Velazquez was a lawyer and later went to work for USAID all over the world.

Rocha does distinguish himself, and is surprising, because he was an ambassador. You know, at the end of his career, he became the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia. He had top secret clearance. Part of what the government, our government, is doing right now is trying to assess, what did this guy reveal? Because he certainly would have known the names of undercover operatives working for the U.S. in Cuba, he would have known about top secret programs that we were running against the Cubans, and presumably others in the region as well. So even though he left the State Department in 2002, I’m sure there’s a damage assessment that’s going on right now to try to figure out what he revealed in his 20 years of government service.

What kinds of information does Cuba want about the United States? And do you think Rocha throughout his career would have been able to supply it?

Definitely. He worked all over Central and South America, all places that the Cubans care a lot about, like Mexico City. He worked for the U.S. in what is essentially like our embassy, the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. He was well placed in locations that would have directly benefited the Cubans. So he definitely had access to all kinds of juicy information that the Cubans would have loved.

Especially when Fidel Castro was alive, for good reason, he was obsessed with the notion that the United States might invade or attack his country as we had in the Bay of Pigs. So that was probably the number one thing that the Cubans wanted to know: is there an active threat and what are the details of any potential threat against the country?

One of the incidents that is mentioned in the criminal complaint and I write about it in my book as well, was the shoot down of civilian planes called Brothers to the Rescue. Rocha was at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana when this whole episode unfolded and Montes was also heavily involved with this at the same time. On the U.S. side, she was in the Pentagon and briefing generals about this same incident. So they both would have had access to information and would have been able to provide Cuba with details about a possible U.S. response.

The key thing to remember is that this happened under the Clinton administration. Clinton was under an enormous, enormous amount of pressure to act and to either bomb bases in Cuba, or maybe something even more extreme than that, because here the Cubans had shot down civilian planes supposedly not over Cuban airspace, although there was always some debate about where the planes were at the time. The Cubans were terrified that Clinton was going to either invade the island, or bomb them in retaliation.

We know that as an example, Montes’ Cuban handler showed up unannounced in the Cleveland Park neighborhood in Washington, D.C,. to quiz her about what she was learning, moment by moment, at the Pentagon. That was a big security breach for her handler to show up in D.C. in this neighborhood, right by the National Zoo, and out in the open, confront her and ask her what was going on. That was just an example of how paranoid they were at the time. So if Rocha also had inside information, and he’s in Havana, he presumably would have been meeting with his handler in Havana, and passing on the information that he had.

That was the main thing that the Cubans wanted to know: are we going to be invaded? Is the U.S. going to target us? Are they going to try to assassinate Fidel or Raul Castro? Those are the things that were kind of foremost on their minds.

Do you think that Americans underestimate Cuba as an adversary? And if so, in what ways?

That’s a really important question. I do. I think that we have underestimated Cuba for a long time. In terms of a military, they’re not much to speak of compared to the United States. They have been a threat regionally in Africa and Latin American countries where they’ve gotten involved over the past decades. But you know, as a threat to the U.S., a direct threat there, not much in terms of their military.

So they spend an enormous amount of money on their intelligence service. I had an FBI agent, a former FBI supervisor, tell me that he was almost jealous of the Cubans and their ability to work with their own spy network without any real rules at all. They don’t have Congress breathing down their neck. There’s no oversight. And their sole enemy is the United States — unlike in our case, where we’re worried about all kinds of friends and enemies all over the world. In Cuba, they can focus like a laser on the United States. So instead of spending an enormous amount of money on their military, they overspend on their intelligence service and without any of the same rules and regulations that the CIA is an example.

We have underestimated Cuba in terms of intelligence capabilities over the years, and also things like patience, smarts, determination, we really have underestimated them. And this Rocha case is just yet another example of how incredibly skilled they have been.

What role does ideology play in recruitment? And how do they find people to spy for them?

The Cubans have a track record of looking for potential recruits at a very young age. Marta Velazquez was at Princeton University as an undergrad and wrote her senior thesis on Cuba and went to Cuba. It’s likely that the Cubans first met her then as an undergraduate. By the time she gets to SAIS, she’s already met with the Cubans. And she’s recruited and working for them as a spotter of new talent. Ana Montez is in graduate school and is identified by Marta and the Cubans in graduate school as a young woman in her 20s.

That is their M.O. They scour American graduate schools, and many other places as well, but they are primarily looking for ideological recruits who just believe in the cause.

And Rocha appears to be one of those. By his own words to the FBI, and diplomatic security at the State Department, he’s told them that he believed in the cause and he speaks glowingly of Castro and the revolution and the regime. And he said that he created a legend, a story about himself, where he poses as basically like a MAGA Republican, even though in his heart, he supports a Communist ideology. So it’s really fascinating and, again, just goes to the skill of the Cubans — find young people who believe in the cause, you don’t have to pay them very much, if anything at all, and let them go to work for you. And in Rocha’s case, apparently, it continued for 42 years.

That anti-Cuba hardliner and MAGA Republican image, is that a typical M.O. that Cuban spies have adopted over the years? Or was this a unique kind of cover for Russia?

I’m not familiar with any other Cuban recruits who’s posed as a MAGA Republican or even you know, even a hardline conservative. In Montes’ case that was not her identity. She, if anything, tried to be mostly neutral, and occasionally would speak a little bit about her ideology. But in her case, she just thought she should just keep her head down and not really comment too much on politics. And she mostly didn’t. That was mostly true as well of Kendall Meyers.

Maybe they show their colors a little bit. But in this case, Rocha created a whole facade and a scenario where he’s a hardcore Republican to the public, but in private, in reality, he’s supporting a communist regime. I’m not familiar with anyone else doing that, at least in recent history.

Many Americans think about Cuba through a Cold War foreign policy lens. What do you think that most people don’t know about Cuba right now and its placement in the security landscape?

The problem is no one thinks about Cuba anymore. We’re very focused on Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and nuclear powers in the national security context. Cuba’s an afterthought, often.

I’m sure what national security experts are looking at right now is — these examples that I’ve cited, these four examples, are all pretty ancient at this point. In Rocha’s case going back at least till 1981. Montes was recruited a couple years later in the 1980s. Is that a vestige of the Castro-run communist regime in Cuba? Or, are they still doing the exact same thing today?

They were very focused and obviously incredibly successful in the 1980s in identifying and placing young people in our government who then worked hard and rose up the ranks. Are they still doing the same thing today? Indications are yes. But I can’t say that they’re doing so with the same skills and success level as they showed in the 1980s.

How closely is Cuba aligned to Russia these days? Back in the Cold War era, the Soviets were the biggest customer. Is Russia still a big customer of Cuban intelligence?

Russia is definitely a customer of Cuban intelligence. But, their relationship has definitely shifted over the years. Russia used to pretty much prop up the Cuban economy and they’ve scaled way back on that. The fear about Cuba, one of the reasons why Cuba remains a serious threat, is that information that they steal doesn’t stay in Cuba.

They have a track record of selling it to the Russians or to other adversaries, U.S. adversaries. So it doesn’t just end on the island, it could easily go to Russia. That was one of the fears in the Montes case. She was arrested 10 days after 9/11. And it’s because she had gotten her hands, or was about to get her hands, on our bombing targets in Afghanistan. The FBI and others were very concerned that if she had learned of specific bombing targets in Afghanistan, she would have provided that information to Cubans. And who knows what the Cubans would have done with that, would they have sold it to the Russians or the Taliban?

Unclear, but the government didn’t want to ever be put in that position. And that’s why the DIA forced her arrest, just 10 days after 9/11 to get her out of DIA and away from that very sensitive bombing targeting information.

What questions are you asking about this case now? What are you looking out for as more details are coming out about the Rocha case?

I want to know, was he paid? We’ve not yet seen evidence of that, whether this is strictly ideological, or whether he also was paid along the way. I obviously want to know details on what information he provided that may be difficult to ascertain, unless he fully cooperates because he quit the government in 2002.

I’d love to know how he was recruited. He was born in Colombia but is a naturalized U.S. citizen. When did he decide and what was his rationale? He visited Cuba several times recently. What was the purpose of that?

I’m curious to know what information he provided when he was advising SOUTHCOM, which is basically our military base that oversees Cuba. And we also don’t know whether any information that he provided ever led to the death or injury of any Cubans or any Americans working in Cuba.

In the case of Montes, no one is known to have been arrested or killed but we don’t know that about Rocha yet. And that would obviously really elevate his importance as a spy and also the level of concern from our government about him.",political
"“He always talked about ‘infrastructure week,’ four years of ‘infrastructure week,’ but it failed — he failed,” Mr. Biden said, referring to Mr. Trump. “On my watch, instead of infrastructure week, America’s having ‘infrastructure decade.’”

The shift comes as officials for the Biden campaign have taken an interest in trying to use Mr. Trump, and his actions and words both during and after his presidency, as a foil to bolster Mr. Biden’s re-election effort. That strategy is one that some other elected Democrats across the country have been less keen on, arguing that Mr. Biden needs to do more to promote his own accomplishments while in office.

A poll released last month by The New York Times and Siena College found that Mr. Trump was leading Mr. Biden in Nevada by 10 points, the largest margin across six critical battleground states surveyed.

Mr. Trump, who in most national polls leads the field of Republican primary candidates by more than 40 percentage points, will hold a rally in Reno later this month.

Mr. Biden’s visit to Las Vegas came on the heels of two tragedies in the state: the killing of two state troopers in a hit-and-run last week, and a shooting on Wednesday at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, that killed three faculty members. Mr. Biden was scheduled to meet with the university’s president and some of its students and other community members before delivering his remarks on the infrastructure funding, according to the White House.",political
"In what’s becoming increasingly common for Fortnite, the game is fusing with one of the biggest pop culture properties around. This time around, it’s Lego. But the launch of Lego Fortnite is also much more involved than the typical tie-in — and the start of what seems like a new era for Fortnite.

Lego Fortnite is a survival crafting game that’s available inside of Fortnite starting today. It’s sort of like a Lego version of Minecraft, only instead of downloading a whole new game, you just select a tile from the Fortnite menu the same way you would when you hop into battle royale.

I was able to play around 30 minutes of the game earlier in the week, and it’s very impressive, if somewhat familiar. Players are given a large, procedurally generated map to explore — Epic says that it’s 19 times larger than the battle royale island, which just got a refresh — and you can play in a creative mode, where you build whatever you like, or a survival mode, where skeletons, wolves, and other baddies come out, and you also have to worry about things like hunger and deal with extreme heat.

Related A fortnight in Fortnite court

So far, so Minecraft. The big appeal here, though, is not only the Lego aspect but also that it’s available freely within an already very popular game. In fact, Lego Fortnite is just the first of a trio of games coming out inside of Fortnite this week; it’ll be followed by Rocket Racing on December 8th (from the creators of Rocket League) and Fortnite Festival on December 9th (from the studio behind Rock Band and Guitar Hero). The idea is that Fortnite will become more than just the game where players fight to the death on a colorful island. It will be a platform full of all kinds of games, sort of like a more tightly controlled version of Roblox.

“We’re trying to demonstrate a different way to think about a gaming ecosystem, that can hold both the smallest of creator games to the biggest of our first-party games, and anything in between,” Saxs Persson, Epic’s executive VP, tells The Verge. (He was also previously the chief creative officer and VP at Minecraft studio Mojang.)

According to Persson, Lego was the right initial game to further several elements of the Fortnite ecosystem. One is the ongoing desire to build a metaverse, or a virtual space with persistent identities. When Lego and Epic first announced their partnership, the stated goal was to “build a space in the metaverse that’s fun, entertaining, and made for kids and families.” Persson says that’s where the minifigs come in. Epic says that, right now, more than 1,200 Fortnite skins have a Lego variant available (with some offering a higher level of detail), so players can take their favorite outfits across these experiences. “The minifigs that we’re showing, and the idea that you can be different people in the metaverse, is really important to us,” Persson says.

Related Tim Sweeney explains how the metaverse might actually work

Another element is age ratings. In the lead-up to the launch of Fortnite: Chapter 5 and Lego Fortnite, Epic began introducing age ratings for all experiences in the game, including those made by users. Lego Fortnite, for instance, is rated “E10+” while battle royale is rated “Teen.” The Lego collaboration “enabled us to further our idea that Fortnite wasn’t just a Teen game,” Persson says. “It’s an all-ages platform where you get to decide the right content for the right person, and parents feel in control of what their kids can play. And they can live natively next to each other without feeling like we’ve lost the narrative that anybody is welcome.”

The process has already run into some hitches, like when Epic blocked some outfits from child-friendly experiences, only to revert the changes. “We have a great community that will let us know within seconds if we get it wrong,” Persson says.

The final piece of the puzzle is the user-made experiences. Starting at GDC this past March, Epic has been making a bigger push to expand the Fortnite Creative ecosystem, with Unreal Engine-powered tools, a revamped creator economy, and a YouTube-style redesign to push player-built games. And according to Persson, part of the goal behind all of these new Epic-developed games inside of Fortnite — Lego included — is that they will also eventually trickle down to creators, thus expanding the game’s overall ecosystem.

In a press release for Lego Fortnite, for instance, Epic says that “the two companies are also using Unreal Engine to build digital twins for thousands of physical Lego elements, and are working to make these available for creators across the Fortnite ecosystem in both UEFN and Fortnite’s Creative tools in 2024.” (Also coming in 2024: “several more Lego themed games inside Fortnite.”)",technology

Our organs were not built to go

into our 70s or 80s.

By the time we're in our 40s to 50s,

we run into problems.

Going from head to toe,

I'd like to talk about how organs and body parts age,

and what we can do about it.

Over the years, our cells, our organs,

suffer from gradual wear and tear.

We age, but we're not defenseless.

Let's start with our brain.

As we age, our brain atrophies.

It's not problematic

unless things pop up that become problematic.

Speech disorders, you've all heard of Alzheimer's.

Many of the causes of these are not particularly clear.

Our brain starts to lose about 5%

of its volume per decade,

probably somewhere in the 30s.

It decreases because of loss of number of cells,

degeneration of the massive tracks and fibers.

Certain things can lead to brain atrophy.

One of them is vascular problems.

As we age, make sure we are on top of

and checking our vascular systems.

Our ears.

You probably think you have two of them.

In actuality, we have six ears, three on one side,

three on the other, outer, middle, and the inner ear.

We age in all of them.

In our outer ear,

our cartilages and our tissues start to droop.

It didn't devolve for hanging Christmas tree ornaments.

By the time you're well into your years,

you'll be able to wipe your chin with it.

The middle ear has tiny little bones.

Whenever you have bones, they come together at joints,

and you know what joints can get,

can you say arthritis?

Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss,

can be due to arthritis between your little ear bones.

We get to our inner ear.

We have specialized hair cells,

and they send signals to our vestibular cochlear nerve.

That's how we hear, that's how we sense balance.

As we age, hearing loss can be due to death

of the hair cells, what we call sensorineural hearing loss.

We start to lose high frequency sounds

probably around 30 plus.

We do retain most of all low frequency sounds.

[ship horn blasts]

What'd you say? I can't hear you.

Eyes.

As we age, we start to get aspects

of what's called presbyopia,

which is aging of aspects of vision.

The eye is largely a fluid sack.

When fluid vehicles are blocked, this is called glaucoma.

The fluids can become stiffer,

what we call a vitreous humor, can start to harden, shift,

pull away, and you start to see floaters.

Oh, I'm seeing one now. There's another one.

They really bother me. Yeah, I'm seeing...

Look. There's, I got floaters.

They're usually harmless little things.

They don't cause any problems,

but if you see them, you should check them out.

Maybe it's a tear in the retina.

The eye is a direct window onto the brain.

Nose.

These are little bones that come off the nose,

they're called turbinates,

lined with specialized sensory epithelium.

As we age, we're losing many of those cells

in our olfactory nerve.

We lose the smallest cells in the covering of the mucosa.

We do produce less mucus. It's there to catch odorants.

Less mucus, less cells, altered smells.

As our smell decreases,

think of what happens when you have a nose cold

and both your nostrils are blocked.

A potato and an apple will taste the same.

What happens if you can't appreciate the flavor of food?

We try to pull more stuff onto it. More salt.

Oh god, you don't want to put more salt on things.

that's throwing off all your vascular systems.

If you don't eat, you start losing weight.

That's a dangerous thing for many of the elderly.

You stop wanting to go out to dinners,

you don't socialize as much.

Removing that can lead to loneliness

and can lead to depression.

By the way, many medications can change your smell.

If you are noticing

that the pizza doesn't taste like the pizza,

don't be passive.

Skin.

Skin is our biggest organ.

We have proteins in the skin that are called collagen

and elastin, giving structure to aspects in our skin.

Elastin gives us the ability to move.

What happens when we age?

These proteins start to decrease.

Skin all over the body starts to sag,

underneath your arms, breast issues,

your scrotum starts to sag.

What is that? What's happening?

Skin starts to sag on features of our face.

We get a downturn. We get the sad face.

This is giving signals to our other primates that say,

Whoa, distance, unhappy, angry, sad, bad.

They are negative clues.

If I knew stuff when I was 25,

I wouldn't have sat there and baked in the sun for hours.

Now we know moisturize use blockers.

Hair.

Starting in the late 30s, we lose our follicles

and hair starts to become thinner.

This bone, the side of my head is called a temporal bone.

Temporal means time.

When you look on the side of your head,

that's where you can first see hair color starts to change.

The gray comes because we lose melanin.

That's a major signal to some 20 year old that I'm old.

You can knock me over

and you can take my piece of dinner to eat.

Male pattern baldness.

As our androgen starts to go down, we're losing the top,

we're gaining it elsewhere.

On our ears and our beard and our nose hairs,

some of us start looking like Chia Pets.

It's called the Androgen Paradox.

It's a multi-billion dollar business

to figure out how to save the follicle.

It's not the easiest thing to do.

This is really a natural part of life.

You don't have to have the same hair you had

when you were 18.

But be careful

about lots of potentially dangerous chemicals.

Teeth.

So it's in our oral cavity, our tongue,

and also lots of glands.

These glands are producing things that kill bad bacteria.

As we age, submandibular, sublingual glands,

parotid glands start to decrease their secretions.

When bacteria is allowed to spread,

it starts to affect the gums.

They start to recede. We lose the enamel of teeth.

What happens when teeth are removed? The bone disappears.

If you have problems with your upper dentition,

you can get a sinus infection.

Don't disregard your teeth.

Next, the larynx.

The joints of the larynx can age.

The muscles become thinner.

The vocal folds start to shrink,

and the mucus coverings start to desiccate.

We can have arthritis in some of them.

Vocal folds when they're closed together,

they create an ability to stabilize our diaphragm.

When you're constipated,

what you do is close your vocal folds.

They enable you to use the muscles of your abdominal wall

to help nature do its duty.

If these age and the muscles weaken,

we get problems lifting heavy objects,

and we start to have problems with formation and voice.

This is known as presbyphonia.

You can hear somebody

and you can gauge whether they're elderly

just by the sounds coming from their voice.

Heart.

As we get into our 50s and our 60s, the heart muscles,

what we call our myocardium, start to lose oxygen.

It's usually because of problems with the arteries.

We get a hardening of the arteries. They become narrowed.

As they narrow, we have less oxygen going to the heart.

We have a feature in our body

that's called collateral blood flow,

where a structure or an organ gets blood

from various sources.

This is to make sure that the structure

is getting sufficiently nourished.

Our heart does not have a lot of collateral flow.

If we have the death of tissue of the heart,

the overlap of blood supply to the heart

is usually not sufficient to help that heart muscle.

Why not? How come evolution glitched?

Our species, homo sapiens

came about quarter of million years ago.

Life expectancy for our earliest ancestors,

even of our species, 40 plus years would've been maxing out.

Our heart seems to run into problems in the 50s and 60s.

As anybody who's built a house can tell you,

you don't put in extra plumbing if you don't need it.

Uterus.

a female has to carry with her uterus, ovaries,

connecting uterine tubes.

When females age past childbearing years,

hormones are going to change.

Estrogen is going to shift.

The cells are continuing to grow in abnormal ways.

The ovaries become dangerous.

It can't assess ovarian cancers that easily.

Prostate.

The prostate is extremely important early on

in giving help and fluid to sperm.

As you get older now, it blossoms, and as it grows,

the urethra that goes through it becomes blocked.

This starts to happen well into the 30s, into the 40s.

Those of us that are older, we know what it is

to get up three, four times a night to pee.

That's because this prostate is not allowing urine

to have a healthy flow.

This is normal aging.

Prostate exams, I can tell you, are not the most fun to do.

Doc is trying to feel hardness,

which is an indication of cancer.

Joints.

These are beautiful structures.

Here's a patella. Here's a femur.

Here's a tibia. Here's a fibula.

Along these areas are magnificent structures

called articular cartilage.

When we lose it, we can't replace it.

Joint deterioration can begin in your 30 and 40.

If you have abused your joints, stuff will start earlier.

Running is a very, very important part of our evolution.

To get away from some lion that wanted us for Sunday brunch

on the savannas of East Africa.

This didn't evolve for playing football.

It didn't evolve for pounding on concrete.

When we've lost our little discs inside

that are called menisci, we develop all sorts

of inflammation of joints.

That's called arthritis.

Wanna run, find a nice patch of grass.

Try swimming. Get off the concrete.

Don't send me hate letters.

Foot.

Arguably the most important,

least appreciated part of the human body.

When you age, we start to have the issues with vasculature.

The foot and hands are the most distal parts of our body.

Proper circulation is essential.

When I go visit my physician,

he revealed my feet to see if they were warm,

to see if there was good circulation.

Blood flow is a key to so much.

When we start to get reduced blood flow,

we start to get losses of sensation in the skin.

If that occurs, you can fall.

You often hear about people breaking their hip

because they lose sensation often on the bottom of the foot.

By the way, for some of you that have worn high heeled shoes

for years, are you crazy?

Because the end product is gonna be pinched toes,

decreased blood supply, damaged nerves.

Remember your feet.

These are key puppies if we are to remain healthy and alive.

Things change. We have to deal with that.

I still have problems realizing the Dodgers left Brooklyn.

They're not coming back.

I'm old. I'm expensive.

But why do the species keep us around?

It's called wisdom.

And I'll trade in my knee

for the hug of one of my granddaughters any day.

"Today, I’m talking with Avishai Abrahami, the CEO of Wix. You might know Wix as a website builder. It’s a competitor to WordPress and Squarespace. Tons of sites across the web run on Wix. But the web is changing rapidly, and Wix’s business today is less about web publishing and more about providing software to help business owners run their entire companies. It’s fascinating, and Avishai has built a fascinating structure inside of Wix to make all of that happen.

Wix is also an Israeli company. Avishai joined from the company’s headquarters in Tel Aviv. And I’ll just tell you right up front that we talked about the Israel-Hamas war and its impact on the company and that this conversation was not always comfortable. But more on that in a moment.

The main theme of our conversation was, of course, the future of the web, especially a web that seems destined to be overrun by cheap AI-generated SEO spam. I’ve been asking a lot of people why anyone would really want to build a website in 2023. So many small businesses and creators are turning to platforms like TikTok or Instagram, never giving the web a second thought.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

Wix is right in the middle of this. The company has invested so heavily in AI that you can now build entire websites by prompting a chatbot on the Wix platform. So I really wanted to ask Avishai how he’s thinking about all that AI content on the web and if it’s really helping his customers in the long run if the web becomes synonymous with AI-generated garbage.

Like I said, you’ll hear us talk about Wix’s role in the moderation stack because the company sits in a really unique place. On the one end, you have infrastructure providers like Cloudflare, which really don’t want to do any moderation and probably shouldn’t. On the other end, social networks like Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) do a lot of moderation and probably should. Wix sits right in the middle alongside other e-commerce and tech platforms like Etsy and Shopify.

I asked Avishai about Etsy’s recent decision to ban merchandise with the phrase “from the river to the sea” printed on it and asked whether Wix would ban the phrase from websites on its platform. It is as complicated a moderation decision as there is. But Avishai is the first person we’ve had on Decoder who’s been willing to say outright that content moderation is not hard. To him, there’s a clear line, and you’ll hear him explain why Wix doesn’t seem to dwell too much on the murkier gray areas of content moderation that major social platforms seem to live in.

I also asked Avishai how involved the Israeli government has been in Wix’s operations during the war and whether recent news headlines about the company firing employees for incendiary rhetoric concerning the conflict might change its approach to moderation overall.

One more note before we start. This interview was recorded right before the chaos at OpenAI that led to Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring in under a single week. You’ll hear Avishai and me discuss OpenAI and ChatGPT in this conversation. Wix is an OpenAI customer and has been relying on that technology for quite some time, so just keep in mind that we had no idea what was about to happen when we had this conversation.

Okay, Avishai Abrahami, CEO of Wix. Here we go.

This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Avishai Abrahami, you’re the co-founder and CEO of Wix. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you, thank you. My pleasure to be here.

You are talking to us from your offices in Tel Aviv. Thank you for making the time. I understand it’s a very difficult time in Israel, but there’s a lot to talk about. Let’s start at the start. What is Wix?

We’ve created Wix to enable everybody to create web content, websites, easily. As time evolves, the company also evolves. We started by making simple pages in the beginning — in Flash, as funny as it is now. We’ve evolved now to enable you to actually create all of your business on Wix. We’ll do anything, from different commerce transactions, to scheduling, to restaurant orders, all the way to managing your backend and [making sure] that you have your customer list, ability to market to your customers. So the full stack runs your small or larger business on the internet, while, at the same time, if you just want to create two pages about something, you can still go to Wix and do it easily.

In many ways, we try to make it a product that, we always say, it’s not simple. If you know how to use PowerPoint or Excel, you should know how to use Wix. And if you think about Excel and PowerPoint, they’re not necessarily very easy. They require some knowledge of computers, some skill in computers, but if you have that, then you should be able to create amazing things on Wix. That was the goal.

Excel and PowerPoint are actually really great comparisons. Almost anybody can do the very basic thing in those applications. And then, I’m pretty sure at this point you can run Doom in Excel, right? It’s a programming language unto itself inside of there. That’s real, by the way. I’m pretty sure you can.

Is that how you think about the spread of Wix? All the way at the end, you should be able to create other applications inside of it?

Yeah. Today, Wix actually includes a very simple way to write JavaScript, so anything you can run on the web, you can actually build on top of Wix today, and we’ll do the back-end and front-end hosting for you automatically, so you don’t even have to know what it means. In many ways, yes, if you can create Doom on the web, you should be able to create it on Wix, in Wix, today.

You’re describing the customer set here. It’s people who want to put up two pages and just say, “Here’s my CV” or whatever, all the way to, “You run a restaurant, Wix is the application layer for your restaurant. You’re doing your booking, and you’re building on that.” Is that a set of templates for people? Is that, you’ve got a bunch of business types that you know you’re going to service, and you have people building that stuff? Or is it [that] the restaurant owner has to build it themselves?

We have, of course, templates, but that’s mostly for the visual side. We also have an application for restaurants that we built that enables you to do a lot of the things you need in a restaurant. We have another one that, if you have a hair salon or a gym or an e-commerce or physical store, we built those applications. You can install them on top of Wix, and then it allows you to manage your business and get orders, get reservations, manage events. All of this [is] a separate application that you install on top of the Wix platform.

And this all happens on the web, right? The thing I’m pushing at is, there’s this sort of front-end web presence that a business needs or someone needs. I just need to show you some information. I need to show you my menu, what times we’re open. And then, there’s, “Oh, I need to run my business using software. I need to manage the schedule of events. I need to book the classes and see who’s coming. I need to do some outbound marketing on Facebook,” or whatever it is. Are you all the way through that? If I’m running a small gym and I’m like, “I need some software to run my gym,” you want people to think of Wix?

Yes. In fact, if you have a gym, we can actually give you everything you need on the web but also an application, a native iPhone or an Android application for tablet or for phone, in which you can manage the memberships; you can see who signs in or signs out. You can give an application to your members, if you want, so they can do reservations from your application now, essentially. We give you the full stack to manage your business, the full software stack, and it all connects and works well together. This is another important part of it. It’s not a bunch of different software vendors that you have to integrate.

I think of Wix as a website builder, but you’re saying this is much more a small business software solutions provider, right? You don’t have to worry about running software, making an iOS app. You just skin some templates, and we’ll deploy code on all these platforms for you.

Yeah. I think that, beyond Intuit, we are number two in the amount of small businesses running on our platform.

How many customers do you have? Is it mostly small businesses?

Most of our customers are small businesses. We have enterprise customers as well, and there are people that do it privately, so personal sites. But the vast majority, of course, are small and tiny businesses.

Is that a growth market? Do you see more and more small businesses saying, “Okay, we’re going to start. It’s a dry cleaner operation, I need some software, just pull it off the shelf and go”? Or are you having to go do outbound marketing?

We actually do a lot of marketing because I think the brand is now getting so strong that our marketing just needs to support it, but we have about 2 million signups every month.

And how many people work at Wix?

5,000 and something.

And most of them are in Israel, or are you around the world?

No, around the world. We have about half in Israel, but we have a lot of people in the United States, in Europe, and in many different places.

Let me ask some Decoder questions here. You have been CEO of Wix since you founded it 17 years ago. Obviously, you’ve grown to the size of all your employees around the world. You did just do some layoffs. How is Wix structured now, and how does that work?

We did very little layoffs. What we did is that, during covid, the demand we got to our services was very big, so we needed to increase the support. As we went from covid and a peak in demand to a global economy slowdown, we found that we needed less people in the support department. When people left, we didn’t rehire. We did a bit of layoffs.

How is the company structured now? You just cut there, but is the structure the same?

Yeah. The structure of the company is very similar to what it’s always been. And the company is built around the fact that I, as a CEO, always believe that my number one job is to hire very smart people and then to build startups where you have somebody who owns a part in Wix and manage that as if it was a startup.

This is how Wix is built. For example, we have the editor, which is what essentially you build websites with. But then, you have an application, for example, [for] managing events. That will be its own startup, essentially, meaning we try to make it as independent as possible and to have one guy that, of course, is making the decision. And our job, as management, is to make all of those heads of those startups within Wix work well together.

So you have multiple divisions. There’s a restaurant business division. There’s a, I don’t know, a gym business division, a dry cleaner division.

Exactly.

I’m assuming you have not just local, small town… I’m just thinking of businesses on my street. But you have people in charge of those. Do they share code? How does that work?

Yes. Actually, one of the things we did early on, we started by saying, “Okay, just code any way you want.” And of course, that works very well in phase one but works very badly in phase two and phase three.

Today, we have a lot of infrastructure that is unified. For example, we have a project called Nile, which is server architecture which automates 95 percent of what you need to do when you build a server for a web application. Everybody’s sharing that. And we migrated all the old projects on top of that.

Then, we have a lot also on the front end. All of the user interface libraries are unified, so we have a common language, a common code, and if we fix a bug in one place, everybody enjoys that. And then, we have rules, like, if you want to add a component to the visual thing, you have two choices. Either you use what we have already, or you build it and donate it so everybody can use it. So it’s always growing, but it’s always unified. We do a lot in order to make sure that we work on the same code base as much as possible without slowing down everybody else.

This is the central tension of every platform that has multiple divisions and multiple different customer sets: sometimes your customers probably don’t have the same needs or even have opposing needs. How do you manage that conflict?

As you said, it’s always the trickier and harder part when you have multiple divisions or multiple units working and each one of them wants to do their own thing. But if each one of them does the same thing, it’s going to be horrifying.

I’ll give you an example. If you look at how to build a web service, there are tons of blogs. There are millions of resources on the internet, and they’re fantastic when you need to build one. But when you have 1,000 web services running, now it’s a very different problem. It’s not the same problem. And if you look at the amount of information you have now to do and maintain 1,000, it’s actually almost nonexistent.

But every company that is growing to a certain size is starting to accumulate all of those very quickly, and you’re going to end up having 100, and then 1,000, then 2,000. And if you don’t start tackling it from a very early point, you find that you have a lot of migration to do, which is always very hard. Instead of this agility that you get because everybody did what they wanted at the beginning, it’s actually becoming a terrible thing for agility when you have 20 or 30 services, and then, when you have 1,000, nothing can really happen.

This is one of the most important things we tackled, and it requires a lot of discipline. And now, none of the developers like the concept of discipline, meaning, “This is how you do it.”

Especially on the web.

Well, anywhere. The developers, they just read a very fantastic post by somebody on how to do something in a much nicer or interesting way, and then they want to try it. They want to play with it. They want to build something with it. And suddenly, it’s like, “Oh, no, this is how we do it. You have to do it like that.” Or you have to upgrade the old system for everybody, which is a very pricey project.

But after a while, what happened is that, if I look at Nile, which is one example — and we have a few of those — in the beginning, nobody wanted to use it. And we actually had probably more people threaten to resign from Wix if we continued to work on that or do that than any other thing we ever did in the history of the company. But as that survey infrastructure became more and more mature, now everybody just wants to use that.

There is a point where the value of the platform is getting to this level that it becomes, “Oh, I just want to do that.” And then, people start to, at the same level of energy that they used to say, “I will never use it,” now, they say, “Well, yes, I absolutely want to use it.”

And then, it’s another thing happened. I want to go back and say, “Well, I don’t just want to work on this business logic in those applications. I actually want to go work on that infrastructure.” And we have a bunch of projects like that, and we’re seeing it pretty much continuously in all of them. You just have to be very patient and make sure that your infrastructure is very developer-friendly. And developer-friendly means a lot of things, but once you get that right, I think it’s very, very important.

So you’ve got heads of business who are working in the business logic for different categories. You’ve got infrastructure. You said it’s about 5,000 people. How is that split? How big is each little division?

It depends. I think the smallest one we have is about 15.

And is that engineering, design, product management? Is that a standard little product team, or how does that work?

Yeah, exactly like that. You touched it exactly. And the concept is that they need to prove what they’re doing is actually viable. At some point, they come back and say, “Okay, look at the numbers. Obviously, there’s an opportunity here. We’re not thinking there’s an opportunity. We can prove there is an opportunity.” And from that point, we’ll start to increase it in order to maximize that opportunity. And the largest one would be, I don’t know, 190 people.

Which one’s that? What is the smallest one? What is the biggest?

Well, the smallest one is in regards to education things on the web, how to do online classes. There are a lot of things that are done there. I think that’s the smallest one. And the largest one, I believe, is the editor team.

That’s the new editor, the Editor X?

No. All of the editor group is managed as one, and then it’s broken into two small statuses between and below that.

Okay. And that’s the thing you actually use to make a Wix website?

Yes.

That team is—

The new one is called Studio, by the way, Wix Studio.

Okay, here’s the classic Decoder question. You’ve now been the CEO for 17 years, more than 17 years. How do you make decisions?

It’s one of those things. A lot of the time, I talk to entrepreneurs, and most of the time, younger entrepreneurs, they talk to me about the fact that they make a lot of decisions every day. And I usually say, “Well, I make probably four every quarter.”

And I think the number one thing is to understand that it’s much better to make four every quarter than a dozen every day because I mostly try to delegate and to make sure that we know: What are the rules? How do we measure success? How do we enable other people to make smart decisions? And they’ll come and tell me what they want to do, but essentially, it’ll be mostly their decisions and not mine. It’ll be my responsibility but their decisions.

We have a full method of how to make decisions. Everything is measured. This is number one. We are fanatic about it. We measure everything. If you did something that cannot be measured, then nothing happened. That’s our philosophy. In fact, a lot of the time, don’t tell us about it. Don’t come and show off a project that cannot be measured. You can come, by the way, and show us a project that you measured and had a negative effect, and you’re going to get the same amount of cheers as you would for a project that had positive effects because we want to encourage that aggressiveness in testing and going to new places.

A lot of data we measure — from conversion, to what people are saying, to customer feedback, our customer support feedback. And from that, we’re trying to create this big table of the things we think we should be doing and try to assess their value. And from this, we actually build the roadmaps. This is one layer. The other layer is where we want to get to strategically. Where we want to get to strategically is another important part. And then we make sure that it’s written, it’s well understood. And then we broadcast it to everybody in the company.

The tension I’ve always found there is that data can only tell you about the past. And big strategic thinking, big strategic bets — like your bet on AI, for example — there’s no data that tells you that’s going to happen. You just have to know. How do you manage that tension?

This is part of what we call strategic. Because you can do those gradual changes, and the internet is a very good place for winning those small bets, but those small bets only take you that far. At some point, you need to change the rules of the game in order to go to the next jump so you can iterate again.

I think that there is no single way to anticipate what kind of a change will happen. Sometimes, there is some kind of way to assess things because you understand your customers very well. I can tell you that if I build something in AI that will help my customer write blogs, I will definitely utilize more blogs, because I know the pain is there, because I can assess the pain that the customer has. But it’s not always true. And I believe that that’s fine. That’s why I said it’s okay to do things that won’t make a big change. The only thing that is important about that is to recognize the fact that this might happen and to encourage that because you want to take big bets. But the number one metric that we have to predict the future is understanding what customers are saying.

If you’re working at Wix and you work in product, we actually measure how many conversations you have with customers. And we used to actually really have a number for that so we know exactly how many you had in order to encourage you to always do that. Because the most important work of a product guy is to understand the pain of their customers.

My philosophy, when it comes to building product — I think it’s a bit different than most — but I’ll say it: it’s that everybody always used to tell me that the most important thing is to know, “Who is the customer?” We spoke about Excel. Who is the customer for Excel? Who is the customer for an iPhone? Who is the customer for Chrome? Well, everybody, right? That’s not a really good answer.

But let me ask you, what are they trying to do? What is the guy using Word trying to do? What is the guy using Chrome trying to do? Suddenly, it’s very easy to answer. I believe that to predict good product is to understand, “What is the customer trying to do?”— not who he is. And then, when you understand what they’re trying to do, to build something that makes it easy for him to do it or fun for him to do it. And if you got that right, you can pretty much predict the future.

I want to talk about that because you’re making a big bet on AI across the company. I am obsessed with what AI will do to the web. This is why we started talking, because you’ve made this big bet, and I think everyone knows that I’m obsessed with the future of the web right now. That’s something you had to impose, right? You had to go to all these product teams and say, “Alright. We’re doing AI now. You’re not all in your little silos.” How did you execute a decision like that?

Actually, that’s an interesting story. My background is [as] a developer, as you can probably guess from all the technical details. We started to work on AI-related projects in 2014, and then, in 2016, we released ADI, which is AI that was creating websites. You told it a little bit, and it created everything for you. It’s very basic AI — not transformers and not attention-based transformers, of course, that was actually invented in 2017 by the algorithm, but it created decent websites in seconds.

But when I tried to get the company, all the team, to use an AI-based project, it was very hard. And I think, last year or a year ago, it became very easy. Everybody wanted something to do with AI. Before, it was an uphill battle, I think, in many ways. I think ADI was the first mass-market product, at least, that actually allowed people to create something with AI. I’m not sure about it. I think it was because millions of people used it. And we learned a lot from that interaction. We learned a lot, so I’m with you. I think that it’s going to be a huge change — not just in the web, in everything we do.

Are you running on OpenAI’s models? Do you have your own LLMs? How does that work?

We don’t have our own LLM. I think that LLM, I hope Sam Altman won’t get mad at me for saying that, but I think LLM is a commodity, and we don’t have any advantage in making one of our own. Of course, there are gaps. We are using OpenAI, which I think are the best currently, [the] best in class at this stage, and we’re very happy with the partnership with them. But I think, long term, the difference between the quality of the text that you get from one to the other will continue to shrink.

How do you measure quality of text? I feel like you can measure quality of code, which, when I talk to people, everyone is very excited about the programming aspect of LLMs. My view about the text aspect is that it’s a C+, and that’s where it tops out. How do you measure quality of text versus quality of code?

We have a way to look at it, right? We see how much of our customers are actually happy about it. And when we’re talking about our numbers, it’s a pretty decent way to measure it. But to be fair, we never tried to use Bard or any of the other ones. We’ve used OpenAI for, I think, almost a year, more than a year now.

OpenAI is a cost, right?

Yeah.

You’re obviously paying them. You’re reselling whatever they’re giving you to your customers. You’re obviously making a margin.

We’re actually sponsoring it, at this stage, for our customers, because the value in the conversion is such that it’s worth our time.

Okay. But at some point, you’re going to charge for it, right? You’re going to put a margin on top of that service, or you don’t think so?

I don’t think so. Maybe to some things, but essentially, if you come to Wix today, you can have Wix’s OpenAI fill the template with the content that is relevant to you and create a lot of different things with the content that is relevant to you, all using OpenAI. And the value in the conversion from free to paying that we get is higher than what we pay to OpenAI, so I prefer, actually, to keep it free.

And you think that cost is going to come down — the OpenAI cost is going to come down? Or you’ll be able to go to the market and say, “Okay, this is a commodity now. Who’s the cheapest?” and the quality level will be the same.

Yeah. Well, I hope to stay with OpenAI, because I’ve been their partner for a long time, but I do believe that the cost will go down. What do you think about it? Let me reverse the question for a minute.

I think the web is in an enormous amount of danger from tools like this, and we haven’t quite reckoned with what happens when we take a statistical averaging of the web that existed until today and publish millions of more websites with it. And there’s a feedback loop in there where I don’t know where the new ideas come from. And I don’t know why anybody with new ideas would look at that state of things and choose the web over TikTok or over YouTube.

There’s something there that I think is really interesting and really fascinating, and potentially really dangerous, which is probably why I think it’s really interesting, but I haven’t quite sorted it out in my mind. That’s why I want to talk to so many CEOs of companies that make the web, because it feels like there needs to be some limiting principle on how much AI text we publish because, otherwise, we’re going to choke out all the people.

But you have an interesting assumption here.

Yeah.

I agree with you on the averaging thing, and I agree with you on the fact that it’s only recycled information. LLMs are not meant to invent information, but you assume that it’s not going to happen on TikTok and Instagram. Well, I believe that it’s a matter of a year or a year and a half, and we’re going to see it happening on Instagram and TikTok. Most of what you’ll see on TikTok can be generated with the equivalent of LLM. And that will, again, recycle information.

Look, I don’t disagree with you there, and YouTube has a new policy about deepfakes and taking them down, and I think every platform is going to have to come up with some policy about AI-generated content or synthetic content. I think that’s a real tension for every platform.

I’m saying, specifically for the web, which is more or less a text-based platform, there’s no way to detect it reliably. And then the recommendation engine for the web is Google, which is, I think, losing the war against SEO spam, broadly. There’s just a feedback loop on this platform that I think is different than the feedback loop on Instagram or TikTok.

I’ll ask you the question in a much more direct way. If you were a younger person today, and you have a great idea or you want to communicate or you want to build an audience, why on earth would you start a website instead of a TikTok channel?

I think you should do both, but essentially, and I see examples every day, the combination is way more powerful than just one. And a lot of people still go to Google and do a search. And TikTok, when you do a search, you’re not necessarily going to get what you expect. On the web, you still get what you expect.

I think the question of why there is an SEO battle is a really interesting one because I think Google is way smarter than we give them credit for. I don’t believe that you can fool Google by changing your alt text to something. And for some reason, a lot of the time, it does work. And obviously, there are super smart engineers at Google, so I would think that a lot of it is on purpose.

I also probably have the luxury place of being in the spot where I see more websites than anybody else on the planet, and I know the results on Google, so I can see a lot of the things behind the algorithm. If Google will decide one day to remove fake content, there’ll be no fair content in Google.

Yeah.

I really believe so. Maybe I’m naive when I give them too much credit, but I think they’re really smart engineers. But for your question, let’s use a business, okay? Let’s say, you said a gym before. If you’re a gym, how do people go to check what’s happening in a gym? You’re not going to go to TikTok for that, right?

But you’re increasingly going to go to Instagram for that. I know dozens of restaurants in New York City that have horrible websites, and their answer is, “Go to facebook.com/myrestaurant,” or, “Go to instagram.com/myrestaurant. Our menus are posted on Instagram daily.”

It’s true. By the way, for restaurants, it might be more true, but for a gym when you have this specific activity as an event, a thing you need to register for, it’s not something you’re going to do on Instagram. And by the way, for a well-managed restaurant, I would argue that a lot of the things you want to do, you need to be able to communicate with your customers more directly than hope that somehow the Instagram algorithm will push it to your customers. And I think, for a majority of businesses, that’s the case.

If you want an issue, by the way, a new makeup company for 12-year-old girls, you don’t need a website. You definitely need to be on TikTok and Instagram. But for a lot of the others, if you are a doctor, if you are a gym, if you are a lot of e-commerce businesses, I think you still find that your communication with the customer essentially has to be something that you control.

You’re saying something here that I think is really important: direct connection to customers. I run a publisher. My whole thing is, we need to have a direct relationship with our audience. People need to know us. They need to know The Verge. They need to trust us. That is us doing the work. If I start publishing lots of AI-generated articles, that trust is going to go down. I think people will sniff it out instantly.

If you’re a doctor and you sign up for Wix, and you let the AI fill out all the content on your website, you’re just trying to convert them into showing up at your office so that you might personally build a connection with your patients. But that part where you’re just doing content marketing, that’s the part that seems dangerous to me. It’s all going to be kind of the same. It’s all going to read kind of the same.

Yeah, it’s true.

It might be in the same templates, even. That’s the thing I’m worried about, the differentiation there. Even the text starts to collapse to the same thing.

I agree, but this is assuming they all just go in and click a button. Let me tell you the number one lesson we learned from ADI, which is you could go in and say, “I’m a hairdresser from New Jersey,” or, “I’m a doctor from Montana,” and it will be a fantastic website. And then people didn’t want that. What they wanted is to tell their story. The most important part of ADI was not just the ability to build and immediately start with a template. It was actually going in and editing that to your picture, to your images, to your story, and helping our customer achieve that. Once we got that right, it became a very successful product. The magic of the AI was really inspiring to see, but it didn’t let people take their story and put it on the web, and I think that was a huge difference.

From that, what I learned is that, it’s actually proof to your point, which is to make even our customers, not their customers, happy, they need to be able to tell their story, their personal story. I can generate on Midjourney amazing pictures of dishes in a restaurant, fantastic-looking dishes in an amazing restaurant, but if it’s not the real restaurant, it doesn’t really help. So they want to take their images, they want to take that to tell the story of the chef, to tell the story of why they do it. And I think a lot of that is really important and needs to be carried into the story. The good thing is that it’s very easy to see that the text is written by AI.

I hope so. I’m not sure everyone can see it. I can see it. I’m not sure everyone can see it.

Well, for machines. For machines, it’s very easy—

You think so? Actually, I’m not sure about that, either. OpenAI had a tool, and they had to pull it down because it was inaccurate.

Yeah, but because it’s trying to predict 100 percent, and to predict 100 percent is very hard, but to see that almost always the next word is the most likely word to be, or one of the 20 most likely words to be, or one of the 1,000 more likely words to be. So I would imagine that, when Google decides to know that, they’ll know it.

Do you sell your customers on, “You will rank highly in Google if you use Wix”? Is that a part of your marketing? Is that a part of your value proposition?

We don’t sell it like that because you can never guarantee that. And if you want to do a, “I’m a restaurant in New York,” and to tell you that you’re going to be number one ranking, it’s a lie. You might, but it’s not honest.

I can say without a doubt that Wix, probably today, is the best platform to be ranked by Google. When I actually asked Google about it, I got a very interesting explanation, which is, you can hardly do any fake SEO things on Wix. The websites are very honest. The SEO engine looks at them the way the website is, while, if you look at other platforms, especially the open-source ones, it’s very easy to do a lot of fake stuff.

Now, one of the parameters that the bot has, the SEO AI, because it’s all AI today, is, “What is the platform?” If you look at all the open-source ones, a lot of them look better than they really are. They have this thing that they look better, but Google and Wix sites look exactly like they should be. What happened is that Bard learns it because they keep testing how people interact with the content, with the website. They actually get this penalty, on a relative basis, to a Wix website. So the results… and it’s not just Wix, I’m pretty sure that Squarespace will have the same phenomenon. If you build a site with a platform that is very clean, you actually get a positive, on a relative basis, you get a positive ranking boost.

How much time do you spend thinking about SEO?

Well, I used to do it a lot because I really wanted to understand it, but now it’s a time when I understand the basics of it and the principles of it, so we have a very smart team that is doing that.

How big is that team? How big is the Wix SEO team?

I think, overall, it’s about almost 50. A lot of them, their effort is mostly about our customers’ websites, not our website. We use Wix to build Wix. When we need something in SEO, everybody gets it. All of our customers get it.

And how would you characterize your relationship with Google?

Mostly friendly. We are a big customer. We are the biggest reseller, as far as I know, of Google, of Gmail, so I think pretty friendly, as much as you can be friendly with Google.

Yeah, I’m just asking because, again, Google Search is the biggest referral engine for every website, essentially. As they do more and more of the Search Generative Experience, they start answering the queries with AI, that referral traffic starts to drop, that ranking question gets a little more contentious. I’m wondering if you’ve seen any change or you’ve detected a change from your customers.

Not yet, but I think that it will actually be a beneficial thing, because if you look at websites that compete on exactly the same thing, yeah, it’s not so good to be... for those websites. But if you look at most of our customers, which have real substantial businesses, then Google being able to find them and get some of the content easily to the search side and then allow you to go and do the reservation and order, either on the website or on Google, it’s actually going to be beneficial for our customers, so I think overall, it’s a good thing.

I have been talking to other CEOs of web companies. I had Squarespace CEO Anthony Casalena on the show. I had WordPress’ Matt Mullenweg. I think, when you say the open-source ones, you’re talking about WordPress.

There are a few open-source platforms. I’m not going to be picking which one.

Fair enough.

But there are those that have a huge amount of SEO plug-ins. We try to make your site look better than it is. And the result is that all of the other ones who are using the same platform will be affected by that. Every time you do that, you’re affecting everybody and taking everybody a bit down. And then Squarespace doesn’t do it, right? So their website, when the AI looks at them, it knows that what it sees, it is what it is. It’s a huge difference.

Anthony Casalena, the CEO of Squarespace, I asked him the same question: why would anybody start a website instead of a TikTok channel if you’re young? And he said, “Well, look, everyone starts a TikTok channel or an Instagram channel. And then the reason you need a website is because you’re doing e-commerce and you don’t want to pay a 30 percent fee to Instagram or Apple or whoever it is. You want to kick people out to the web and do the transaction there so you can take 100 percent of the revenue.”

Look, I think that’s honest. I think that’s direct. I think that is the right answer. I think it makes economic sense. It felt, to me, very cynical. The only thing we need the web for is lower transaction rates.

We don’t see it like that. We don’t see it in our customers. And if you look at a lot of them, it’s more about the fact that they need a relationship. And I think that is essential. I think, still, most people, if they want to find something, they still go to Google. They don’t go to Instagram and start doing searches for local things.

That’s changing, though, right? The data shows that younger people are starting to use TikTok for search instead of Google.

Yeah, but for what? For restaurants.

It’s the same as you. What is the customer trying to do? They’re trying to find things.

Yeah, but you’re not looking for your gym, probably, on TikTok. Maybe you do. I don’t know, but we don’t see a decline in traffic. I might be wrong, but I think I have the most broad view on the planet except Google because we have more websites than anybody else that we actually manage. And I think we’re about twice the size of Squarespace in terms of sites.

Do you have a hedge against a big change to Google Search? Is there something in the back of your mind that you’re paranoid about?

I’m not, actually. I’m not so concerned. I never understand the concern here so much.

Yeah.

If you can explain to me the concern better, maybe I’ll know what—

I think the concern, generally, from publishers I’ve talked to, from website owners that I know, is that Google’s search referrals are the last source of big referral traffic on the web. Facebook doesn’t send you any traffic anymore. TikTok never did. Twitter never really did actually. You have one thing left, and as that declines, because Google is going to do more and more AI-written summaries of search results, then you will have to find another business, that you’ll have to find another source of traffic or pivot to another revenue platform.

And that affects up and downstream. It has effects on the publishers themselves. It has effects on the business themselves. And it would have an effect on you because, if your customers’ traffic starts to decline, your revenues would start to decline.

Of course. But I think a lot of it is mostly for publishers. And I think, publishers, yeah, they do have an issue, and we know that. Why? Because they used to be able to publish their articles on Facebook and then get people to come to their website. And that stopped because Facebook stopped it. It never did it, as you mentioned. But I think small businesses are in a bit of a different place. Maybe I’m wrong, but we don’t see a difference in the amount of traffic that is coming. In fact, over time, we see an increase.

And I think that AI that is able to, if Google Bard becomes a tool on the internet where you’re able to do a lot of the transaction from Bard itself, it’s a good thing for small businesses because you’re still going to need your business stack.

You’re still going to need to do the transaction, the registration to events. You still need to be able to say, “Oh, we have a discount.” You still need to be able to do, “Okay, you can buy this and get that.” You still need to manage the whole offering, your story, the story that Bard tells. Unless Bard is going to be a way for you to start composing the content as well, you’d still need to be able to tell your story, your images, your content, your product, your sales, your special offers. And if Bard is able to communicate with that and increase conversion for small businesses, I think that’s fantastic. And by the way, it’s fantastic for us as well.

Right, because you would be the provider of all that business.

I think that, hopefully, we’re going to see more of that and not less of that. If I were The New York Times, I would have a lot of concerns, but that’s a different story.

Yeah. They’re pretty bad over there, from what I gather. You’ll notice, by the way, that almost every demo Google does on Bard ends in a transaction. They’re very focused on it.

No, I know. But I think that’s great. I really believe that this can help a lot of our customers. I’m not sure, by the way, what’s going to be the business model. That’s another interesting thing.

I think they’re going to take a cut of all those transactions. I think this is the thing people worry about, right? They’re going to shift the business model. Google’s not bad at making money.

Yeah, but they usually make money out of two things: advertisements on YouTube and advertisements on the web. And the cost of most advertising is higher than the value of the transaction, meaning that you always, in a lot of businesses, you actually make money on the second transaction. You’re trying to capture the customer, but the cost of the ad is much higher than the value of the first transaction, so taking 30 percent of that would mean that they cut their revenues by about 80 percent. I’m not sure I understand how that would work, but they’re smart guys. As I said, they have really smart people there.

They have a long road ahead of them. I want to end here by talking about the bigger picture.

Of course.

Wix is an Israeli company, you’re an Israeli CEO, there’s a war going on. You performed your compulsory military service in a very famous intelligence unit called Unit 8200. What is it like for you right now running your company in Israel?

Also, we had covid, which here, it was a big thing. Not in Israel specifically, but for Wix, because we had all those people that joined Wix and really needed us in many ways. We had our own small war of assisting millions and millions of small businesses survive covid.

Then we had about 1,000 employees in Ukraine, so we had the war in Ukraine. And now we have this one here. I got to say, those are a hard couple of years, and I really hope the next year will be very boring. No big wars, no big plagues. Of course, to say that we are more practiced now and how to handle such crises, it’s pretty much a sad thing. I think Wix is a strong company. We have international teams, local teams, and I think we’re in a place that we can navigate that in the best way we can at this stage.

Again, we started talking about this conversation a while ago, and even just in doing the research, there’s some whiplash here. Several months ago, I would’ve asked you about your employees joining a general strike, protesting the changes to the judiciary in Israel. There were ads around that move taken out in all the major newspapers, full-page blackout ads, calling the [Benjamin] Netanyahu government’s moves around the judiciary, and this is a quote, “a black day for democracy.”

Executives from Wix were in Wired magazine saying, “We have to support liberal democracy. We have to fight for what’s right. We have to make Israel a good democracy.” Here we are now, in November, the war is on. And inside of Wix, there have been Slack channels called “supporting Israeli narrative.” That is pretty intense whiplash, right?

I’m not sure I understand—

The company’s relationship to the government, how are you managing that?

Well, I think that, at this stage, what we do is try to focus on helping humanitarian aid as much as we can, locally, here. Something that you don’t know, we actually have people working for Wix in the West Bank. Think about that for a minute. We have people, the same thing as we have in Ukraine. I think our goal, as a company, is to focus on the human side and to do our best to help the humanitarian efforts and supporting food for people that were evacuated from homes and do what we can to do that.

What is your relationship to the government of Israel like? Before, it was fairly opposed, right? Your employees, at least, were saying, “We don’t like these moves that this government is making.” Now, it feels like, nationalistically, it has to be different.

We have employees, I think, from both sides. We have here non-religious Jewish, Orthodox Jewish, Arabs, Muslim Arabs, working at Wix. We have all of the different kind of colors, and I think that’s a good thing. Personally, I’m not a political figure. I don’t know a lot about the reform, the suggested reforms. I think democracy is a value, is a super important one, and we should do everything we can to make sure that democracy is maintained here, and by the way, spread around the world.

Here’s the part that I think is very complicated for any tech CEO in your position. You make a platform that publishes speech. You have content rules. I went and looked at the form for reporting bad Wix websites today. You can report a Wix website for having hate speech on it or harassing people.

Yes, that’s true.

Is there content you would not allow in Wix related to the war?

Yeah, absolutely. Every hate speech.

Hate speech. So if I make a pro-Palestinian website, that’s allowed.

There are many. I’m not trying... By the way, I want to be clear. I think that, if you go to Israel, 90 percent of people are pro-Palestinian, which I don’t think that Hamas is pro-Palestinian. I think there is a big difference. I think [Joe] Biden was the one emphasizing that. And I think our goal, as a publisher platform, is to make sure that hate speech, racism, in every kind of its forms, is not something that is on our platform. And there are other things. By the way, if you upload pedophile content, we’re not just going to remove it, we’re also going to report you to the FBI. And this is, I think, some of our moral obligation, and we need to maintain that.

As an Israeli company, do you feel pressure from the Israeli government to support the Israeli narrative?

No, actually, absolutely not.

Is there a line for you that you can point to that says, “Okay, here’s where pro-Palestinian bleeds into being pro-Hamas, and we won’t allow this?”

I’m not sure I understand the—

If I publish a website and it’s a pro-Palestinian website, you’re saying that’s allowed on Wix. Is there a line in the content of that website where you would say, “Okay, this is no longer allowed, this is pro-Hamas.”

Well, I think it’s quite obvious.

Okay.

By the way, if you go around here and talk to most of the Palestinians, they’re not in support of Hamas.

Sure. But let me give you a very specific example. Yesterday, my friend Casey Newton published on Platformer a story about Etsy. And Etsy has made the decision, a big decision, to no longer allow merchandise that has the words “from the river to the sea” on it. This is obviously a loaded phrase—

… calling to the destruction of Israel, yes.

Would you allow a website with that phrase on it?

No.

Again, Etsy had to take a huge process review to do this because the meaning of that phrase has changed over time. Would you allow websites with that phrase on it?

How has the meaning of that phrase changed over time?

Well, from the ’60s to now, it has changed. It’s being used in a different way now that I think is very loaded. I think, on Etsy, where there’s not a lot of context, it’s just T-shirts. They’re saying, “Look, we can’t offer people the context of history—”

I think you’re making me very uncomfortable now. I would rather not—

Well, I’m just asking. This is the thing you do, right? You have to publish people’s websites. Here is a phrase that some people might want to publish. Would they be allowed to publish that phrase?

I’m not sure how the meaning changed there. It’s the same river. This river has been for very long… How did the meaning change from the ’60s to now?

I don’t think it always implied the destruction of Israel. I think a lot of people—

There is one—

It doesn’t even now when they want to use it. But there is that secondary meaning now, and that is a very important meaning. And some platforms are like, “We don’t even want to be associated—”

It only exists from the river to the sea. There is no other thing.

I understand. So you’re saying that would not be allowed?

Actually, I haven’t checked.

Okay.

I haven’t checked that. I trust my team to do what is right, but I haven’t specifically checked that.

Is there a difference between how you think about the speech that is published on your products and the speech inside the company? There was a report that an employee in Ireland was fired for posting some pretty incendiary things about the war in Israel. They called Israel a terrorist state, and they were fired. Is there a difference there? Would you allow that to be published on Wix, but you don’t allow it inside your own company?

I got to tell you, no, she was not punished because of the contact of the political context. It’s that when you call a terrorist to somebody who’s a colleague of yours while his family has been kidnapped or assassinated, we look at you as a bit of an asshole, and we have a policy that we don’t hire or employ assholes. We were very clear on the behavioral side of that, and employees should have whatever political opinion they want.

Yeah, I’m wondering, right? Because where you sit in the moderation stack is very important. I would not expect a company like Cloudflare to scan all the bits on its network and remove that content. I might expect a platform company like Etsy to remove that content or even a social network like Meta or X or something to say, “Look, we have a policy around this phrase. It’s very loaded. We don’t want it here.” You’re right in the middle, right? You’re in a very blurry place in the middle of those things.

I don’t think so.

I’m just curious where you think—

I actually don’t agree with you.

You don’t think so?

I think that the obligation to remove hate speech is not a blurry place.

Okay.

I think it’s a very clear place. And I think that the difference, most of the time, is very obvious. And by the way, we would remove a lot of things that… if we had a KKK website. It’s a real story: that it is nice; that people give us the worst reputation; we’re a new kind of KKK, and we want to sell those things, look at them, none of them is about hate speech. We wouldn’t allow that because it’s very obvious. I don’t necessarily agree with you on the fact that we are in a blurry place on Wix, on the stack. We are very clear that, use our software for anything you want, but don’t spread hate, don’t spread pedophiles, don’t do scam sites, don’t do any of those things.

Here’s what I’ll say. That is more clarity from a platform CEO than I’ve heard in a long time. I’ve had other platform CEOs on, and I’ve asked similar questions, and there is, I think, immediate retreat to ambiguity or the need for a law or, “Someone else should do it,” or, “We’re not going to discuss our rules in that way.” It seems like you have a lot of clarity here. Do you think that clarity has been heightened by the war? Do you think that it has been shaped by it?

No. No, I think that policy’s been existing for a very long time. And by the way, we are very proud of it. One of the reasons we never went into China, which probably cost us a lot of money, is that it was obvious what it requires, what it entailed. And we felt that this is something that we can’t do with our values, anything... That’s another example. That was always a part of it. You can do, really, almost anything you want to do with Wix. If you want to build a porn site, that’s fine. We’re not going to take it down. We’re not going to tell you anything. But once you cross the line, and that line is very clear. Hate speech, it’s pedophiles, it’s scam sites, spam sites, a lot of other things, we will immediately do our best to remove you. And I think it’s very sad that this is not a bigger phenomenon. I think that creates a lot of negative things on the planet.

Yeah. In the United States, there’s a big debate about where you would put these regulations. I think it is totally inappropriate for us to put speech regulations on internet service providers: AT&T or Comcast or whoever. We should not control what goes through the pipes. It’s too hard for people to see. It’s not a competitive space here. One level up at Cloudflare, there’s a lot of angst at the sort of Cloudflare level of service providers about content regulation, what sites they might leave up or take down or service.

You get all the way up to Instagram, they have a ton of rules, and they are happy to tell you what they are and what you can and cannot do there. And that’s a more competitive spec for consumers. I understand you’re saying you don’t think it’s blurry, but can you at least put yourself in the stack somewhere? Where do you think you sit in terms of how many rules you should have and should not have?

Well, we should have less rules than Instagram. I do understand why you don’t have porn on Instagram, because kids are exposed to that and other people that might be surprised by that. I think that the amount of safety that they should impose on content is much higher than us, which is on the web.

However, I do believe that, in many ways, we’re a publishing tool like Instagram, so in many ways, we have the same similar responsibility, just on a smaller scale. And I think that is a good thing that we are seeing companies making sure that they provide quality, which is not propagating hate or other terrible things and instead trying to mediate that.

I agree with you that I don’t think it should be imposed by the internet providers or by Amazon, AWS. I think that that is maybe one level too low. Everybody always talks about free speech, but free speech is illegal in most countries, including the United States. You cannot go and say anything you want. And if you do say a lot of things and somebody will kill you, it’ll be acceptable, and maybe for good reasons. I think, like every ideal, free speech is a beautiful ideal, but then apparently people need to manage it.

Yeah, this is the central tension, I think, of the entire internet. When you think about letting people use AI to write the copy on websites, do you think about responsibility there? Right now, it’s not necessarily your customer speech. It is Wix’s speech delivered to them through an OpenAI model. Have you put content moderation tools in that loop?

We do some things there, yes, but we never felt that there is too much of a need. We didn’t see examples where we needed to really do a lot there. Not as much, maybe, as you might think, but I think OpenAI is doing a really good job at that. It’s very hard to get the model to say something that is not politically correct.

Yeah, that is true. And they’ve been criticized for it, which is interesting.

By the way, that’s a very good question. Should OpenAI, how much should they impose that? That’s even a more interesting question than Instagram or Wix.

Especially as they begin to publish more and more of the web. Again, I think this is the most interesting question that you can ask about the modern internet: Who gets to control what and when and those forces? And who will have the clarity to just say what they think? To me, it all lands on a company like Wix, which is the underlying platform for so many people and businesses. The vast majority of them, actually.

OpenAI, it’s really interesting. Is it okay that they are very, well, kind of, I don’t know, in my mind, I’m biased into one very liberal opinion, which I share a lot of it, so maybe it’s a good thing for me personally, but is that okay that they remove a lot of the other sites? I don’t know. What do you think?

I think that OpenAI is being very careful, and I think, ideally, in a free market, other people will be less careful, and the market will pick the one that is more careful. We will see if that works.

That has been the case, for example, for social networks. The market routinely picks the social networks with more moderation even as other people yell and scream that what people want is totally unfettered speech on these networks. People, in reality, head toward the most heavily moderated networks, over and over and over again.

Interesting.

I’m curious to see if that plays out in the transformers space.

Also very interesting. I think that, essentially, it might not be the best thing for free speech, but it’s definitely the best thing for the business of OpenAI long term.

Yeah, I think the demands of the market and free speech are often in tension, and I think people pick the most comfortable experiences they can have on the internet, and those are often the most moderated ones.

I never thought about it like that. I think that’s really interesting. By the way, I think I do agree with you. I think that the more LLMs write the content that most of us read, it should be even more sensitive than Instagram or Facebook.

It’s interesting. They’re careful when it comes to political correctness. They’re not careful when it comes to factual accuracy. These are LLMs that constantly make mistakes, and there’s intention there, too, because the market does not correct for the truth.

I got to tell you something, I’m the opposite of everybody else about hallucinations. I think the hallucinations are the best part about LLM, because I think hallucinations are when the LLM is creative.

Interesting.

And I think that this is the only spark of intelligence we actually see there. I think the rest of it is just those compressed data in the neurons that is coming out. But when it comes to inventing things, this is where it kind of uses the equivalent of intuition to create low-level intelligence. I’m actually more impressed by that.

And it’s true that you cannot trust the facts that it gives you. And there’s a good chance it’s going to take a long time to fix that, as hallucinations are essentially a huge part of the algorithm. But I still think that, for me, it’s the most fascinating part of the algorithm.

Well, I cannot wait for Wix to publish an entire website made of hallucinations. I think that’d be pretty good.

Actually, you can probably do that already. We have a new version coming, which is AI that actually fully creates the website for you. It’s a very, very modern generation of ADI that we did in 2016. And maybe we can give it a mode to make everything hallucinated.

“You’re a doctor, but let’s make everything up.” Is that something you have to think about? “Okay, we have a bunch of business clients, we should not hallucinate facts about their business.” Is that a control that you have or something you’re thinking about?

Well, yeah, of course. This is actually one of the big things that we always have to work with. And to make sure that it’s obvious what is a text that it was reading for the business owner, and what is the text that it should review, and what is the text that it shouldn’t review, and how do we give them tools to fix it and to correct things and to make sure that they don’t repeat.

And this is even getting more complex in some of our projects where it’s not just one interaction but multiples. But I think everybody who’s using LLMs for anything real is facing similar challenges. And the issue is that the hallucination is essentially a huge part of the algorithm. It’s going to be very hard to take it out and getting something that is factually corrected without just going around and doing searching, if that’s the correct answer, by doing search.

I’m obsessed with this entire situation right now.

You mean about…

AI and the web. I’m obviously very interested in free speech, and there’s a real tension there. If almost all the speech on the web is created by an AI that OpenAI is making careful.

It’s almost there. I think that, from what I understand, currently, there are probably around 8 million bots running and managing most of the messaging on the internet, which is insane. Think about it. Just think about it. You’re having a conversation on things, and the ones who push agendas are bots run by AI models, not humans anymore. And this is like, “What?” And we are at version 0.1. We’re not even at version 1.0 of that. I think that 10 years from today, the human mind will be so heavily influenced by bots and by AI models that we can’t even imagine that. And that is really scary because… I think it’s super fascinating. It’s really going to be probably one of the most important subjects of the near future.

My firm belief is that there will be an internet for robots and an internet for people, and the people will not allow the robots on the internet.

That’ll be amazing.

The market will actually demand people.

How do you distinguish?

I don’t know, but I see that split. I can see it in our own audience. I can see it in the products and services that I want to use. I can see it from my friends — that everyone would rather have a person than a bot. Even if the bot is very convincing, everyone would rather read a person than LLM output.

I think it’s actually different… I think what’s interesting right now is the engineers that I talk to, they love the code. They love that it can do programming with them. And then the people that I talk to, the nonengineers, are looking at the written output, and they’re like, “This is horrible.” I’m going to use an LLM to write an email to someone who’s going to have an LLM read the email and write an LLM email back to me. That is a disaster loop. And we’d rather just have people, and I think there’s a real split coming.

But I got to say, I love the coding thing. I love Copilot. I think it’s fantastic, especially when you’re old like me and you don’t code every day, then what happens is that you don’t remember the syntax all the time, and it just does it for you immediately. That’s fantastic.

But I also use it. English is not my first language. And for me, when I write something and I want to make it a bit better, I use ChatGPT for that, and that’s really helpful. But it’s usually my message. I got to say, I think both uses are fine. And yes, probably I would love to hear your interview with you and not with an AI who tried to do the average of what you said over all the conversations that it trained on. That’s probably going to be extremely boring, right?

Yeah.

But I hope so. I don’t know. I think it’s going to be interesting. I think the Trump election was the first one where we’ve seen the massive effect of bots — or at least it was suspected, I don’t know if it’s true or not, I never managed to understand — on the election, and I think it’s just growing every day. I think we’re seeing it every day, that there’s going to be more and more influence of bots on our life, on our opinions, on the creation of human interaction, on fake news, on so many other things. It’s really, in many ways, as you said, scary.

Yeah, and that’s what I mean. I think the market will pick. If I was starting a social network today, I would say, “I’m starting a social network, and we will not have bots.” And I think that would be very difficult to do. I don’t think that would be—

But how? That’s what concerns me. I’m not sure I understand how.

There’s stuff you can do that’s very uncomfortable. You can do a bunch of driver’s license verification. You can have people show up to an office and put their thumbprint on something. There’s all this stuff you can do.

Oh, right. You can do that. You can do that. Okay.

You can link it to a Facebook profile and—

Those are probably mostly owned by bots.

… piggyback on Facebook’s verification. There’s stuff you can do. I don’t know if any of it will be successful. I don’t know if any of it will be good, but there are attempts to do this thing that I think are somewhat fascinating.

I tend to believe that it will be necessary because, if not, we’re going to need to be in a place that most of our online conversations are going to be not with humans. I think we both can agree on that. LLM is what? The first article was written in 2017. That is transformer-based architecture. And we are what?

Yeah, “Attention is All You Need.” And we are just starting. We’re not even version, as I said, 0.1, and it can already imitate behavior completely, again, with very processed and repeated information, but it can carry very clear messaging. And what will happen in 10 years? We’re going to have... Just the amount of resources placed into that now is exponentially bigger than it was in 2018 or 2019 or 2020. And it keeps growing. And of course, you can now make full Instagram profiles of people that don’t exist and images from them everywhere.

Instagram doesn’t love it. I think they’re going to have to figure out a way to detect that stuff. YouTube is trying to detect that stuff. But I really do, my belief, maybe this is my hope because I’m a person who writes, but my belief is that the market will put a premium on people, and that will actually have a number of crazy downstream effects.

I really hope so because, if not, it’s going to be a concern. I always tell my wife that I think we should make sure that our daughter has a profession that is AI-resistant, resilient. And then, she’s like, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, she should probably—”

My mom still asks me if I should be a doctor. She’s like, “The world will always need doctors.” I’m like, “I can’t do it anymore, mom.”

I should tell her that, actually, doctors are probably not AI-resilient.

Oh, no.

Actually, they will be replaced by AI at some point. I always said, “a PlayStation professional player.” And there, she has an advantage as a girl, I think, right?

Yeah.

They have an advantage. And then a TikTok influencer, but apparently a TikTok influencer can be replaced by AI, so maybe that’s not going to work.

Avishai, you’ve given me so much more time than I asked for. I really appreciate it. What’s next for Wix? What should people be looking for?

I think number one is that you’re going to see some really good projects built with AI that are coming. And we spoke about them, and I’m very excited. The first one that we’ve released has seen tremendous results, measurable results, the first couple of projects, which I’m very excited about.

More than once, I was surprised by how much of a difference it made or how engaged people are with AI models. We’re going to continue to evolve Wix Studio, which is our developers agencies product for agencies. It’s been doing very well so far. We just launched it. And I think the next version is actually going to have some really interesting way of how to manage your data and design. Again, some of it is powered by AI, some by algorithms, but I think there are a lot of really cool things that you can change, so a lot of that.

Alright. Well, I look forward to the entire next version of The Verge being published by AI and Wix. I think it’ll be a good time. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

A pleasure. Cheers.",technology
"The iPhone SE 4 has been tipped to get the same battery as the iPhone 14, which could give the next-generation affordable iPhone a decent boost in electrical endurance.

This titbit of information comes from a claimed anonymous source talking to MacRumors, and this appears to corroborate other rumors that the SE 4 will reuse the iPhone 14’s battery. It would also then suggest that the next iPhone SE will drop the dated design of the iPhone SE 3 and sport a size and look that’s similar to the iPhone 14; think flat sides, a 6.1-inch display and potential Face ID – we don't expect to see the Dynamic Island make it across, however.

While Apple doesn't officially state how large its iPhone batteries are, the iPhone 14 is believed to hold a 3,279mAh cell, which, if it makes it into the next SE, would be a big boost over the 2,010mAh battery in the iPhone SE 3.

In our lab testing, we managed to get 9 hours and 5 minutes of battery life out of the iPhone SE 3, whereas the iPhone 14 lasted for 9 hours and 28 minutes – though the latter is a more powerful phone with a larger display. So, we could expect the iPhone SE 4 to build out on that, potentially delivering some of the best iPhone battery life yet.

When can we expect the iPhone SE 4?

With this new information, it feels like a bit more life has been breathed into the iPhone SE 4 rumor mill, which has been slow of late.

The original iPhone SE has been rendered obsolete by Apple and now sits as a vintage iPhone, while the last iPhone SE came out in 2022, but lacked much in the way of compelling features. So, the iPhone SE is definitely a ripe candidate for a refresh.

Going by the rumors so far, we could see that refresh next year or in 2025; the jury is still out on a firmer release date. Given the potential repurposing of the iPhone 14’s battery, though, I’d be more inclined to predict a 2024 release date, maybe even as soon as the first half of the year. In the meantime, if you want an affordable phone, check out our list of the best cheap phones you can buy today.",technology
"Skull and Bones is quickly becoming the Duke Nukem of the ‘20s as Ubisoft has announced, in response to poor overall sales and an economic downturn, that it is yet again postponing the pirate simulator.

In a press release and subsequent investor call, Ubisoft said it was “surprised” that Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope and Just Dance 2023 underperformed. As a result, Ubisoft said it would push the release of Skull and Bones to 2024.

Delays and Skull and Bones are becoming synonymous with the game being pushed back almost every year since 2018. This latest delay, the game’s fifth overall, will put Skull and Bones — that, according to Kotaku, started in 2013 as Assassin’s Creed DLC — in its 11th year of development. Ironically, Skull and Bones isn’t Ubisoft’s only game stuck firmly in development hell, as we’ve seen neither hide nor hair of Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was announced way, way back in 2008. Oof.

In addition to Skull and Bones news, the Ubisoft press release also shared that it will cancel three more unannounced projects to join the four that were canceled last year. However, the company did say that the 2023–2024 fiscal year would see the release of the next Assassin’s Creed, the new Avatar game, and other “yet-to-be-announced premium games, including a large one.”",technology
"人工知能の開発速度が速すぎるのではないか、という声は高まっている。しかし、それが減速する様子はない。

2022年11月にOpenAIがChatGPTをローンチし、人工知能（AI）技術開発競争の新たな局面を切り開いてから1年。グーグルは12月6日（米国時間)、AIにおける世界的リーダーとしての地位を再び取り戻すためのプロジェクトを発表した。

「Gemini」は、テキスト、画像、動画など、さまざまな種類の情報に対応できる「マルチモーダル」なAIモデルだ。これはグーグルのアルゴリズムで、PageRankに続いて最も重要なものになるかもしれない。PageRankは、検索エンジンを世間に浸透させ、グーグルを巨大企業に成長させたものだ。

Geminiの初期バージョンは、グーグルのチャットボット「Bard」（英語版）内で展開されている。これは、テキスト対応のバージョンで、今後170以上の国と地域で利用可能になる予定だ。グーグルによると12月13日からは、開発者向けに、Google CloudのAPIを通じた利用もできるようになるという。

Geminiは「今後数カ月」のうちに、ジェネレーティブ検索、広告、Chromeを含む、ほかのグーグル製品にも導入される予定だと同社は語っている。最もパワーのあるGeminiのバージョンであるGemini Ultraは「さらなる信頼性と安全性のチェック」を経て、2024年に登場する予定だとグーグルは話している。

「生まれつきのマルチモーダル」

「とても重要な瞬間だと感じています」。Google DeepMindの最高経営責任者（CEO）のデミス・ハサビスは、今回の発表に先立って『WIRED』に対して次のように語った。「わたしたちはGeminiのパフォーマンスに本当に興奮しています。これを使って人々が何をしようとしているのか見るのも楽しみです」

GoogleはGeminiのことを「生まれつきのマルチモーダル」だと表現している。その理由は、Geminiがテキストだけでなく、画像や動画でもトレーニングを受けているからだ。近年流行している生成AIのコアにある大規模言語モデル（LLM）は、テキストでトレーニングをされている。

Google DeepMindの製品担当バイスプレジデントであるイーライ・コリンズは記者説明会で、Geminiについて「わたしたちの最大かつ最も高性能なモデルであり、最も一般的なモデルです」と述べた。

グーグルによると、Geminiには3つのバージョンがある。最大で最も能力の高いGemini Ultra、かなり小型で効率的な Gemini Nano、中型で中程度の能力を持つGemini Proだ。

ChatGPTに似たチャットボットであるグーグルのBardは、Gemini Proを搭載した。この変更により、より高度な推論やプランニングが可能になると同社は述べている。

また、Gemini Proの特別バージョンがAlphaCodeの新バージョンに搭載された。これはGoogle Deep Mindが提供するコーディングのための「研究製品」生成ツールだ。

小規模なモデルであるNanoは「Pixel 8 Pro」のスマートフォンに搭載され、メッセージへの返信を提案する機能が提供される。

Gemini Ultraは、2024年にバードに組み込まれ、クラウドAPIを通じて利用可能になる予定だ。",technology
"Amazon is not the only retailer that piles in on Cyber Monday. Far from it. But it is perhaps the most aggressive in its price matching, bullying its way to sales supremacy and batting away any retail pretenders after its crown. You'll also find a few discounts at Amazon you won't get elsewhere. And not just because Amazon stocks just about everything, including pillows that emulate a giant loaf of bread (not part of the sales, sadly.)

And Amazon makes stuff. There are all those Echo speakers, the wonderful Kindle e-readers, an army of Black Mirror adjacent smart home cameras, and now even TVs. You'll find some of these below, alongside a bunch of deals that are either among the best or the most popular. For the whole kaboodle of retailers, check out our main UK page of the best Cyber Monday deals for 2023.

This simple but attractive wireless speaker was crowned “best overall” in our group test earlier this year. It’s an 18.4cm-tall Bluetooth column that uses two active drivers and two passive radiators to provide a surprisingly full-bodied representation of your favorite music. Its battery lasts up to 15 hours, the IP67 water resistance can handle full submersion and it even floats.

Buying this is a clear sign you have more money than sense or no sense at all. But it is undeniably neat. It’s a voice-controller Optimus Prime that, yes, actually transforms from the iconic truck into its 41cm tall robot form. Responds to 39 different commands and has 27 motors that make it move. A wild, nerdy indulgence.

If you’re considering the AirPods Pro, you should also consider the Fit Pro, labeled “best earbuds” in our headphones group test. They connect beautifully with iPhones thanks to their Apple H1 chip, have active noise cancellation, and far better-balanced sound than you might guess from a pair of Beats earphones.

£40 for a Tamagotchi? That’s right, but this is a next-gen version with a color screen and more involved play because it has a built-in camera. We can’t guarantee your kids will love this thing as much as you did the original back in the late 90s. But if you’re just here for nostalgia, the classic version is also available for around £15.

The fairly affordable pricing of these Anker earphones won them a runner-up award in our best headphones group test, pitted against some much more expensive pairs. They have active noise cancellation built in, the battery lasts up to 10 hours. Factor in the case battery and you can keep listening for 50 hours without needing a recharge. Impressive.

It may sound pricey for a non-Pro iPad, but this tablet has had a storage upgrade, to 256GB from the Air's base 64GB. It’s also the generation of iPad Air with an Apple M1 processor, as seen in older-series MacBooks. Apple has not upgraded its tablet line to the newer processors yet. It isn’t expected to do so until next year. It's the current model, and therefore not a discount based on shelf-clearing.

The Google Pixel 7 is old news. It’s redundant. But the cheaper Pixel 7a? That’s still a current model, as the Pixel 8A isn’t expected until 2024. It just missed out on a WIRED Recommends badge at review, thanks to its so-so battery life, but still came away with an entirely respectable score (8/10). The performance is excellent, it’s highly water resistant and has a great camera, just like the pricier Pixel phones.

Reductions on AirPods Pro earphones are never that dramatic. However, we do think this Cyber Monday deal is good enough to tip many over from not owning a pair to owning one. And much as we’d love to poke a hole in Apple’s work—as we could do with some earlier AirPods—the AirPods Pro are really rather good. Their tuning is great, balancing faithful tonality with mainstream sonic appeal, and the active noise cancellation is super-effective.

This must be among the very best Xbox Series bargains of all time. Microsoft’s full-bore power console for less than the cost of a lower-mid-range graphics card. It’s a dazzler of a deal. You can spend £10 more to get the Forza Horizon 5 bundle with Hot Wheels expansion, a package that would be red hot were the game not included with Xbox Game Pass. That’s Microsoft’s Netflix for games-style service. Alternatively, there’s a Diablo IV bundle for £390.

Sony’s latest flagship street headphones. The Sony WH-1000XM5 provides excellent sound and active noise cancellation, which earned them a WIRED Recommends badge and a 9/10 score back in 2022. If you find the cost too steep, you can also pick up the previous WH-1000XM4 for £198. They are quite similar, and both have a bass-boosted sound, which can work well when out in town.

This is a great monitor for work, at a big discount. It’s a 1440p screen with excellent viewing angles, solid color and a USB-C connector for easy pairing with today’s laptops. The 4K version is also available from Dell for £225.

Like the best gear from Hisense, this 55-inch TV offers an awful lot for not that much money. It has a high 144Hz refresh rate panel with VRR. Advanced local dimming makes the contrast and black levels appear excellent for an LCD TV. And it’s a miniLED set with Quantum Dot tech, unusually advanced for £680.

Get started on your New Year’s resolutions early with a smart scale that analyses your body composition as well as your weight. Muscle mass, fat percentage, and the dreaded BMI: all here. Powered using AAAs. Batteries included, motivation is not.

Christmas entertainment sorted. This LEGO set depicts the Hogwarts Castle and its surroundings and is comprised of 2,660 bricks. Build time is estimated at around eight hours, and you can pay £150 for this today directly from LEGO. Kids will need help with this one, and it’s recommended for builders aged 18+.

Once upon a time, this laptop would have cost more than £1500. It’s a top-spec model with 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an Intel i7-1195G7 processor. That CPU is old, but it’s roughly on par with the latest-generation Core i5 made for slim and light laptops. The real appeal here is, of course, the mad dual-screen design. It’s surprisingly usable, with a good keyboard and touchpad built-in.

All of Amazon’s Fire series tablets are on sale this Black Friday. Pick one that suits your needs, but we suggest starting with the Amazon Fire HD 10. It’s cheap, has a big screen primed for movie streaming and the display is pretty bright for a budget tablet. The top-end Fire Max 11 is on sale too, but bear in mind these tablets use Amazon’s Appstore rather than Google Play, which has a more limited app selection. Amazon tablets are best at the basics.

The silver version of this machine is on a Cyber Monday deal at £500. But if you can stomach the equally dashing black, you can snag an extra £50 off. These are among the best mainstream coffee machines, but you need to be up for just a touch of manual exertion. The Barista Express does have a grinder, but it’s up to you to move the hopper to the brew section and slot it in to tamp down the grounds. However, it still involves minimal mess, and you get the illusory sense of being a barista.

Arcade1UP makes recreations of popular arcade machines. They were starting to seem a bit samey, but the new 2023 range features some with bespoke controls like this steering wheel cabinet of The Fast & Furious. It includes two arcade games of the series, the 2006 original and the follow-up The Fast & The Furious: Drift. If this is all a bit too modern for you, the vector-based graphics Star Wars arcade machine is available for £560.

The Ambeo range of soundbars from Sennheiser is hard to beat for simple audio quality. We rated the original Ambeo from 2019 highly at review. And, contrary to what you might guess, this Ambeo Plus is the slightly smaller, more affordable version. The original design is now known as the Ambeo Max, and costs twice as much even with a Cyber Monday discount. It's £1,800, down from £2,200. Both sound excellent but bear in mind these soundbars do not currently pair with rear satellite speakers, unlike the Sonos rivals, just optional subwoofers.

Save big with this premium De’Longhi bean-to-cup coffee machine. There are good deals to be had on more affordable models, but this one could save you a fortune on specialty coffees year-round because it makes speedy cold brew and iced drinks, as well as your favorite hot coffees. It boasts touchscreen control and cleans itself.

This Ninja air fryer family has become the “go-to” series for new air fryer buyers. It’s so popular the 9.5L version has sold out, but the mid-table 7.6L one is still available. However, for the best deal, you might want to ditch Amazon altogether and pick up the 9.5L Ninja for £10 more from Argos.

Logitech is a mouse master. Lots of its higher-end mice are for gamers, but the Master 2S takes the features of those models and puts them into a more mass-market design. We used one of these Master-series mice for more than a year. They’re dead comfy, and have more buttons than we ever thought to use. This is a Bluetooth mouse, so can be used with devices other than laptops and PCs too.

This is the budget version of the QuietComfort QC45. However, the difference boils down to having a soft case or a hard case. And given how carelessly we treat our headphones much of the time, case quality isn’t going to make a whole heap of a difference. We said the Bose QC45 were not all that competitive at review (7/10) but they deliver the goods at this price: sumptuous comfort, highly effective noise cancellation, and smooth, easygoing sound.

We had not pictured the Meta Quest 2 being one of the stars of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it has become just that. It’s a better deal than it at first appears too. £50 Amazon credit is added to your account when you buy, the next best thing to paying just £200 for the headset itself. So, sure, while the recently-released Meta Quest 3 is better, it’s also a helluva lot more expensive at £480. Improvements include sharper-looking lenses, dual screens for fewer wasted pixels, and a much more powerful processor. There’s a lot of fun to be had with the older headset, mind.

This pair of Amazon-exclusive (the finish, not the entire line) headphones comes around just about every big sales period, bringing with it a waft of homely nostalgia. Why? These are wired, open-back hi-fi headphones. No active noise cancellation. No wireless. Absolutely no use at all on public transport. But we love headphones like this, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find something more comfortable, and better-sounding, at this price for late-night movies and gaming sessions.

Apple’s Pencil styluses for iPads are great, but their prices don’t half attach some thorns to an iPad purchase for folks who want to try out digital art. Black Friday doesn’t solve that problem, but it blunts those thorns a bit. You can get the first and second-generation Apple Pencils from Amazon at £30-40 off. Make sure you look up which Pencil model is supported by your tablet, as these things are not cross-generational.

Amazon now makes TVs. And there are two tiers of its line-up. The basic 4-series ones are a bit like the sets you might buy in the supermarket. Cheap TVs to fill a hole. The Omni line is much more special. These are QLED sets, with Samsung tech, which use VA panels to provide good contrast in dimly lit rooms. There’s even local dimming, very unusual in a sub-£500 TV. Amazon TVs come with the company’s Fire TV interface built-in too. Sure, it’s not as exciting as a fancy OLED or miniLED, but the picture quality is good and they are hundreds of pounds cheaper. Especially so during this sales period.

You can always expect Amazon's own-brand devices to go on sale during big events like Cyber Monday. But the classic Kindle e-reader is up there with our favorites. You can pick the basic £69 model if you like without missing out on too much, as it has a backlit screen these days. However, the Paperwhite marks a good level-up, with a higher-resolution E Ink display and excellent water resistance. The big-pocketed can also check out the Kindle Scribe, a giant note-taking e-reader with a stylus and a 10.2-inch screen.",technology
"To live in London in 2023 is to be perpetually engulfed in a cloud of cloyingly sweet vapor. The scent of Blue Razz Lemonade replaces traffic fumes; Banana Ice covers the rancid smell of rubbish.

Disposable vapes are everywhere. Sleeker-looking than their bulkier, refillable counterparts, easier to get your hands on, and cheaper too, their use has exploded in popularity among adults—and, alarmingly, among young people.

A 2023 report from the UK’s anti-smoking foundation, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), found that one in five children had tried vaping, with almost 70 percent saying their most frequently used vape was disposable. In November, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its annual National Youth Tobacco Survey; it found that disposable vapes were the most common type of ecigarette used by young people across America.

This popularity has caused something of a panic. Doctors are calling for bans; schools have set up vape detectors. In early 2021, both smoking and vaping were actually on the decline among young people aged between 18 and 24 years old in the UK. Then disposable vapes came along and numbers shot up.

The use of ecigarettes among young people has tripled in the past three years. This, says Harry Tattan-Birch, a research fellow at University College London, is “crazy.” And as vaping rates rise, you’d expect to see a correspondingly steep decline in smoking, but that also hasn’t happened—which means that overall nicotine use is rising in the UK. As a result, says Tattan-Birch, specific concerns about disposable vapes need addressing.

The big question is whether younger people who use ecigarettes would’ve likely started smoking regardless. Data shows there’s now a growing proportion of young people that probably wouldn't have smoked otherwise who are using them, says Sharon Cox, the principal research fellow of the Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group at University College London. The important thing now, adds Cox, is to work out whether this is a trend. Are disposable vapes simply a fad that’ll eventually fall out of fashion, or are young people going to continue to use them recreationally? Instead of waiting for that to play out, “now is the time to act,” she says.

A variety of things make disposable vapes so alluring to young people. For one, their low price—only about $6.20—is cheaper than the average price of a packet of cigarettes. Convenience is another factor. Instead of having to individually buy all the different parts required for a refillable ecigarette, disposable vapes are rigged and ready to go—“perfectly tailored to give a nice nicotine hit without much brain power,” says Hattan-Birch. They’re sleek and brightly colored. On TikTok, people match their vape to their outfits.",technology
"In a hypothetical, nonpartisan special election, Cuomo would receive 22 percent of the vote, with city Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, a progressive, capturing 15 percent of the 600 registered city voters surveyed this month. Kathryn Garcia, who nearly won the mayoralty in 2021 and now works for Gov. Kathy Hochul, ranked third with 12 percent in Slingshot’s poll. (Cuomo, who hails from a political family, has by far the highest name recognition of the group.)

A plurality of voters — 35 percent — were undecided when presented with 12 candidates. Former GOP mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa, who plans to run again, garnered 9 percent as the only Republican in the Slingshot matchup.

For now, these scenarios are all a bit of fan fiction: Adams has vigorously defended himself and his campaign and is raising money for a 2025 reelection bid.

“Another day, another misleading poll, but this one by the same pollster who got the 2021 mayoral race completely wrong,” Deputy Mayor Fabien Levy said, referring to Slingshot’s work polling on behalf of Andrew Yang’s losing mayoral campaign. “Let’s stop spreading false narratives by want-to-be candidates who are not going to be on the ballot. Crime is down and jobs are up, and that’s because Mayor Adams continues to deliver for the working people of this city every day, but attempting to tear down the city’s second Black mayor for blatant political purposes is shameful.”

Cuomo, who has a 46-42 approval rating, would lead Williams by six points in the first round of one imagined ranked-choice ballot — a system put in place two years ago that allows New Yorkers to select up to five candidates. In another, with fewer contenders, he would beat Williams in the first round by 11 points.

The former governor resigned from office after the harassment allegations, which he denies, were memorialized in a report from state Attorney General Letitia James. The erstwhile executive is still very much focused on vindicating himself — waging a taxpayer-funded legal campaign to cast doubt on his accusers and portray himself as a victim.

The poll was the second this week to deliver devastating news for Adams.

After a Quinnipiac University poll found him receiving a record-low approval rating of 28 percent, Slingshot found the mayor had a 37-56 job approval rating.

Despite the bruising numbers, Adams’ base of Black voters was far more sympathetic to him amid the FBI investigation. Half said the city’s second Black mayor should not resign if he is indicted and should instead wait for the legal process to play out. A majority of every other racial group felt otherwise. (Adams has said his campaign followed the law and that he is cooperating with the probe.)

While Adams’ approval numbers are better than the Quinnipiac poll earlier this week, the results from Slingshot reflect similar findings — undercutting attempts from City Hall to paint the Quinnipiac results as misleading.

Slingshot, for example, found a low job approval rating among Hispanic voters, who were crucial to the mayor’s 2021 coalition. Only 35 percent of those surveyed approved of the job the mayor was doing, compared to 55 percent who disapproved.

Those numbers were on par with white voters and those who identified as “other.”

Half of Hispanic voters also said Adams should be removed from office by the governor if he is indicted — the only racial subgroup to tilt toward expulsion.

Meanwhile, just 29 percent of Asian voters — another group heavily wooed by the Adams camp ahead of his successful 2021 win — approved of his job performance, compared to 62 percent who disapproved.

Adams also had low support with voters age 55 and older — a crucial demographic within the Democratic Party.

A Slingshot representative said no one commissioned the private survey. Last month, Slingshot’s Evan Roth Smith made waves when he flagged on X a different poll assessing Cuomo’s chances in a mayoral run. He wrote he was “highly confident” that Cuomo had ordered the survey.

The news comes as Adams grapples with the federal probe.

FBI agents conducted a series of raids and interviews Nov. 2 searching for evidence the mayor’s 2021 campaign colluded with the Turkish government and accepted illicit foreign donations.

No one has been charged in the probe. But that has not stopped his political opponents from marshaling forces in response to what they perceive as a weakened executive being dogged by stories about his ties to Turkey, coupled with New Yorkers’ growing dissatisfaction over proposed budget cuts and housing costs.",political
"Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, and a slew of other companies plan to spend more than $57 million cumulatively to fight climate change by spreading crushed rock over farmland.

The aim is to use rocks’ natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which might sound low-tech, but speeding up the process and finding a way to reliably measure how much CO2 is sequestered has proven pretty hard. It’s a tactic for trapping planet-heating carbon dioxide called “enhanced weathering” that researchers have studied for decades, but it has lagged behind other emerging technologies in moving to commercialization.

The deal was announced today by Frontier, a carbon removal initiative led by Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, and McKinsey Sustainability. Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, Workday, Zendesk, Canva, and Boom Supersonic are also among the more than a dozen companies that signed onto the deal.

It’s a tactic for trapping planet-heating carbon dioxide called “enhanced weathering” that researchers have studied for decades, but it has lagged behind other emerging technologies in moving to commercialization

Their offtake agreements are with agtech startup Lithos Carbon, which says it has developed a way to empirically measure how much carbon is trapped through enhanced weathering rather than having to rely on models.

Essentially, the companies are banking on alkaline rocks that absorb CO2 from the air when they break down or “weather.” In nature, this happens when rain, wind, or waves work away at the rocks. Unassisted, this process of trapping CO2 might take thousands of years.

People can intervene by grinding rocks like basalt into gravel or dust to speed up the process. Doing so and then splaying the crushed rock out across a swath of land increases surface area and exposes it to more ambient carbon dioxide to absorb.

Lithos gives crushed basalt to farmers to spread across their fields for free; they might use it to manage the pH balance of the soil. The basalt then reacts with rainwater to trap carbon dioxide in the air as a bicarbonate. Eventually, the bicarbonate moves through groundwater out to the sea where Lithos expects it to be stored for at least 10,000 years or longer.

Then comes the really hard part: Lithos has to be able to tell companies how much carbon dioxide has been captured and safely stored. The company says it does this by taking soil samples, monitoring the chemical composition of the soil as a way to judge how much CO2 was removed. It’s a process that grew out of research at Yale University.

It’s crucial to get this part right, not only to assure that companies are getting what they pay for but also to show that they’re actually combating climate change

It’s crucial to get this part right, not only to assure that companies are getting what they pay for but also to show that they’re actually combating climate change. When it comes to Lithos’ method for measuring how much carbon dioxide is sequestered, “this is very challenging,” says Oliver Jagoutz, professor of geology at MIT. “And while I see this as a newer approach, I’m very critical whether that is a game changer.”

“[Lithos’ measurement] method is incremental improvement, but there are still major unresolved questions,” Jagoutz tells The Verge.

Data shared by the company in a pre-print study essentially show “an absolute maximum estimate of what can be, and the reality unfortunately is much more complicated,” he added. Namely, there’s a risk of overestimating how much carbon dioxide has been sequestered when not fully accounting for how fertilizers in the soil affect the process.

There are other potential side effects to try to avoid with enhanced weathering. Flooding any particular area with too much bicarbonate is one issue, since that could have its own effects on ecosystems. The environmental footprint of mining, crushing, and transporting rock need to be taken into consideration, too. Lithos uses waste material from quarries to minimize those kinds of impacts. At farms, it’ll also be important to make sure the dust doesn’t get airborne and affect air quality.

But if all those challenges can be overcome, Jagoutz is optimistic about the future of enhanced weathering as a strategy for fighting climate change. “I think it’s great that people try new methods and go to the field level with these different ideas that have been circulating,” he says.

To be sure, environmental advocates have also voiced concern about companies paying to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere rather than focusing all their efforts on preventing fossil fuel emissions by transitioning to clean energy.

To that end, Lithos CEO Mary Yap says she sees its strategy as more of a “mop” than a cure-all for climate change. “You cannot mop up a flood ... definitely stop the flood or else all of us are doomed ... But you do need a mop because the faucet might not be completely off yet,” she says. You also need the “mop” to take care of damage that’s been done already, she says, in this case by greenhouse gas emissions that have built up in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.

This $57.1 million offtake agreement for enhanced weathering is the first of its kind, according to Frontier. That’s supposed to cover the costs of sequestering more than 154,000 tons of CO2 by 2028, equivalent to taking about 34,000 cars off the road for a year. Breaking down to roughly $370 per ton of CO2 removed, it’s still costly but notably cheaper than new industrial plants being built to filter the greenhouse gas out of the air for around $600 a ton.",technology
"Around noon on Nov. 17, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, logged into a video call from a luxury hotel in Las Vegas. He was in the city for its inaugural Formula 1 race, which had drawn 315,000 visitors including Rihanna and Kylie Minogue.

Mr. Altman, who had parlayed the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot into personal stardom beyond the tech world, had a meeting lined up that day with Ilya Sutskever, the chief scientist of the artificial intelligence start-up. But when the call started, Mr. Altman saw that Dr. Sutskever was not alone — he was virtually flanked by OpenAI’s three independent board members.

Instantly, Mr. Altman knew something was wrong.

Unbeknownst to Mr. Altman, Dr. Sutskever and the three board members had been whispering behind his back for months. They believed Mr. Altman had been dishonest and should no longer lead a company that was driving the A.I. race. On a hush-hush 15-minute video call the previous afternoon, the board members had voted one by one to push Mr. Altman out of OpenAI.

Now they were delivering the news. Shocked that he was being fired from a start-up he had helped found, Mr. Altman widened his eyes and then asked, “How can I help?” The board members urged him to support an interim chief executive. He assured them that he would.",technology
"The Defense Department is working to ensure that as many of the 421 officers who were confirmed to lower ranks this week — one-star to three-star — can move into their assigned spots as quickly as possible, but that process will take time, said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh.

Some officers may be assigned to a temporary posting to wait out the holds, allowing their replacements to move up.

“It’s not just flicking a switch and suddenly everyone moves into these new positions,” Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters. “All of that has to be carefully orchestrated.”

Top officials say the holdup has real-world effects, as the Pentagon deals with conflicts on multiple fronts, from supporting Ukraine and Israel to fending off attacks on ground forces in Iraq and Syria and naval forces in the Red Sea.

“When it’s unclear whether or not your senior leaders are going to be in place at the time and place they’re needed, that of course creates unnecessary friction and does have impact on readiness,” Ryder said.

In one prominent example, Tuberville is still blocking Lt. Gen. Gregory Guillot, the deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, who is nominated to be the new head of U.S. Northern Command. That means Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, who was confirmed to replace Guillot at Central Command, can’t do so.

That also means Vice Adm. George Wikoff, who was confirmed to replace Cooper as the top commander overseeing all naval forces in the Middle East, has to stay put. The Domino effect continues down the line.

Similarly at the Pentagon, Tuberville still has a hold on Lt. Gen. Jim Mingus, now serving as the director of the Joint Staff, to be the Army’s No. 2. Even though his replacement, Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, has now been approved for the promotion, he still can’t move into the new position until Mingus gets confirmed.

“We do have some cleanup to do,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said Thursday during a promotion ceremony for eight newly-confirmed officers. “I think there are some other lingering disruptions that are resulting from this process, and we’re gonna work through that just as carefully as we can.”

“This is going to take a little while to unwind from this,” added Gen. Randy George, the Army chief of staff.

Ask to provide the number of lower-level officers who are stuck, Singh said the Pentagon was still working on it.

In addition to Tuberville’s hold, a half dozen promotions below the four-star rank are still being held up by Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) over “those nominees’ stances or actions relating to divisive [diversity, equity and inclusion] programs,” according to his office.

Officers aren’t the only ones in limbo. Tuberville has retained his hold on civilian nominees up for senior positions in the Pentagon. Two picks are pending in the full Senate and subject to the hold: Nickolas Guertin, the nominee to be Navy acquisition chief, and Ronald Keohane, tapped to be assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs.

Five more nominees await action by the Armed Services Committee and would be subject to Tuberville’s hold once they are advanced, including Derek Chollet, who was tapped to be DOD’s policy chief. Chollet will face stiff opposition from Republicans if his nomination comes up for a vote. No civilian DOD nominees have been approved since April.

To get past Tuberville, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will need to file cloture and hold standalone votes to confirm the remaining 11 four-star military picks pending on the floor. A twelfth nominee, Adm. Samuel Paparo, tapped to lead Indo-Pacific Command, has not yet advanced out of committee, but will similarly need a standalone vote once he clears the panel.

“It’s obvious to me that he realized he was doing significant damage to our national security, so he lifted the holds,” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said of Tuberville. “But on the full admirals and generals, or people being promoted there, he didn’t [realize].”

Schumer hasn’t yet outlined plans to hold votes on the remaining promotions. The Senate is scheduled to go into recess for the rest of the year after next week, but some Democrats want to make sure the officers are confirmed before the end of the year.

“That’s still going to have a major impact,” Kelly said. “So we’ve got to figure out a path forward.”",political

Love him or hate him,

Napoleon is a figure probably unrivaled in modern history.

I'm going to take you some snapshot, iconic moments

in some of his battles.

[dramatic music]

Toulon, 1793,

[marker plunking]

we're down here on the Mediterranean coast of France.

Here we have the young Napoleon, 24 years old,

full of energy, full of zeal for the revolution,

and that revolution is in danger.

The city of Toulon has been occupied

by French royalists.

The young Napoleon is given the task of leading an assault

on this important fort, which he does.

The French fire at the fortress,

and then they storm it, using infantry and ladders,

and Napoleon himself leads the attack.

He's stabbed in the thigh by a British soldier

with a bayonet, but the attack succeeds,

and the British are pushed out.

[markers sliding]

The Battle of the Pyramids, 1798.

[marker plunking]

We're now away down South on the map,

on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean in Egypt.

Here, we're going to be looking at Napoleon,

experimenting with a new formation,

the divisional square, and looking at his sense of destiny.

Actually, the battle took place

some nine miles away from the pyramids,

but what's wrong with a bit of artistic license?

He has captured the city of Alexandria,

but he's now faced with the vast, medieval

infantry and cavalry of the Mamluks,

the soldiers of the Ottoman Turks who rule Egypt.

He brings on what was called the divisional square.

Each division had three brigades,

and each brigade was formed into a square of infantry,

guns at each corner, and cavalry in the middle.

Now, squares were used throughout European warfare,

but they were used for a very particular purpose,

just to repel cavalry.

So, he is adapting the square,

making it a combined arms formation

and using it offensively, not defensively.

He moves South in this formation towards the enemy,

supported by the gunfire of his ships.

The Mamluks attack and superior

French firepower murders them.

They retreat.

Some of them try to cross the Nile and are drowned,

and the French are left in possession of the field.

Austerlitz, 1805.

[marker plunking]

We are here in what's now the Czech Republic.

Here we're going to look at Napoleon,

prepared to take risks that could be fatal,

but also as a master of deception,

luring his enemies into a trap

from which they can't escape.

[dramatic music]

This is a portrayal of an incident which actually happened.

It's reported that 150 guns were lost

and a lot of men were drowned.

Two or three days later, Napoleon ordered the ponds

to be drained, and although 150 horses were found,

only two human bodies were reported.

Napoleon has instituted the corps system.

Each corps is a combination of artillery,

infantry, cavalry, engineers and light troops.

It's all arms.

It allows him to expand the army

to something bigger than there's been seen

in Europe since ancient times.

He makes himself appear weak

in the South here on his right flank

because what he wants to do

is make the enemy launch a flanking attack.

Bring them down off the Pratzen Heights

to attack him and envelop him in the South,

will be able to take these attackers

in the flank and deal with them.

Napoleon himself will then be able

to unleash the decisive act of the battle,

a central attack on the enemy position

up here on the Pratzen Heights.

The Austrians play right into his hands,

and he turns to Marshal Soult,

the Commander of the Fourth Corps.

He's going to lead the attack and says to Soult,

One sharp jab and the war is over.

[markers sliding]

Lutzen, Spring of 1813.

[marker plunking]

We are at Lutzen, which is in

the Southern part of Germany.

Here, we're going to be looking at Napoleon

making and implementing decisions

far more rapidly than his opponents can do.

And we're going to see him inspiring

and leading the troops personally

and bringing that magnetism to bear on the battlefield.

What Lutzen gives us is a glimpse

of Napoleon's powers of analysis and decision-making.

Napoleon, after all his years in the field,

is now a master at this.

What unfolds at Lutzen?

Well, it's what's called a meeting engagement,

and a meeting engagement occurs

when two bodies of troops are moving towards each other,

but they don't know very much about each other.

And unexpectedly, they collide,

and victory will go to the side

that most speedily and most effectively

takes advantage of the chaos.

Napoleon himself rides to the sound of the guns.

Morale is pretty shaky, but his appearance works magic.

The troops see him and somehow,

they know that everything will be okay.

And those cries so dreaded

by his enemies on the battlefield begin to rise.

Vive l'empereur.

Not only does he inspire the troops,

but he actually takes charge of them,

leads them to the counterattack,

exposing himself to enemy fire.

And it's said that this is the day of his career

more than any other,

when he was in most danger of being killed.

[markers sliding]

Waterloo, 1815.

[marker plunking]

We are at Waterloo, in what's now Belgium,

and it's just to the South of Brussels.

Here's Napoleon, at the end of his career.

He's older. He's tired.

He's suffering the pains of duodenal cancer.

He nearly carries the day,

but in the end, he's caught in his own trap.

[dramatic music]

Well, here we've got some great footage

of the use of squares.

We talked about squares earlier in Egypt,

and here's the defensive use of squares

by the British Army against that massed cavalry.

Ridley Scott's used enough people in it

Napoleon organizes a proper combined arms attack,

the Prussians are appearing on the French right.

Napoleon has to detach part

Once La Haye Sainte is taken,

the critical moment has arrived.

The guard, weakened as it is, is committed.

It's stopped dead.

The Prussians break through on his right flank,

Napoleon leaves the field of battle,

He did, however, leave a considerable legacy.

He reshaped armies through his corps system

To this day, he is still an iconic figure.

If that were not so,

then Ridley Scott would not have invested

as he has done in making this movie.

"Nicolas Cage knows he’s a meme. He’s not happy about it. After making the mistake of googling himself a few years back, the charismatic actor discovered that his big on-screen performances had been translated into single-frame quips and supercuts, taken—like all memes, really—out of context, played for lolz, and in a manner that, frankly, makes Cage seem like a graduate from the Jim Carrey school of rubber-faced acting.

“Something like ‘Nick Cage loses his shit,’ where they cherry-pick meltdowns from different movies I’d made over the years,” he says. “I get that it’s all done for laughs, and in that context it is funny, but at the same time, there’s no regard to how the character got there. There’s no Act One, there’s no Act Two.”

This, Cage says, is not why he got into making movies. Back in the 1980s, when he was showing up in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and as the romantic lead in Valley Girl, there was no internet, no one turning him into a TikTok template. “So, as I’ve watched these memes grow exponentially and get turned into T-shirts and ‘You don’t say?’ and all that stuff,” Cage says, “I’ve just thought, ‘Wow, I don’t know how I should feel about this,’ because it’s made me kind of frustrated and confused.”

That’s part of the reason Cage signed on to do his latest movie, the A24 drama Dream Scenario, in which he plays Paul Matthews, a downtrodden university professor who suddenly starts to appear in the dreams of millions of people around the world. Directed by Sick of Myself’s Kristoffer Borgli, the film is a clever look at the trappings of instantaneous fame and at what it looks like when someone’s fame becomes bigger than they might be themselves—something Cage, who actually changed his name and leaned into a more bombastic persona early in his career, knows a little something about.

To mark Dream Scenario’s release, WIRED talked to Cage about where he’s at with his meme-ification these days, his dislike of social media, and why he’s going to make damn sure that no one can make an AI-generated Nick Cage after he shuffles off this mortal coil.

WIRED: Over the course of the movie, Paul struggles with who he thinks he is and who the world thinks he is, and how that’s constantly shifting around him. Is that something you’ve had to deal with over the course of your career in terms of “Nick Cage, Hollywood actor” versus “Nicolas Coppola, father and human being”?",technology

Wordle hints (game #903) - clue #1 - Vowels

How many vowels does today's Wordle have? • Wordle today has a vowel in one place*.

* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).

Wordle hints (game #903) - clue #2 - first letter

What letter does today's Wordle begin with? • The first letter in today's Wordle answer is S.

S is the most common starting letter in the game, featuring in 365 of Wordle's 2,309 answers. In fact, it's almost twice as likely to begin an answer as the next most common starting letter, C.

Wordle hints (game #903) - clue #3 - repeated letters

Does today's Wordle have any repeated letters? • There are no repeated letters in today's Wordle.

Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one.

Wordle hints (game #903) - clue #4 - ending letter

What letter does today's Wordle end with? • The last letter in today's Wordle is T.

T is a very common letter to end a Wordle answer - in fact only E and Y are more likely in that position.

Today's Wordle answer (game #903)

Today's Wordle answer (game #903) is… SHIFT.

For the third day in a row we've got a Wordle starting with an S, which perhaps shouldn't be surprising given that it's the most common letter to begin an answer (and by a distance), but which is, frankly, getting a little tired now. Come on, NYT, give us some variety!

What's more, SHIFT begins with SH, just as yesterday's SHARP did (see below). SH is the second most common starting combination, behind only ST, so this is again not a huge shock.

It's slightly harder than SHARP or Thursday's SLEEP, probably because the vowel is an I rather than an E or A. That's the reason why only two of the 20 best Wordle starting words cut down the remaining options list to any great degree. SAINT and STILE both left six possible solutions, whereas most of the most popular choices were above 20. The net result of all this? An average score of 3.8, according to WordleBot.

STARE gave me a green S and yellow T, and left 23 remaining answers. With A and E ruled out, I wanted to include two more vowels, while the fact that T couldn't now follow the S meant I needed another partner for it. H fit that mould well, and by moving the T to the end I could play SHOUT.

There was obviously a small (1 in 23) chance this could be the actual answer, but that wasn't to be on this occasion. Probably just as well, as I've had my fair share of good luck recently and I don't want readers of this column thinking I might cheat (I don't, honest).

Anyway, while not correct it was still very helpful. The H and T turned green, but the O and U both went gray, so I was almost certainly looking for an I instead. It didn't take me long to work out that SHIFT was the only possible answer now, so I played that next for another 3/6 to end a really easy week.

Yesterday's Wordle hints (game #902)

In a different time zone where it's still Friday? Don't worry – I can give you some clues for Wordle #902, too.

Wordle yesterday had a vowel in one place.

* Note that by vowel we mean the five standard vowels (A, E, I, O, U), not Y (which is sometimes counted as a vowel too).

The first letter in yesterday's Wordle answer was S.

S is the most common starting letter in the game, featuring in 365 of Wordle's 2,309 answers. In fact, it's almost twice as likely to begin an answer as the next most common starting letter, C.

There were no repeated letters in yesterday's Wordle.

Repeated letters are quite common in the game, with 748 of the 2,309 Wordle answers containing one. However, it's still more likely that a Wordle doesn't have one.

The last letter in yesterday's Wordle was P.

P is a middling end letter in Wordle. It features in 56 answers, which places it 12th in the alphabet. Don't expect it to happen that often compared to the likes of E, Y and T.

Yesterday's Wordle answer has an edge to it.

Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #902)

(Image credit: New York Times)

Yesterday's Wordle answer (game #902) was… SHARP.

Are you getting a touch of deja vu here? Because I certainly am. Just like yesterday's puzzle (see below), today's Wordle answer starts with an S, ends with a P and should be really rather easy for most people to solve.

SHARP doesn't have the repeated E that SLEEP does, which theoretically should make it easier than yesterday's. But Wordle isn't quite as straightforward as that, and in reality SHARP has a higher average of 3.6 (compared to 3.3 yesterday). That's still super-low, though, in the great scheme of Wordle averages (the overall average is around 4.0).

The reason why it's slightly trickier than yesterday's is almost certainly due to a slightly worse performance from the best Wordle starting words. Yesterday, SLATE left only two answers – but today it was at 30. In fact, of the top 20 words according to WordleBot, the best result was for STARE – and that still left 11 options.

STARE is of course the starter word I begin with daily, a choice I made way back in January 2022 and which I am now seemingly stuck with. That's because if I start with something else – even for just one day – I am certain that the universe will punish me by making that day the one in which STARE is the answer. I couldn't bear the chance of missing out on a 1/6 that way, so STARE it is for now…

Anyway, today that decision worked out well for me, because a lot of the hard work had already been done for me. All I needed to do was find a good second word that cut down those options. In order to do that, I needed to know what they were, of course – and managed to come up with nine of them myself. These were SCARF, SCARY, SHARP, SHARD, SWARM, SNARL, SPARK, SHARK and SNARK and the two that I missed, according to WordleBot, were both quite unlikely in my opinion (SMARM and SNARF).

A quick glance at those words makes it clear that I needed a second guess that included C, H, N and K – so I played CHINK. Though this wasn't quite guaranteed to give me the answer, with a little luck it would have done so. Unfortunately, I didn't get that luck – with only a green H, my choice was now reduced to two, SHARP or SHARD.

So, I had a classic 50/50 guess. I couldn't recall either having been a past Wordle answer, so went with the more common word, SHARP, and guessed correctly – that was the solution and I scored another nice 3/6, my sixth in the past seven games.

What is Wordle?

If you're on this page then you almost certainly know what Wordle is already, and indeed have probably been playing it for a while. And even if you've not been playing it, you must surely have heard of it by now, because it's the viral word game phenomenon that took the world by storm last year and is still going strong in 2023.

We've got a full guide to the game in our What is Wordle page, but if you just want a refresher then here are the basics.

What is Wordle? Wordle challenges you to guess a new five-letter word each day. You get six guesses, with each one revealing a little more information. If one of the letters in your guess is in the answer and in the right place, it turns green. If it's in the answer but in the wrong place, it turns yellow. And if it's not in the answer at all it turns gray. Simple, eh? It's played online via the Wordle website or the New York Times' Crossword app (iOS / Android), and is entirely free. Crucially, the answer is the same for everyone each day, meaning that you're competing against the rest of the world, rather than just against yourself or the game. The puzzle then resets each day at midnight in your local time, giving you a new challenge, and the chance to extend your streak.",technology
"“My mistake,” Sibley replied, prompting Howell to ask whether he was “falling on his sword” for the former mayor. Sibley insisted he wasn’t but rather that he simply had misunderstood Howell’s order requiring Giuliani’s presence at the hearing, the final session before the civil damages case goes before a jury next week.

Freeman and Moss have become outsized figures in the investigations into former President Donald Trump and his allies’ efforts to subvert the 2020 election. The threats targeting Moss and Freeman were featured in a sprawling racketeering indictment brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis against Trump and 18 alleged co-conspirators, including several charged specifically with targeting the election workers. Giuliani’s charges include falsely telling Georgia legislators that Freeman and Moss were “quite obviously” passing around USB drives to manipulate voting machines.

Giuliani identified the pair in surveillance video from Atlanta’s State Farm Arena and accused them of manipulating thousands of ballots, allegations that have been widely debunked and discredited. But his accusation in the final, chaotic weeks of Trump’s presidency became kindling for conspiracy theories about election fraud, and they were supercharged by Trump himself, who echoed them publicly and raised them in a phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani, along with some of his allies in conservative media, in 2021. The pair settled with One America News’ parent company, Herring Networks, last year, leaving Giuliani as the last remaining defendant. Earlier this year, Howell found that Giuliani had repeatedly defied orders to preserve and produce evidence in the lawsuit and found him liable for defaming them. A trial scheduled to begin Monday will focus on how much Moss and Freeman will receive in damages.

At Tuesday’s hearing, Howell pressed Sibley on whether Giuliani would plead the Fifth, considering he’s facing his own criminal charges in Georgia and has been identified as a Trump co-conspirator in the criminal charges Trump is facing in Washington, D.C. She noted that several witnesses pleaded the Fifth hundreds of times in depositions conducted by Freeman and Moss’ lawyers, including Jenna Ellis 448 times and Ray Smith, Jr. 309 times. Sibley said Giuliani did not intend to plead the Fifth.

After the hearing, a political adviser to Giuliani decried what he called “the weaponization of our justice system,” and he accused the judge of displaying bias.

The election workers found some measure of redemption in their public testimony before the House Jan. 6 select committee, where they described the relentless attacks and threats they faced in the aftermath of Giuliani and Trump’s comments about them. On Tuesday, they traveled into and out of the courthouse via non-public corridors and were not available to comment on the hearing.

Just minutes after their departure, federal prosecutors who have charged Trump with seeking to subvert the 2020 election indicated their intention to cite Trump and Giuliani’s attacks on Moss and Freeman during the former president’s Washington, D.C. criminal trial that is scheduled to begin March 4.

“Long after the charged conduct, the defendant continued to falsely attack two Georgia election workers despite being on notice that his claims about them in 2020 were false and had subjected them to vile, racist, and violent threats and harassment,” senior assistant special counsel Molly Gaston wrote in a nine-page court filing.

Gaston referenced Moss and Freeman’s testimony to the Jan. 6 select committee, describing their “graphic testimony about the threats and harassment they endured after the defendant and his agents falsely accused them.”

“In apparent response, the defendant then doubled down and recommenced his attacks on the election workers in posts on Truth Social,” Gaston wrote. “He even zeroed in on one of the election workers, falsely writing that she was an election fraudster, a liar, and one of the ‘treacher[ous] ... monsters’ who stole the country, and that she would be in legal trouble.”",political
"Amazon is suing a naughty but enterprising group called REKK for offering a paid service to willing shoppers looking to get big-ticket items like laptops and game consoles for cheap by exploiting its return and refund system.

This isn’t like the times you try to return a small item purchased from Amazon, like a pair of socks, and the system refunds you without telling you to send it back. As reported by Bloomberg, Amazon’s lawsuit accuses REKK of using social engineering and phishing attacks on Amazon fulfillment employees or bribes to get millions of dollars in refunds without actually sending the items back.

A text exchange shows REKK recruiting an Amazon employee. Image: US District Court

REKK advertised its services to shoppers in a Telegram channel with 30,000 followers, taking payment as a part of the item’s original price and then manipulating the system to log a return, which never happened. One example from the lawsuit shows how the scheme worked: one defendant, Andrew Ling, ordered five iPads and then worked with REKK to get a refund. In this case, REKK allegedly used a phishing attack against a fulfillment center employee to mark the iPad returns as received in Amazon’s systems.

Allegedly, one Amazon employee bribed by REKK approved 76 product returns worth over $100,000 in return for $3,500, while another was paid $5,000 to approve 56 fake returns worth over $75,000.",technology
"A few months ago, I downgraded my internet, going from a 900Mbps plan to a 200Mbps one. Now, I find that websites can sometimes take a painfully long time to load, that HD YouTube videos have to stop and buffer when I jump around in them, and that video calls can be annoyingly choppy.

In other words, pretty much nothing has changed. I had those exact same problems even when I had near-gigabit download service, and I’m probably not alone. I’m sure many of you have also had the experience of cursing a slow-loading website and growing even more confused when a “speed test” says that your internet should be able to play dozens of 4K Netflix streams at once. So what gives?

Like any issue, there are many factors at play. But a major one is latency, or the amount of time it takes for your device to send data to a server and get data back — it doesn’t matter how much bandwidth you have if your packets (the little bundles of data that travel over the network) are getting stuck somewhere. But while people have some idea about how latency works thanks to popular speed tests, including a “ping” metric, common methods of measuring it haven’t always provided a complete picture.

The good news is that there’s a plan to almost eliminate latency, and big companies like Apple, Google, Comcast, Charter, Nvidia, Valve, Nokia, Ericsson, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom, and more have shown an interest. It’s a new internet standard called L4S that was finalized and published in January, and it could put a serious dent in the amount of time we spend waiting around for webpages or streams to load and cut down on glitches in video calls. It could also help change the way we think about internet speed and help developers create applications that just aren’t possible with the current realities of the internet.

Before we talk about L4S, though, we should lay some groundwork.

Why is my internet so slow?

There are a lot of potential reasons. The internet is a series of tubes vast network of interconnected routers, switches, fibers, and more that connect your device to a server (or, often, multiple servers) somewhere. If there’s a bottleneck at any point in that path, your surfing experience could suffer. And there are a lot of potential bottlenecks — the server hosting the video you want to watch could have limited capacity for uploads, a vital part of the internet’s infrastructure could be down, meaning the data has to travel further to get to you, your computer could be struggling to process the data, etc.

The real kicker is that the lowest-capacity link in the chain determines the limits of what’s possible. You could be connected to the fastest server imaginable via an 8Gbps connection, and if your router can only process 10Mbps of data at a time, that’s what you’ll be limited to. Oh, and also, every delay adds up, so if your computer adds 20 milliseconds of delay, and your router adds 50 milliseconds of delay, you end up waiting at least 70 milliseconds for something to happen. (These are completely arbitrary examples, but you get the point.)

In recent years, network engineers and researchers have started raising concerns about how the traffic management systems that are meant to make sure network equipment doesn’t get overwhelmed may actually make things slower. Part of the problem is what’s called “buffer bloat.”

That sounds like a zombie enemy from The Last Of Us

Right? But to understand what buffer bloat really is, we first have to understand what buffers are. As we’ve touched on already, networking is a bit of a dance; each part of the network (such as switches, routers, modems, etc.) has its own limit on how much data it can handle. But because the devices that are on the network and how much traffic they have to deal with is constantly changing, none of our phones or computers really know how much data to send at a time.

To figure that out, they’ll generally start sending data at one rate. If everything goes well, they’ll increase it again and again until something goes wrong. Traditionally, that thing going wrong is packets being dropped; a router somewhere receives data faster than it can send it out and says, “Oh no, I can’t handle this right now,” and just gets rid of it. Very relatable.

While packets being dropped doesn’t generally result in data loss — we’ve made sure computers are smart enough to just send those packets again, if necessary — it’s still definitely not ideal. So the sender gets the message that packets have been dropped and temporarily scales back how its data rates before immediately ramping up again just in case things have changed within the past few milliseconds.

That’s because sometimes the data overload that causes packets to drop is just temporary; maybe someone on your network is trying to send a picture on Discord, and if your router could just hold on until that goes through, you could continue your video call with no issues. That’s also one of the reasons why lots of networking equipment has buffers built in. If a device gets too many packets at once, it can temporarily store them, putting them in a queue to get sent out. This lets systems handle massive amounts of data and smooths out bursts of traffic that could have otherwise caused problems.

I don’t get it — that sounds like a good thing

It is! But the problem that some people are worried about is that buffers have gotten really big to ensure that things run smoothly. That means packets may have to wait in line for a (sometimes literal) second before continuing on their journey. For some types of traffic, that’s no big deal; YouTube and Netflix have buffers on your device as well, so you don’t need the next chunk of video right this instant. But if you’re on a video call or using a game streaming service like GeForce Now, the latency introduced by a buffer (or several buffers in the chain) could actually be a real problem.

This visualization from a Nokia Bell Labs presentation does a decent job of showing the problem with what we’re doing now. Image: Nokia Bell Labs

There are currently some ways of dealing with this, and there have been quite a few attempts in the past to write algorithms that control congestion with an eye toward both throughput (or how much data is being transferred) and lower latency. But a lot of them don’t exactly play nice with the current widely used congestion control systems, which could mean that rolling them out for some parts of the internet would hurt other parts.

I’m paying for gigabit internet — how could I still have latency issues?

This is the trick of internet service provider, or ISP, marketing. When users say they want “faster” internet, what they mean is that they want there to be less time from when they ask for something to when they get it. However, internet providers sell connections by capacity: how much data can you suck back at once?

Bit versus byte Talking about the amount of time it takes to download files brings up another problem with how internet services are marketed. Usually, we think of file sizes in terms of bytes — a song is 10 megabytes, and a movie is 25 gigabytes. But ISPs rate connections in bits. If you miss the distinction, you’d be forgiven for thinking that a service plan that gives you a gigabit per second would let you download a movie in 25 seconds. However, bits are eight times smaller than bytes — one gigabit (Gb) is equivalent to 125 megabytes (MB), or 0.125 gigabytes (GB). So that movie is going to take over three minutes to download instead, assuming perfect conditions. (By the way, give yourself a prize if you realized that a lowercase b versus an uppercase one is how you distinguish between the two units in their abbreviated forms.)

There was a time when adding capacity really did reduce the amount of time you spent waiting around. If you’re downloading a nine-megabyte MP3 file from a totally legal website, it’s going to take a long time on 56 kilobit per second dial-up — around 21 and a half minutes. Upgrade to a blazing-fast 10Mbps connection, and you should have the song in less than 10 seconds.

But the time it takes to transfer data gets less and less noticeable as the throughput goes up; you wouldn’t notice the difference between a song download that takes 0.72 seconds on 100Mbps and one that takes 0.288 seconds on 250Mbps, even though it’s technically less than half the time. (Also, in reality, it takes longer than that because the process of downloading a song doesn’t just involve transferring the data). The numbers matter a bit more when you’re downloading larger files, but you still hit diminishing returns at some point; the difference between streaming a 4K movie 30 times faster than you can watch it versus five times faster than you can watch it isn’t particularly important.

The disconnect between our internet “speed” (usually what people are referring to is throughput — the question is less about how fast the delivery truck is going and more about how much it can carry on the trip) and how we experience those high-bandwidth connections becomes apparent when simple webpages are slow to load; in theory, we should be able to load text, images, and javascript at lightning speeds. However, loading a webpage means several rounds of back-and-forth communication between our devices and servers, so latency issues get multiplied. Packets getting stuck for 25 milliseconds can really add up when they have to make the journey 10 or 20 times. The amount of data we can move at one time through our internet connection isn’t the bottleneck — it’s the time our packets spend shuffling between devices. So, adding more capacity isn’t going to help.

So what is L4S, and how would it make my internet faster?

L4S stands for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput, and its goal is to make sure your packets spend as little time needlessly waiting in line as possible by reducing the need for queuing. To do this, it works on making the latency feedback loop shorter; when congestion starts happening, L4S means your devices find out about it almost immediately and can start doing something to fix the problem. Usually, that means backing off slightly on how much data they’re sending.

As we covered before, our devices are constantly speeding up, then slowing down, and repeating that cycle because the amount of data that links in the network have to deal with is constantly changing. But packets dropping isn’t a great signal, especially when buffers are part of the equation — your device won’t realize it’s sending too much data until it’s sending way too much data, meaning it has to clamp down hard.

Apple tested L4S on a typical network and saw a massive improvement to round-trip traffic times. More on that later. Image: Apple

L4S, however, gets rid of that lag between the problem beginning and each device in the chain finding out about it. That makes it easier to maintain a good amount of data throughput without adding latency that increases the amount of time it takes for data to be transferred.

Okay, but how does it do that? Is it magic?

No, it’s not magic, though it’s technically complex enough that I kind of wish it were, because then, I could just hand-wave it away. If you really want to get into it (and you know a lot about networking), you can read the specification paper on the Internet Engineering Task Force’s website.

L4S lets the packets tell your device how well their journey went

For everyone else, I’ll try to boil it down as much as I can without glossing over too much. The L4S standard adds an indicator to packets, which says whether they experienced congestion on their journey from one device to another. If they sail right on through, there’s no problem, and nothing happens. But if they have to wait in a queue for more than a specified amount of time, they get marked as having experienced congestion. That way, the devices can start making adjustments immediately to keep the congestion from getting worse and to potentially eliminate it altogether. That keeps the data flowing as fast as it possibly can and gets rid of the disruptions and mitigations that can add latency with other systems.

Do we need L4S?

In terms of reducing latency on the internet, L4S or something like it is “a pretty necessary thing,” according to Greg White, a technologist at research and development firm CableLabs who helped work on the standard. “This buffering delay typically has been hundreds of milliseconds to even thousands of milliseconds in some cases. Some of the earlier fixes to buffer bloat brought that down into the tens of milliseconds, but L4S brings that down to single-digit milliseconds.”

That could obviously help make the everyday experience of using the internet nicer. “Web browsing is more limited by the roundtrip time than the capacity of the connection these days for most people. Beyond about six to 10 megabits per second, latency has a bigger role in determining how quickly a web page load feels.”

However, ultra-low latency could be vital for potential future use cases. We’ve touched on game streaming, which can turn into a mess if there’s too much latency, but imagine what would happen if you were trying to stream a VR game. In that case, too much lag may go beyond just making a game less fun to play and could even make you throw up.

What can’t L4S do?

Well, it can’t bend the laws of physics. Data can only travel so fast, and sometimes it has to go a long way. As an example, if I were trying to do a video call with someone in Perth, Australia, there would be, at the very least, 51ms of latency each way — that’s how much time light takes to travel in a straight line from where I live to there, assuming it’s going through a vacuum. Realistically, it’ll take a bit longer. Light travels a bit slower through fiber optic cables, and the data would be taking a few extra hops along the path, as there isn’t actually a direct line from my house to Perth, as far as I’m aware.

This is why most services that aren’t dealing with real-time data will try to cache it closer to where you live. If you’re watching something popular on Netflix or YouTube, chances are you’re getting that data from a server relatively close to where you live, even if that’s not anywhere close to those companies’ main data centers.

There’s nothing L4S can do about that physical lag. However, it could keep much additional lag from being added on top of that.

So when do I get it?

This is the big question with any networking tech, especially after IPV6, an upgrade to the way computers find each other on the internet, has famously taken over a decade to deploy. So here’s the bad news: for the most part, L4S isn’t in use in the wild yet.

However, there are some big names involved with developing it. When we spoke to White from CableLabs, he said there were already around 20 cable modems that support it today and that several ISPs like Comcast, Charter, and Virgin Media have participated in events meant to test how prerelease hardware and software work with L4S. Companies like Nokia, Vodafone, and Google have also attended, so there definitely seems to be some interest.

Apple put an even bigger spotlight on L4S at WWDC 2023 after including beta support for it in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura. This video explains that when developers use some of the existing frameworks, L4S support is automatically built in without changing any code. Apple is progressively rolling out L4S to a random set of users with iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma, while developers can turn it on for testing.

At around the same time as WWDC, Comcast announced the industry’s first L4S field trials in collaboration with Apple, Nvidia, and Valve. That way, content providers can mark their traffic (like Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming), and customers in the trial markets with compatible hardware like the Xfinity 10G Gateway XB7 / XB8, Arris S33, or Netgear CM1000v2 gateway can experience it right now.

According to Jason Livingood, Comcast’s vice president of technology policy, product, and standards (and the person whose tweets put L4S on our radar in the first place), “Low Latency DOCSIS (LLD) is a key component of the Xfinity 10G Network” that incorporates L4S, and the company has learned a lot from the trials that it can use to implement tweaks next year as it prepares for an eventual launch.

To use L4S you need an OS, router, and server that supports it

The other factor helping L4S is that it’s broadly compatible with the congestion control systems in use today. Traffic using it and older protocols can coexist without making the experience worse for each other, and since it’s not an all-or-nothing proposition, it can be rolled out bit by bit. That’s much more likely to happen than a fix that would require everyone to make a major change all at the same time.

Still, there’s a lot of work that has to be done before your next Zoom call can be almost latency-free. Not every hop in the network has to support L4S for it to make a difference, but the ones that are usually the bottlenecks are. (White says that, in the US, this usually means your Wi-Fi router or the links in your “access network,” aka the equipment you use to connect to your ISP and that your ISP uses to connect to everyone else.) It also matters on the other end; the servers you’re connecting to will also have to support it.

For the most part, individual apps shouldn’t have to change too much to support it, especially if they pass off the task of dealing with networking minutiae to your device’s operating system. (Though that assumes your OS supports L4S, too, which isn’t necessarily true for everyone yet.) Companies that write their own networking code so they can get maximum performance, however, would likely have to rewrite it to support L4S — however, given the gains that are possible with it, it’d likely be worth doing.

Of course, we’ve seen other promising tech that doesn’t end up coming to fruition, and it can be tough to overcome the chicken-and-egg scenario that can exist early in the development lifecycle. Why would network operators bother putting in the work to support L4S when no internet traffic is using it? And if no network operators support it, why would the apps and services generating that traffic bother to implement it?

How can I tell if L4S will make my internet better?

That’s a great question. The biggest indicator will be how much latency you’re already experiencing in everyday life. As I mentioned before, ping is sometimes used to measure latency, but just finding your average ping won’t necessarily tell you the whole story. What really matters is what your ping is when your network is taxed and what it spikes to.

Thankfully, some speed test apps are starting to show this data. In May 2022, Ookla added a more realistic overview of latency to Speedtest, which is one of the most popular tools for seeing how fast your internet is. To see it, do a test, then tap “detailed result,” and look at the “responsiveness” section. When I did one, it told me my ping when pretty much nothing else was going on was 17, which seems pretty good. But during the download test, when I was actually using my connection, it spiked as high as 855 milliseconds — that’s almost an entire second, which would feel like an eternity if I were, say, waiting for a webpage to load, especially if it gets multiplied several times during the communication’s round trips.

(I invite anyone who’s used dial-up to tell me how soft I am and to reminisce about the days when every website took 10 seconds to load, uphill in the snow both ways.)",technology

"“We can’t let [Russian President Vladimir] Putin win. It’s in our overwhelming national interest, in the international interest of all our friends,” he said.

Weeks ago, Republicans insisted on border policy changes in exchange for backing Ukraine and Israel funding, which many of them support.

“It’s take everything we have here — their one proposal, which is extreme — or nothing,” Biden said. “They walked away.”

Progressives Democrats, including members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have strongly resisted giving away border policy — such as making it harder for migrants to claim asylum or easier for a future president to close the border — in exchange for Biden’s foreign policy agenda.

Biden did not say how the administration or congressional Democrats would proceed once the Senate vote was held, except that he would likely address reporters afterward: “We’ll know where we go from there.”

Republicans have framed their expected opposition Wednesday as a message to express how serious they are about addressing what they call a crisis at the U.S. border. Biden dismissed the effort as “playing chicken with our national security.”

Biden warned that if Congress doesn’t defend Ukraine now, the United States risked having to put boots on the ground if Putin invades a NATO country.

“If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there,” Biden said. “If “Putin attacks a NATO ally — if he keeps going and then he attacks a NATO ally — we’ve committed as a NATO member to defend every inch of NATO territory, and we’ll have something that we don’t seek and that we don’t have today.”

Biden’s remarks reflect his latest warning to get his emergency funding request for Ukraine across the finish line. On Monday, White House budget chief Shalanda Young sent congressional leaders a letter warning that inaction before the end of the year on funding threatens to “kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield.”

"Arriving way back in April 2018, ESPN Plus has cemented itself as the go-to streaming service for many sporting fans. It's the best place to stream UFC matches, along with access to MLB, MLS and more! This service also includes a full library of exclusives including 30 for 30 documentaries to keep you occupied between games. The one downside is that ESPN Plus no longer offers a free trial for new users.

Initially, new customers were able to benefit from a 7-day free trial of the sporting streaming service without dropping a dollar. While that dropped off some time ago, we'll explain any opportunities still available to try ESPN Plus for free, as well as the cheapest ways to subscribe, and the excellent value ESPN Plus bundle.

ESPN Plus free trial: why can't I get one?

From the platform’s launch in 2018 until June 2020, there was a 7-day ESPN Plus free trial available. This gave streamers still on the fence the chance to see whether the service was for them and watch live coverage of baseball, NFL football, hockey, PGA Tour Golf, and out-of-market MLS matches, as well as UFC on ESPN Plus, of course. Plus top drawer shows like Detail with host Kobe Bryant and Draft Academy.

But with ESPN's owner Disney's growing dominance within the streaming realm, alongside the company's incredible value ESPN Plus bundle (which offers ESPN Plus, Display Plus and Hulu altogether for a heavily discounted monthly fee) the generous freebie trial was sadly withdrawn in 2021.

What's the cheapest way to get ESPN Plus without a free trial?

Since dropping the ESPN Plus free trial, there's been little in the way of discounts or offers available from ESPN Plus directly or any partnering cable providers. August 2022 also saw the second price increase on the ESPN Plus cost.

Monthly, subscribers will now pay $10.99 a month, while those who subscribe for an annual subscription pay $109.99 upfront and can save 20%.

There is one other money-saving method alongside potential ESPN Plus coupon codes.

With ESPN jointly owned by Disney, the entertainment giant offers the Disney Trio bundle, which lets you get ESPN Plus, Disney Plus and Hulu for a flexible monthly sum of just $14.99. You can sign up for the great value bundle by heading to Disney Plus's website here.

What can I watch on ESPN Plus?

ESPN Plus can be best described as a supplementary streaming service on top of ESPN cable TV offering, that gives you access to extra shows, behind-the-scenes content and, most importantly, an ad-free environment to watch the content you already love.

The service gives you access to every out-of-market MLS match, alongside one NHL and MLB game per day during their respective regular seasons. You’ll also be able to watch live sporting events like golf's PGA Tour, top-tier boxing matches and a wealth of international soccer.

But perhaps the biggest draw for many will be the fact UFC on ESPN Plus. ESPN Plus has the right to live stream all UFC events in the US. Every Fight Night and numbered PPV event is now shown on ESPN Plus - although the latter requires PPV-spends, of course.

In addition to all the live sport on offer, ESPN Plus also hosts plenty of exclusive original programming too, with must-see programmes like The Fantasy Show and sports analysis series Detail alongside a wealth of additional 30 for 30 documentaries,

On top of this its also a goldmine for on-demand MMA content, including Dana White’s Contender Series, UFC Destined, and Ariel & The Bad Guy, plus classic fights and replays.",technology

I wanna puncture the illusion of events like this

just a little bit and say that,

and I don't think I'm betraying my fellow moderators here,

most of the time, moderators don't know very much at all

about the people they're talking to.

We sort of fake an interest and an enthusiasm.

All this to say, I don't have to pretend today

I'm so pleased to say I was actually watching Brit

and Zal's new show,

A Murder at the End of the World on my own

before I was asked to moderate this.

So this is coming from a very genuine place of excitement.

So please, without further ado,

welcome to the stage Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij.

[audience cheers and claps]

Welcome, welcome.

That was such a nice intro.

How do we live up to it?

I don't wanna talk too much about your last show,

The OA, but I do wanna start there

because it was meant to be five seasons.

It was infamously, unceremoniously canceled after two,

much to the outrage and profound disappointment of many,

many of us.

When I heard that the new show was a limited series,

my first thought was, well, this is uncancelable.

You can't cancel a single episode of television.

So I have to know, is that the reason the two of you

thought, we'll just make a single season of television?

You know, you're not the first person to say that.

And every time I hear it, I'm like,

I wish we had thought about it that way.

That's so clever and correct.

But I think actually this story just was a novel

with like a beginning, middle, and end.

And it was just a book.

And we asked ourselves, how long will it take to tell this?

And we were like, eight hours.

And then we were like, hmm,

budgetarily, could we make it seven?

And we did and so.

I was gonna ask why seven?

It's somewhat of an unusual number of episodes.

It was a budget thing?

Well, I think also every time we make one of these,

it sort of feels like we're writing a novel,

adapting the novel, and then making an eight hour film.

That's what each season of The OA felt like.

So by the time we were doing it for the third time

with A Murder at the End of the World,

we were like, you know, if we just shave off an hour,

we'll make it a lot easier on ourselves.

So maybe the next thing we make will be three hours

and then two hours, and then we'll just be right back at

making feature films again, yeah.

Can you, for the audience very briefly sum up

what the show is, what it's about, what you're going for,

Zal maybe you want to take this one?

Sure, A Murder at the End of the World,

is about a tech billionaire and his wife

who decide to host a retreat of world luminaries.

And they invite our hero, Darby Hart, who is a 24-year-old

freshly minted author whose book isn't that successful.

So she doesn't know why she's invite.

And she's invited to a remote hotel

these billionaires have just built in Iceland.

And then, you know, shit happens.

Bad shit, good shit.

[everyone chuckles]

Sort of murders in confined spaces,

whether it's a house or in this case a hotel.

I mean, there's a storied tradition of this.

It's a classic of the genre.

And I, how much of making the show was wanting

to participate in that tradition.

Try your own version of a murder mystery, a who done it.

And did you study past examples in the work,

the lead up to making it?

We did, we did, we watched a lot of Gosford Park.

We watched Gosford Park multiple times.

Actually, Zal one day came into our writer's room,

which is really just like the bedroom

or a spare room of whatever house we're in.

And he had been doing some research on the

whodunit as a genre.

And he came in and he was like, you know,

the whodunit came to popularity for the first time

between the first and the second World War,

which was another time when I think everyone was kind

of looking around and being like, okay, who done it?

Like, how did we get here?

And who's to blame?

Who's responsible for this, you know,

situation we're finding ourselves in.

And I think it felt to both of us, like this is,

we're in another era where things are very complicated

and we're up against these big overwhelming forces,

whether that's the climate crisis

or the unravel of democracy or whatever it is,

it feels like the forces are huge

and that we're kind of all looking around

and being like, okay, who done it?

How did we get here?

And how do we, how do we find our way out of this?

So that was sort of the beginning

of thinking about the genre.

And it was too tempting because

the old English manor house

where these stories were set

and a sort of billionaire's retreat, it's just too easy

to sort of, you know, supplant one with the other.

It just felt like such a natural fit.

[Jason] Wait, say more, why?

What was so easy about that?

Well, you know, both have a group of interesting

and strange characters coming together.

Both have a sort of natural leader, you know,

the guy who owns the house.

Both are a seat of power, representative of a seat

of power at the time.

Yeah, exactly, yeah.

What other trope were there?

Were, were you conscious of other tropes

you were playing with, subverting?

Well, what happens, you know, I mean,

I guess sometimes it's the audacity of me and Brit

and what we should be sort of punished

or praised for, which is that we think

that we can change a genre, you know,

because we find certain genres very problematic.

Like Brit one day, you know, was just like,

why does every murder mystery have to start

with a dead woman, half clothed, blood somewhere?

And why does that image system power the whole narrative?

And, you know, you say it much better, so you should say it.

No, I mean, at Twin Peaks, for instance, as a series,

I love, like, love that series

and I found myself watching it again one day

and being like, oh, could you make this if like the image

in the sky was a Larry Palmer, like, would you be as drawn

to like solving a mystery that was of a young man?

Like, not exactly.

There's something about the dead woman

that has a sort of dark erotic charge

that murder mysteries have been trafficking in for forever.

And so I think for us, the challenge was like, okay,

can we take that young woman and sort of stand her up

and clean the blood off of her?

And can she solve the crime?

And not with a badge or the authority of gender or her age,

but just because she authorizes herself to do it

as a kind of citizen detective.

And I think if we'd been making it even, you know, five,

10 years ago or something

that would've felt very tongue in cheek, sort

of Nancy Drew style murder mystery.

But where amateur sleuthing is right now

and where the sort of like hive mind

of the internet is right now,

a young woman could become a credible detective

and really have logged her 10,000 hours on the internet

solving cold cases with other amateur sleuths.

And so it felt like a character we could finally write

and pull off where it would actually be very serious,

or we could get the audience to take her seriously

if we could figure out how to write our way

around the sort of tent poles of the genre

as Zal was talking about.

I do want to keep talking about Darby

and citizen detection, but your answer there reminded me,

and we talked a little bit about this backstage

of your appearance on an episode

of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast,

Revisionist History a season or two ago.

It was a three part series on the Disney movie,

A Little Mermaid,

and he had Brit on as sort of an expert screenwriter,

which she is, and asked or gave her homework

and said, can you please rewrite the ending

of The Little Mermaid in a way that might,

well, I don't know, why don't you tell us

what you understood the assignment to be?

Well, he called me one day because he had,

he was having a daughter

and he was watching animations, you know,

films that he might share with his daughter.

And he watched The Little Mermaid and was outraged.

And he called me just screaming.

He was like, this is ridiculous.

I mean, she doesn't even do anything.

She has no agency.

She solves nothing, at the end she's like cowering

at the bottom of like a tidal pool.

And he was very upset and he was like,

is there a way to rewrite this story that,

you know, maintains some of the things

that we love about it, but maybe gives some,

you know, power and agency back

to the Little Mermaid herself.

And maybe also, and this was the twist I pulled on him

as I called him back three days later.

And I was like, what if Ursula isn't really the villain?

And he was like, oooooh.

And then I wrote some stuff up and I sent it to him

and he was like, this is so much fun.

I'm gonna spend three episodes on it

and I'm gonna call Jodie Foster

and see if she wants to come play the Little Mermaid.

[Jason] You made that call.

He made that call.

[Jason] Oh, he made that call, right?

Yeah.

And she came and she did it.

And Glen Close was Ursula

and we had a ball, we even got Zal to come

into the recording booth

and play one of the characters, which,

[Jason] Who did you play?

[Zal] No, I was awful.

The priest, who.

Brit's laughing at Malcolm

and her laughing at me trying to do one line,

and then I realized like

how intense it is the Brit acts in our projects

and that I'd never had enough empathy for that.

This raises so many questions for me about the purpose

of stories and sort to be totally honest

before that episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast,

I was sort of the opinion that it doesn't matter

what the ending is, we're all intelligent consumers of art.

We could separate this is a story versus like,

this is the way I should live my life.

Right?

But something about that episode kind of convinced you,

but maybe the endings of these stories do mean,

and maybe we, we do struggle to separate out like,

what's it mean that The Little Mermaid ended

up at the bottom, whatever.

Like it's think about, tell me how you think about

the moral, I guess of stories?

Do they need to end the right way?

Do they need to end in a way that's morally edifying

or is that cheap?

Are we being talked down to, or condescended

to if the ending is politically correct,

for lack of a better term?

Well, I mean I think all endings are political,

all movies, all stories are political, all of them.

There's no way out of it.

And it's who is controlling those politics.

Or, and also I think to add to that, it's, I think stories

often put parameters around what we're capable of imagining

and who we're capable of having empathy with,

which is why it's so nice to be alive in a time when

technology's reached a place

where filmmaking is accessible to more people

and a lot of different kinds of storytellers, us included,

are finding our way into the writer and director's chair

'cause it just changes the stories that are out there.

But, you know, you and I were talking about

science fiction earlier.

There was a little boy who was 10 years old

who read a graphic novel in the sixties,

in the 1960s that featured lasers,

which was like such a far out idea.

That little boy grew up,

and when he was in his fifties, he became the person

who invented the laser.

And I think that that, you know,

sometimes science fiction is prescient

and it's foreseeing something that's coming,

but sometimes science fiction is calling into being

something that doesn't exist.

And so I think for the people who make science fiction

or tell these kind of stories, there's actually,

I don't know if it's a moral imperative,

but it's a real question of what kind

of worlds do you want to build

because it does affect sort of the way in which we imagine

or what we all think is possible

or a future we could step into.

I love that.

Do you, both of you consider yourself

science fiction practitioners?

Are you in the genre, are you outside?

Where, how do you think of yourself in relation to sci-fi?

Before we answer that very good question

I just wanna say that I think that on

what you were asking earlier,

I think the most radical thing I've experienced

in my lifetime is not a technological leap.

It's not the internet or a driverless car,

which I was in today, coming here.

Those are, you know, gonna change our lives.

But I think the most radical thing

that's happened in my lifetime

is that women are writing and directing stories

and that it's happening on such a mass level.

[audience clapping and cheering]

I'm not even getting, like, I saw Anatomy of a Fall.

Have you guys seen Anatomy of a Fall yet?

You have to go see it if you haven't seen it.

And I walked out and I realized like, oh,

I will now see women on the streets, Brit, who I work with,

I will just see the world differently

because I saw this movie

and, you know, this is a radical move.

And I think it's such an honor for me to get to work

with Brit because, you know,

A Murder at the End of the World, is coming out right now

and Brit directed chapters five and six.

Five comes out today and six comes out next week.

And I just noticed the difference when Brit's working

with Emma, when Brit's writing these stories

and then directing them.

And there's such a difference.

And I think that is the thing

that is the thing that's gonna change our lives.

[Jason] What is the difference?

Can you say a bit more about that?

I'll use Anatomy of a Fall

'cause it's easier to talk about.

I think it's just,

I'd never seen a woman like that on screen before.

And as Brit just said, once you see it,

once someone lives to tell it,

like has the skills to put that on screen

and move us in the way that those filmmakers

and actors did, then all of a sudden

the limitations of your imagination change.

Okay, back to science fiction are you,

fabulous answer by the way,

are you a sci-fi writer?

Are both of you?

Yes, yes, I think we are

sometimes science fiction writers.

I mean, something else I think a lot about is an expression

that I heard Adrian Marie Brown use once.

She's an activist and a writer who I admire.

And she, she wrote a book called Pleasure Activism.

But she had talked about once the idea

of resistance fiction.

And I really like that expression

because I, she sort of described it as

every story is either maintaining the status quo

or it's working against the status quo

and trying to build something different.

And I think that all of our stories in one way

or another have that energy in them,

maybe just 'cause of who we are as people

and as Zal was saying earlier,

because every story by nature of

who is the storyteller is political.

And sometimes I think that takes a science fiction bend,

you know, like in The OA,

which you could describe a science fiction or low fantasy

or just really fucking weird and far out.

But yeah, I think all of the ideas behind this stuff

are an attempt of people who have traditionally

in storytelling been in the margins,

trying to figure out how to imagine a world

that they can really not only survive in, but thrive in.

And what might that look like

and how to articulate the experience of being

in the world that we're in now.

What do you, what would you say Zal though?

[Zal] Yeah, I think so, yeah.

Brit earlier used the word prescient

and we have to talk about AI in the show.

AI plays a fairly central role.

There's an AI assistant kind of in the walls of the hotel

made by the tech billionaire

who's presiding over this retreat.

This was written as I understand it

what, four years ago you said?

In the first episode,

the AI is asked to, I think if I have this right,

write Harry Potter in the style of Ernest Hemingway.

And that's very familiar to us now

because ChatGPT can do that in a second.

But when you wrote that, where,

what were you basing that on?

Because now it feels extremely prescient.

When we would give people early drafts of the script

or like early stuff, they'd be like,

are you sure you wanna do AI?

Isn't that just a Hollywood thing?

And there's like stuff talking about large language models

and people would be like, ah, cross that out.

That's so confusing.

Nobody caress, what does this mean?

And we really fought to keep it in that space.

And then like lo and behold, as we were shooting

and then as you know, while we were writing,

actually a friend of ours helped us get early access

to ChatGPT-3 an early beta version.

And we played around with that a bit as we were,

you know, coming up with Ray.

But then it was interesting to see like, as we were editing

as we, everything just sort of kind of came to pass.

So now a lot of what felt like science fiction near future,

by the time the story came into the world is

just where we're at.

Did that excite you guys?

Were you worried that maybe you got it slightly wrong

or were you pretty comfortable?

Well this, you know, the actor's strike was happening

and so the studio called us and said,

we're not gonna release the show.

Do you guys want January, November?

We said November.

By January it'll be like really passe, so.

[audience chuckles]

Probably true.

Let's talk a little bit more about Darby the protagonist.

She is a hacker and a writer

and sort of the perennial challenge

of both of those professions on screen

is that it's very hard to dramatize basically typing.

I mean, what these people do for a living is at a computer,

whether you're writing or you're coding.

Did you think about the challenges

of having a main character who really doesn't,

in one sense do a lot?

I'm gonna let Zal take this one

'cause he fought actually very hard on our screen

work throughout the entire.

Yeah, it was very hard to fight Disney legal

on using just like, you know, Google or Facebook

or Reddit or any of those things.

So we did it and it's there

and we wanted to use it as realistically as possible.

But yeah, I disagree that it's boring.

Everyone always says that it's boring.

But I think, you know, we have a six minute scene

where Bill and Darby are meeting each other

for the first time and 90% of that scene

happens over the computer, they can't see each other,

and then at the end they see each other.

And I love it.

So we spend our lives in front of computers

and screens, so we should be able to figure out

how to dramatize that.

It's harder.

But I think also what Zal was really careful with,

you know, in building that scene

was making a narrative inside it.

So like every beat of it, you know,

Darby's wanting something and tries something

and then doesn't get it and then has to try something else

and you're watching it play out on a screen,

but each, each beat of what's happening on screen

has a narrative thrust

and there's a beginning, middle, and end and a reversal.

And so I think that hopefully holds the moments

and makes them compelling.

And to be fair, they're both citizen detectives,

so they are going out into the world

and doing things as well.

And, that makes me want to ask,

do you think as writers it is important

to also go out in the world and do things?

And I ask somewhat selfishly

because as an editor of a magazine,

I sometimes worry that writers don't do that enough

and they, they do just stay at home

in front of their computers

and aren't experiencing the world enough.

So are you guys out and about

or are you very kind of computer bound as people?

Brit gives me this grin when she wants

to throw all the hard questions my way.

[everyone chuckles]

Yeah, I mean, I think we have to fight

to be out and about more.

When we were younger, we just did it.

It was just a lot easier to go do wild things

and then come back and try to form a story from it

or form a story and then try to go do something wild

to sort of play it out.

But yeah, I'm excited to go forth into the world this,

we're done with this story and anything is possible

and the world is changing constantly.

So it's a good time to go and explore.

I think it's also part of the love affair

between Bill and Darby.

And what makes it an interesting romance

is that she grew up as the coroner's daughter.

She was an outcast in school.

Like she came into her algebra class

smelling of formaldehyde, you know, she's weird,

but she finds him on the internet

and they begin this courtship

and they're solving these cases and it's so intoxicating

and Darby would be happy to keep it there, you know,

like she's a girl who's kind of living from here up

like a lot of us are these days we're just like all here.

And then, you know, they stumble across this important piece

of evidence and Bill's like, I'm gonna drive a state away.

I'm gonna pick you up.

Like, let's get in the car, let's go solve this thing.

Let's drive across the country.

And Darby closes her laptop

because the idea of, you know,

meeting Bill IRL like in the flesh

and contending with the awkwardness of bodies

and the strangeness of actually falling in love

with someone in real time is so terrifying to her

as I think it's kind of becoming terrifying

for all of us the more we live our lives online, you know,

to risk vulnerability and stuff in person.

But I think what happens between the two of them

as they're on the road is like really heartening.

And we felt it as a crew and a cast shooting it.

Like in the end we kind of pared down

and we were just like 20 of us in the desert

shooting this story as they fell in love.

And you got back to sort of the essence of filmmaking,

a little stripped bare of all the pomp and circumstance

and just people like sweating it out

and finding it together in these locations.

And there was something very beautiful about that adventure.

Zal you mentioned earlier that Brit

also acts in this show.

So between the two of you,

I mean you pretty much do everything you can do.

You write it, you direct it, you produce it, you act in it.

Is that auteurism, is that an obnoxious word?

Are you both auteurs of the silver screen?

Don't look at Zal, this is a question.

[Brit] This for me, but I thought it was for him.

We're doing the thing where you were

giving him the hard question.

Let's see what he says when I don't look.

[Jason] We'll start with Brit.

Are you an auteur?

I, can I, okay, the honest answer,

I think I've always found the auteur thing a little weird.

I mean, I don't know, filmmaking is so,

is inherently a choral enterprise, you know,

if you wanna take all the credit for something,

write a novel or paint a painting, you know,

I think one of the things that's beautiful

about filmmaking is that

when you have really great collaborators, you know,

like our production designer, Alex DiGerlando,

our cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen,

costume designer, Megan Gray,

like every one of them is such a gifted artist.

And you know, we write the script

and we come up with a story and we all get together.

And then to watch the ways in which they carve the story

deeper through the acumen of their craft, it's dazzling.

It's like the most, it's like when you were a kid

in the sandbox and you found other kids that wanted

to build an imagined world with you.

It's an incredible collaborative experience.

So I guess for me, I kind of,

I sometimes just a little bit raise my eyebrows

at the word auteur, 'cause I'm like,

what does that really mean?

What about the hundreds of people

that come together to make this stuff, yeah.

[Jason] Zal, do you sort of feel the same way?

Yeah, I mean, we always put the story,

people ask us if we fight in our creative collaboration

and we don't because we always put the story first.

And I think the collaborators that we work with

also put the story first.

So it's easy when you put the story

above your own anything else.

And then I think as a result,

because of the whole conversation we've been having,

the kinds of stories we're trying to tell

and trying to reimagine a genre which is really audacious,

maybe a dumb thing to do,

it naturally gives our work a certain feeling and quality.

So maybe the works have a similar feeling,

but I don't think that comes from our authorship.

It comes from the way we're dreaming.

Which I guess is a kind of authorship now

that I hear you say it, but yeah.

[Jason] Wait, say, say a little bit more about that.

Well, I think I, as I'm hearing him say it like

that is a kind of authorship.

I think that there's, Zal and I have been telling stories

together since we met when we were teenagers in college.

So there is some space that is between the two of us

that we go into all the time and build worlds in together.

And maybe because as Zal's saying,

a lot of that involves taking genres

and turning them on their heads.

There is a kind of, that has some sort of flavor

or I guess signature maybe.

The last thing I wanna talk about is spoilers

in the lead up to this panel, I must have been asked,

you know, three times not to spoil anything.

And I wouldn't dream of it.

It would be a betrayal of you and the audience.

But intellectually, I always think why do we care

so much about spoilers?

I mean, emotionally, I understand,

but we know the ending of Romeo and Juliet

and because we know the ending,

we're free to appreciate the plot and the turns

and the twists and the storytelling.

So if I knew the end of this show,

which is a murder mystery,

and knowing the end is probably a big deal,

would I appreciate it more?

Would I take more pleasure in the beats of the storytelling?

And I'm curious how the two of you, as the people

who wrote it, feel about spoilers.

[Zal] Have you ever been to a film festival?

[Jason] No.

Well, the most radical thing for me when I went

to Sundance for the first time

was to watch these other movies,

and I realized that I'd almost never seen a movie on the big

screen where I hadn't bought into it.

Like they hadn't had to sell me most of the plot

in order to get me to go to the movie.

And they do all this marketing and testing

and they get the colors right

and all this stuff to sort of seduce me.

And so when you watch a movie

and you don't know anything about it,

it is the most magical feeling.

So I think that, yeah, there's something so cool about,

you know, we really wanted to do that with OA,

especially this idea that streaming had just started

and Netflix, like you just press play

and you just, we wanted to take people

on the wildest ride in which you couldn't predict things.

So I think sometimes, but yeah, you know,

when you know the ending, it's still good.

That said, I mean, I do think we also try

to construct stories so that you can watch the ending

and then when you go back to the beginning

you see all kinds of things in it

that you didn't see before.

And I think that wasn't possible before

I mean, traditional television was made kind

of like in a factory model.

Like someone's, you know, writing chapter five

while someone else is shooting chapter one

and you're playing a kind of leapfrog to get to the end.

And you often don't know the ending

as you once as you're writing the beginning.

But in what we've been doing

or what really internet streaming storytelling has allowed,

I don't even think it is television anymore,

is that we write everything up front, you know,

and then so it exists as a whole.

And when we get to the ending of writing,

we always go back to the beginning and rewrite the beginning

because you've learned things along the way.

So hopefully, and you can call me and tell me if it's true

when you get to the end,

you can let me know if chapter one still

withstands the scrutiny of chapter seven.

Perfect note to go out on.

And please thank Brit and Zal again.

Thank you guys, thank you.

"It’s official: Sam Altman is, once again, the CEO of OpenAI. How did the world’s hottest generative AI company go through three CEOs in under a week and end up with the same one it had at the start? This is what we know so far.

On November 17th, OpenAI’s board abruptly announced that co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was out, effective immediately. After weekend talks to restore Sam Altman to his post fell apart, former Twitch boss Emmett Shear was announced as the interim CEO of OpenAI. Then hundreds of OpenAI employees — including former interim CEO Mira Murati and (now-former) board member Ilya Sutskever — signed a letter saying they would leave the company for jobs at Microsoft unless Altman is reinstated.

After some negotiations, Altman has returned, along with president Greg Brockman, while Murati is returning to her role as the company’s CTO. The deal also includes a new set of board members, which now will include representation from Microsoft.",technology
"Transcript

I'm Sophie Liard,

and today I've been challenged

to break down gift wrapping into 11 levels of complexity.

[energetic music]

As we go through these levels,

just remember this is gonna take some practice,

so don't give up.

As a disclaimer, this is my interpretation of the challenge.

Level one, box and bow.

We're gonna have three versions of this level.

We're starting with the box and bow

because it's the easiest one to master.

It's also probably the one that people would use the most.

So a box is the same measurement every time.

The paper should go just over halfway up the side

and then cover the top of the gift,

and that's how you would measure.

And this applies to all sizes.

I don't worry about whether my scissors

are cutting a straight line or not.

I will just tidy it up

by folding the edge of the paper over

before I start wrapping.

Just straightens everything out.

You're just going to cover the box from left to right.

Over the top, just a little bit of overlap.

Add a piece of tape here.

Fold the sides in

until you get to your last side of the box.

For a box, I'm just happy to use standard tape.

So when you're doing a ribbon,

you have one long side and one short side

so make sure you measure it correctly...

[jazzy music]

without cutting the roll first.

[jazzy music]

So here's another method.

It'll measure exactly the same,

but it will be a different technique on the side.

Tidy up by folding the edge of the paper over.

Left fold, right fold, tape.

And then when you get to the side,

you're going to fold a diagonal line

and then crease your sides

and that would make your box look super, super sharp.

Let's just make sure your paper really hits the side.

And the same when you're going in now.

You're gonna take the paper right into the box

before you crease.

Fold up, tape.

You can decorate it with a nice bow.

It feels natural for me to hold it top corner,

short side holding with my thumb.

You're gonna go over one corner, then under the next,

then over the next corner, then under the next.

And that should bring you back to the middle.

Another thing that helps with bows

is if you keep your loops really small,

then you can always make them bigger afterwards.

[upbeat music]

This is like when you found that one present,

you haven't wrapped and you've got one tiny bit

of paper left and it doesn't fit.

And it's not the neatest of wraps,

but it's that or go to the shop, so we will do this.

You're just gonna turn it on an angle.

[jazzy music]

And then it should fit.

It's just a great way

if you've just got a little bit of paper left

and you've still got a gift left,

it's quite likely that a box will fit

if you turn it at a diagonal.

Next up, level two, sweater.

The difference with dealing with a box versus a sweater

is that your box has nice, flat, hard sides

that we don't have on clothing.

So to fold the sweater, you're gonna fold in the sides,

and fold down the arms, and then fold the bottom up,

and then fold the top.

Folding with tissue is my absolute fav.

If the tissue paper's too small, it doesn't matter,

you just layer it across on the table,

overlap your second piece,

and it will still wrap in exactly the same way.

What you're gonna do first

is just fold the paper over the sweater

and then tuck in each of the ends into the sweater.

Level three, the book.

So the books are a higher level

because you can do quite complex wraps with them

just purely because of the shape.

They're kind of a box, but they're very flat.

We're gonna have three versions of this level.

The paper should go just over halfway up the sides.

I just measure it by lining it up with the side of the book.

It's gonna come right over the book like this.

So after we've measured out the paper,

the first fold is to make your card slot.

It's essentially just quite a big pleat,

and really from there on, you can just wrap your book

as we've taught you in level one.

Right fold, left fold, add a piece of tape,

fold down, fold up, card slot,

and you can decorate it with a nice bow.

[scissors snipping]

[jazzy music]

With the second book wrap,

we've changed the shape of the card slot.

Same kind of measurement as before.

You're going to fold a diagonal line

and then fold up.

The best paper to use,

especially if you're starting,

get some wrapping paper that has a real abstract pattern on

and that way you are not gonna have to

worry about whether the lines are straight.

This is the front of the gift,

so you wanna put the bottom down first

because then from the top, this bit will sit that way.

And if you do it the other way,

you'll be able to see it from the top.

The detail. My boss always you say, Retail is detail.

And then use a corner bow,

which will sit flush against the shape of your card slot

and just all ties in really nicely.

Pleating can go many places.

You can make your pleats any width you like.

It's not quite the right size,

and you can open your paper back up and replete.

I mean I do that all the time.

If you are just starting with pleating,

I would recommend starting with vertical pleats

and practicing with those.

And then you can change to diagonal pleats,

which are really fun.

It's nice to keep your pleats nice and tight.

I'll just turn it over.

We don't wanna see the tapes,

we don't want tape on our beautiful pleats,

so we use double sided, so it's hidden underneath the wrap.

Tape back down, and then you wrap the sides.

Level four, stocking stuffers.

So things that work really good for the gift wrap method

is items like this, so they've got shape here,

and then a shape here.

I would definitely be wrapping little cuddly toys in there

just because look, they're just an awkward shape.

So you're gonna fold the paper into thirds.

And to measure it,

just make sure your paper covers the gift

that you're wanting to put in the bag.

We use double-sided tape.

Then you're gonna make the bottom of the bag

by folding the paper up

and then pushing in the sides.

Tape, then you're gonna move to the sides of the bag.

You are gonna fold those in

so they meet the corners of the bottom.

[jazzy music]

Then you are gonna fold it all out.

And making sure you put the gift in the bag,

you can then start to close your bag up.

You're going to fold a diagonal right and then left,

[jazzy music]

and you can decorate it with a nice bow.

Tape here. So multiple items, cuddly toys, awkward shapes.

Also tiny things like cosmetics,

they're also really, really difficult to wrap.

You can make a little gift bag

and put all three in the gift bag as well.

Level five, cubes.

So a cube, all the sides are the same area.

With the boxes that we did at level one,

there was always one side shorter than the other,

so it was a slightly different type of wrap.

If you were going to wrap your cube with a standard wrap,

then you would absolutely use

the same measurements as a box,

which we showed you in level one.

But for the top of the box, we will need some extra paper.

So we've just cut a little bit extra for the top of the box.

Create your shapes by folding the paper in to the middle.

[light airy music]

Start with one side, you're gonna fold up.

You'll do this for all four sides.

You just go round your cube and folding into the middle,

fold into the middle,

and it just gives you this beautiful, kind of,

like a fire swirling shape on top of the cube

that's perfectly symmetrical.

Level six, box with no tape.

To start with the no tape method,

you do need to get the right measurements,

and this time you are gonna measure on a diagonal

and make sure the corners go over

the top of the box on both sides.

It's definitely easier to use a thinner paper,

so shop bow paper.

You need a lot of flexibility in it.

What can go wrong is so many things.

For me personally, it's usually the measurements.

If you've got the measurement just too wrong,

not just slightly wrong, that's absolutely fine,

but if you've got a massively wrong measurement of paper,

it will make the wrap so much harder.

You're gonna start with one corner

and just make sure it comes over the box

and it just hits those top two corners.

And then to start the sides,

you're going to run your nail from the box all the way out.

And this is just to give the paper some creasing

and that will make it a lot easier

for you to then do your next fold.

And the next fold, you're then going to fold the sides in

and fold your next corner over the box.

And you're gonna repeat this on the following corner

until you get to your last side of the box.

Level seven, cookie tin.

This will work for all cylinders, this level.

Think about pillar candles maybe,

anything that's that type of shape.

You've got a cylinder and then a flat top and a flat bottom.

So you're gonna measure.

The paper should go just over halfway up the sides.

Tape. My tip to make sure

all your pleats are the same size

is just to use your finger in between each pleat

when you are pulling the paper towards the center.

Just remember you are repeating the action.

Turn your shape, repeat,

but use your finger to get the pleat the right size.

If you want a bigger pleat,

then you're gonna put two fingers down.

If you want even bigger, you can put three.

It'll just help you get really even sized pleats

all the way round.

Once you've done your first one,

just repeat it on the next one, repeat on the next one,

and you'll get it beautifully the same

until you get to the end.

Level eight, the candle.

This is just fun, yeah?

And quite often candles have got funny lids

or they're kind of going out in a funnel type shape.

So this is just a great way to wrap it up

and make it look really fun.

We've got the shape that we need.

Start with one side and then fold the bottom up.

The tricky part is definitely cutting the corners

so you get the right shape

to be able to tie the ends with your ribbon.

I quite like to class myself as a home gift wrapper,

so kind of like a home baker.

Everything with gift wrapping can be trial and error,

can be practice, and you can start again.

Level nine, the wine bottle.

I feel like with the wine bottle,

I mean we give wine as a gift so often,

there's no way to wrap this

without knowing we're taking wine.

So, I tend to encourage people just to wrap it

as the wine bottle.

Tissue paper is the easiest to use

when doing the wine bottle,

and I would highly recommend using it.

I held onto it.

I mean you could, at some point, tape it, I guess,

but it's nice to keep your pleats nice and tight,

and even if it does fall, it's easy to put back together.

That's the beauty of tissue paper.

We're using a bow, we're using pleat,

so there is some technique involved

and it, let's face it, it's a very odd shape,

but it's a gift that's given often.

So, it deserves a little wrap.

Level 10, soccer ball.

I just realized how I'd never say that word.

Level 10, football.

Yeah, this was super unusual

and I appreciated the challenge on this one.

You've not only got a sphere,

but you've got it in a triangle box.

Whoever designed this

obviously didn't want it to be gift wrapped.

So it's a slight variation on the gift bag, this level.

It just has a little bit different finish.

So, you're gonna fold the paper into thirds.

Then, you're gonna make the bottom of the bag

by folding the paper up,

making sure you put the gift in the bag.

The way we turned it on its side,

it's just a completely different shape,

but the premise is the same.

Level 11, tennis racket.

I love a challenge.

And I thought, Okay, so what shapes have we got?

So what we do is we break down the tennis racket

into different shapes.

And what we've got is

the top of the tennis racket with the strings,

which is a round shape.

And then we've got the bottom,

which is kind of like a pole I would say.

What I would think about is wrapping the top half first

and then moving on to the bottom half using the same paper,

but two separate sheets,

and then bringing it together.

We actually pleated the top half of the racket,

which I thought looked very lovely.

And then we brought the paper down to the bottom.

And then we used part of the gift bag method

to be able to wrap the handle of the tennis racket

because actually the handle

isn't quite a straightforward shape,

neither round or has sides.

So the gift bag method was a really good one,

and then we just were able to connect them together.

I think it just turned out really nice.

I hope that anyone who gets all the way to level 11,

I really hope that you take away the repetitive techniques

that you can use for the different shapes,

and that you can see when you pick up your next gift,

what technique you can match to wrap that gift.

And if you don't get it first time

or you don't get it second, third, or fourth time,

know that that's happened to me too

and practice makes perfect.

Thank you so much for watching.",technology
"“The Finals is a game show at heart; it’s not a battle royale or a military sim.”

That’s Gustav Tilleby, creative director of The Finals, describing a new shooter from former Battlefield developers that’s launching today — a surprise shadow drop during The Game Awards. Tilleby and the team at Embark Studios have spent nearly five years painstakingly developing server-side destruction to create something truly unique. The entire environment is destructible, making The Finals feel like a first-person shooter like no other.

In The Finals, you play in teams of three, competing in a game show-like arena where you’ll collect cash and bank it to win. There are three different classes (light, medium, and heavy), all with different weapons and abilities. That all sounds like your typical arena shooter. But what sets The Finals apart is the ability to crash through buildings, blow things up with canisters, and witness UFO invasions, orbital lasers, or ramped-up destruction modes mid-game.

After playing the open beta alongside 7.5 million others, I haven’t been this excited about a first-person shooter since I played the early versions of PUBG. The Finals has the potential to shake up a formula that has gotten stale, and perhaps even boring, in recent years.

“From the very beginning, we said that if we’re going to make a shooter, it needs to be different; it needs to be something that nobody else is doing,” says Tilleby in an interview with The Verge. “I personally love systemic game design where you give the players tools and it’s really up to them to use them.”

A fully destructive world means the tactics of a usual shooter like lanes and choke points go out the window. You can be standing in a hallway in The Finals waiting for an enemy, and then, the next minute, the floor underneath you is disappearing. You can be great at aiming, but in The Finals, you need to be great at adapting and using the environment to your advantage.

“It’s almost a childhood fantasy of mine where you can play in a game where you can go into every single building, every single room, and pick up every object and destroy everything,” says Tilleby. “It’s really cool that we actually managed to build it. It’s not been easy to do.”

Server-side movement is the key component of the destruction inside The Finals. In typical shooters, the elements that move inside the game and the physics engines all run on your console or PC, with movement syncing up to a server to be distributed to other players so everyone is experiencing the same multiplayer interactions. There’s always the chance here of desync, where the server and client hitboxes aren’t fully in sync and you end up with situations where you thought your aim was perfect but the bullets didn’t register.

Embark Studios decided to shift all of this onto the server. That doesn’t mean you’re streaming a cloud game; it just means the movement, destruction, and physics engines don’t run on your PC or console at all. Instead, it’s all part of network data, so moving platforms, debris piles, and all in-game movement syncs that way instead.

“So the way our model works is that as much as possible, where we can, we sort of cheat a little,” admitted Arvid Burstrom, technical animator at Embark Studios, in a podcast earlier this year. “We run this thin prediction wrapper on top of our gameplay and then we try and minimize the amount of prediction we have as much as possible so we can stay true to what the server is saying.”

It has taken years of testing and tweaking to perfect the prediction model, and even the movement in a beta earlier this year felt a little too floaty. In the early days of testing in 2021, the team discovered a series of amusing bugs, including buildings that would multiply and then collapse on top of each other and walls that had a mind of their own. Many of the object interactions and destruction elements you see in the game today were first built years ago but have been improved to the point where everyone gets to experience them now.

All of this focus on destruction has also changed how the team designs maps. “Working on other projects before, you can easily hide things or have things as backdrops because you know people will never be able to go there. Now, we can’t just create this empty space because we know people will be able to destroy it,” explains Joakim Stigsson, a senior environment artist for The Finals, in an interview with The Verge.

That has meant designing around structural integrity, considering the amount of beams, pillars, and other elements of a building that players can use to weaken a building and ultimately destroy it.

“We play test our game more or less every day,” says Stigsson. “When we’re designing the map, together with the level designers, we are playing and iterating on the maps to see if it hits the design goals we set out at the beginning.”

One of those goals was to vary the maps that are available in The Finals. “A huge addition for launch is Las Vegas,” reveals Tilleby. “It’s a bit different from the ones we’ve done so far. It has really big interconnected interiors, and it’s even leaning even more into destruction and that type of gameplay.”

The Las Vegas map even has a UFO invasion event that can appear mid-game, similar to the modifiers that suddenly appear to kick off a low-gravity mode or even more destruction damage. The alien invasion mode will include a flying saucer that can tractor beam the map and pull stuff up into the air to create an even more chaotic environment for players to fight in.

You can imagine the team will add more of these events in the future. “There are tons of ideas of where to take it next. Wind systems and weather are definitely things that are on the drawing board and that we might do sometime in the future,” says Tilleby. “I personally want to expand on features that can create knock-on effects and chain effects and so on; that’s something that would be very interesting and expand on the experience of playing the game.”

Early work on the destruction elements of The Finals.

If you played last month’s open beta, there are some new abilities to play with today. There’s a new vanishing bomb, which sounds like it’s going to be very useful for stealth play. “It’s similar to the stealth ability, but it affects all players that are in a given range so you can vanish your whole team for a short while and reposition,” says Tilleby. Throwing knives are also now part of the game, giving you some options for a ranged attack.

The first season of The Finals kicks off today, with a 12-level battle pass that includes 96 rewards. You’ll need to unlock the competitive side of the game, and the entire battle pass should take around 40 hours to complete for the average player.

The Finals is undoubtedly an exciting release for first-person shooter fans, but it now has to live up to the hype and perform the delicate balancing act of being a free-to-play live-service game. These types of games are difficult for studios to maintain, as we’ve seen recently from Destiny 2 developer Bungie.

The delicate balance involves keeping the game fresh with regular updates, a solid progression system, player rewards, and how and when paid cosmetics are available. On top of all of that, there’s the constant cat-and-mouse game against cheaters or the first-person shooter debate about cross-play, skill-based matchmaking, and how much aim assist to give console players. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a lot.

The Finals is launching on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC (Steam), with cross-play only enabled if you actively choose to. That allows console and PC players to avoid each other and spare most of the arguments about cross-play. Mouse and keyboard players will likely have an advantage in The Finals anyway simply because there’s a lot riding on your ability to respond quickly to environment changes and movement.

The matchmaking in The Finals should be a little bit more relaxed than something like Call of Duty simply because the skill gap will be different than who can hit their headshots. There are so many more variables here with the environment, player abilities, and movement that the best players will be the ones who can master the chaos and adapt. “We’ve seen that in our internal play tests; it’s not necessarily the people who are best at aiming that come out on top,” says Stigsson. “I’m not the best player in the house, but I’ve managed to win tournaments internally in testing.”",technology
"In his most in-depth public remarks in years, Biden sat down for a two-part interview with musician Moby that was released Friday to discuss Republican attacks. The interview was recorded at the president’s son’s studio in San Francisco but the exact timing of its recording was not made clear. Biden and Moby have a shared history — the two met while recovering from addiction and the musician has attended Biden’s art shows.

Hunter Biden’s comments Friday mirror those of his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, who said Thursday that ""[after] five years of investigating with no new evidence — and two years after Hunter paid his taxes in full — the U.S. Attorney has piled on nine new charges when he had agreed just months ago to resolve this matter with a pair of misdemeanors.”

The charges come amid an effort by House Republicans to link President Joe Biden to his son’s business dealings as part of an impeachment inquiry, though the inquiry has produced no evidence that Joe Biden took any actions as president or vice president to corruptly enrich his family.

In the podcast Friday, the president’s son said he felt sorry for Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), two of Hunter Biden’s most aggressive pursuers on Capitol Hill, and called them “not healthy people.”

In July, Greene held up posters with censored and explicit images of Hunter Biden during an Oversight Committee hearing with two IRS whistleblowers.

“The second thing that I realized is that these people are just sad, very very sick people that have most likely just faced traumas in their lives that they’ve decided that they are going to turn into an evil that decides that they’re going to inflict on the rest of the world,” Hunter Biden said.",political

Hi, I'm Poki and this is the Wired Auto Complete Interview

and I'm really nervous.

[upbeat music]

I don't know what people have been Googling

and I'm about to find out.

[upbeat music]

What Poki-

What is Poki?

Sometimes I don't even know.

I'm a content creator, streamer, gamer, vlogger.

I kind of do a little bit of everything.

I am me.

She, her, yeah.

So actually the reason this is my name

is 'cause obviously gaming, I play a lot of Pokemon,

and my name is Imane.

So it's supposed to be a play on words.

That's why it's actually supposed to be pronounced Pokemon.

But I understand in English this just reads as Poki main.

So I'm never mad at people when they pronounce it that way.

I'm like, call me whatever you want.

As long as it's nice.

What

made Pokimane famous?

Streaming.

For sure 100% streaming.

I've been streaming since I was 17.

It's been like nine years.

I started doing it as a hobby in high school

and then it became my full-time job

and then I started making content on all platforms

and that's how people know me, I guess.

What is Pokimane's

Valorant rank?

My peak was immortal,

but that was about a year and a half ago.

Right now I'm like diamond.

Actually it's a new season, so I'm not even ranked yet.

But last season I was Diamond.

What is Pokimane's nationality?

I was born in Morocco.

I lived there until I was four years old, little baby,

and then we immigrated to Canada.

I lived there until I was about 20, 21,

and then I moved to LA.

And you know what? Maybe I'll move again soon.

Doing the world tour, okay?

That was so weak.

I'll do the next one harder.

Does Pokimane

like Pokemon?

No, actually I named myself after that 'cause I hate it.

Of course.

I think I've never met someone in the world

who doesn't like Pokemon.

I feel like that would be a really big red flag.

I don't play it as often now as I did growing up,

but it's one of those things where like, you know,

it's near and dear to my heart 'cause it's so nostalgic.

My favorite Pokemon is Eevee

'cause it's like picking seven, eight answers in one.

Is that cheating?

I hope not.

Does Pokimane still stream?

I do.

Just not as often as I did before.

You know, when I first started my career

it was like six days a week, then it was like five,

then it was four, consistent schedule,

and now it's like three, two times,

I'll see you when I see you.

And I like it like that.

'Cause now I'm able to do so many other things luckily.

But I still try to make content regularly,

pursue some new things.

I have some exciting projects.

I just can't tell you yet.

I'm sorry.

Soon.

Soon.

Does Poki play League?

Not unless I'm feeling severely depressed.

And I haven't played in a while, so that's a good sign.

If you get it, you get it.

And for everyone else in this room, don't worry.

It's not that deep.

League is just one of those games.

It's very intense.

But I had my phase.

I will always love it

as the game that got me into streaming.

Don't forget your roots.

But I just don't play it that much nowadays.

Does Pokimane have tattoos?

This is actually a really good question

because I think most people would maybe assume that I do,

but I don't have a single one.

I love the idea of tattoos.

I love people that have tattoos, but if I had one myself,

I know I would love it for a few months

and then I'd be like, get it off.

So instead I really like to opt for henna tattoos.

Does Pokimane have a Fortnite skin?

I actually don't have a Fortnite skin,

but I have a Fortnite dance.

It's like- [Pokimane vocalizing]

The Fortnite team reaches out and they're like,

hey, we wanna partner on a dance or emote with you.

And I just sat and I brainstormed in my little room.

To me it was kind of reminiscent of like the TikTok dances

that were going on at the time.

I'm also not about to do a fricking back flip.

I can't do a back flip.

So that will forever be one of the high points of my career.

Like, having something in a game that represents you,

especially a game that large, that popular,

and one that was so impactful to my career.

It's just like truly, truly a bucket list item.

I like that one.

[Pokimane laughing]

Oh my god.

Okay, first things first.

How you pronounce my name?

Imane Anys.

It's not anus, okay?

I have had too many people in my life be like, is that?

No, my last name is not butthole.

Please stop it.

Where did Imane Anys go to college?

I went to McMaster university.

I studied chemical engineering.

I really, really like and recommend that school.

I mean to be fair,

I've been outta school for like four years.

So, nostalgic feels.

I think most universities in Canada are pretty good, so.

Can Imane Anys speak Arabic?

[speaking foreign language]

So, technically I speak the Moroccan dialect of Arabic,

which isn't like full on classic Arabic.

I can say most sentences,

but maybe I won't remember most words.

I tend to tell people

I speak two and a half languages, you know.

French, English, a sort of Arabic, a sort of little bit.

Anyone who's, you know, ESL

or an immigrant probably gets what I'm saying.

Not a hundred percent, but like a little bit.

Can Imane Anys do magic?

What do you mean?

Actually, can I?

The only kind of magic I do is manifestation.

Sometimes I'll think so hard about something,

I feel like I plan out exactly how to get it.

That's what I consider manifestation.

Not necessarily wishing something into existence,

but thinking about it so hard

that you recognize the opportunity when it comes.

Aside from that, I wish.

I really do wish.

Imane Anys height.

Six foot two,

six foot three on a good day says my Tinder bio.

No, I'm, honestly honest, honest, honest,

I'm five foot three and three quarters.

But I just say five foot four,

'cause three quarters, who cares?

I think it's a very nice, average height.

I'm very content with my height.

How is Poki?

That's so cute.

Whoever's Googling that, okay?

Honestly I'm pretty good today.

Not a lot of people ask, so thank you.

I'm doing swell.

How to join Poki-

I already know what this is.

Discord, Discord server, Discord server?

Discord server.

If you wanna join, to join our community,

it's Discord.gg/Poki.

If you're doing it for malicious purposes,

I don't know, how do you join?

How old Pokimane?

Where's the is?

That's how I know it's little kids looking this up.

I am 27.

My birthday was a month and a half ago.

I feel like I'm at a good age.

It's like I've been through my early twenties.

Now I'm a little more secure and hopeful for the future.

What's next?

A family?

Who knows?

Probably not soon.

How much Pokimane

worth?

See, net worths are kind of complicated.

It's supposed to be how much is in your bank account,

how much are your assets worth?

And I feel like net worths tend to be overestimated

'cause they don't consider LA taxes.

So I'm gonna stick with priceless.

ASMR.

Who Pokimane

in Free Guy.

I'm actually the main character, the guy.

No actually sometimes I wonder

'cause so many people have been like,

oh, I saw you in 'Free Guy.'

I'm like, you guys don't think I'm like the girl actress,

'cause in Free Guy I'm just me.

I'm literally playing me.

I don't know how to act.

I play video games.

What do I know about acting?

I thought it was so cool that in the movie,

instead of just hiring people to act as the streamers,

they got actual streamers to give our actual reactions.

I feel like that was a sign

that they actually wanted to make a movie

that people who are gamers like and think is legit

and it gave an authentic feel, you know?

Who is Poki's

brother?

Actually he was the reason that I got into gaming.

Because you know when you're the younger sibling,

you see everything your older sibling does

and you're like, I wanna do that.

Mom, Dad let me do that.

I honestly just played all the games that he played

and when I wanted to become a streamer

and wanted to go full-time, I was able to

get him to help convince my parents

that what I was doing was legit, you know?

Gaming is still one of the ways that we stay in touch.

We play Valorant together.

He's played on my stream with me so many other times.

Maybe someday he'll stream, too.

I don't know.

Keep an eye out for that.

Who is Poki

in my math solution?

Oh my god.

This is really embarrassing to talk about publicly, okay?

There's a meme.

I can't even tell you the whole meme.

[Crew Member] I have it

here if you want it. You have it?

For sure.

[Crew Member] Who is Pokimane?

In math: my solution.

In history: my queen.

In art: my canvas.

In science: my oxygen.

In geography: my world.

[Pokimane laughing]

It's a very, very cute meme.

It's wholesome.

Is Poki

kid friendly?

Sometimes.

If I were to give myself a grade on that,

I'd give myself like a 70.

So 30% of the time, no.

But 70% of the time, I'm fine.

Why does Poki

have WGM?

Okay, for those that don't know, this is a chess term.

It means woman grand master.

It's a very, very high rank term.

And I was in a chess tournament

so they gave me that title

even though I'm like so far from being like at that rank.

But they gave it to me as a joke and I think people saw that

and they're like, why does she have that title?

It's a joke.

Thank you to them, though.

Makes people think I'm better than I am.

Pokimane

gaming chair?

Right now, I have a Herman Miller.

Do I think it's comfortable?

Kinda.

I'm kind of uncomfortable 'cause my posture is so good

so I force myself to sit in it.

This isn't the best, but it's good for me.

And before that I had like a random,

one of those gaming chairs,

like the ones that kinda look like racing chairs.

I actually kinda like those.

I really do.

They're like-

They keep you so steady.

Where is Poki

right now?

I am in Los Angeles on set with Wired.

The search that I both liked and it caught me off guard

was how is Pokimane?

Like does someone out there really wanna know?

That's really nice.

That's really nice.

Thank you so much.

I'll see you guys in the next one.

Bye.

"If you’ve ever bought an engagement ring, or any other diamond jewelry, you likely know about the “Four Cs”: carat, cut, color, and clarity, which between them determine the quality of a gem. The unofficial fifth C is certification—paperwork from an independent authority validating the qualities and authenticity of a stone. Now, however, a UK startup is aiming to bring yet another C into the mix: code.

Opsydia, a company spun out in 2017 from research conducted at the University of Oxford, is pioneering the laser inscription of near-invisible identifier codes—what it calls “nano-IDs”—inside diamonds.

Each nano-ID consists of a series of submicron-size dots that are imprinted a fifth of a millimeter beneath the gem’s surface, the dots forming a numerical code that’s linked to official certification documents or (increasingly) blockchain ledgers.

Crucially, such an identifier doesn’t come close to registering as the kind of mark that would impact a stone’s quality. Magnification of at least 200X and specifically designed illumination is needed just to spot these subsurface codes. For comparison, specialists in diamond grading laboratories work with between 40X and 80X magnification; a jeweler’s loupe offers considerably less.

“Because the dots are under 1 micron in all dimensions, it’s actually incredibly difficult to characterize the kind of physical change that’s there—it’s close to doing nothing at all,” says Lewis Fish, Opsydia’s head of product, pointing to a 5-mm diamond inscribed with a nano-ID. “We sent that for checking to one of the leading grading laboratories, and they knew the code was there—but they couldn’t find it.”

Using lasers to inscribe tiny codes and even logos onto diamonds is not in itself new. Usually placed on the stone’s girdle (a narrow band at the outer perimeter, dividing upper and lower sections), these have been on offer from grading labs and other providers since the 1980s. But the codes’ surface positioning is also their weakness: They can be polished off. Also, once set in a piece of jewelry they may be obscured.

The proliferation of laser technology, meanwhile, means that bad actors can inscribe either fake codes—for instance, assigning a serial number wrongly designating a higher quality of stone, or indeed labeling a lab-grown diamond as natural—or counterfeit versions of the logos of official laboratories and institutions.

By contrast, because Opsydia’s technology—which is packaged up in a piano-size machine supplied to industry players such as jewelry brands, manufacturers, and grading labs at a cost of £400,000 ($524,000)—places the inscription beneath the surface, it is supposedly out of reach of the scammers.",technology
"Understandably, Israel is reacting with full force against Hamas. If you, Dr. Kissinger, were in Netanyahu’s shoes, would you have reacted differently?

Well, I’m not in Netanyahu’s shoes so that I cannot judge all the forces that impinge on him. I am in favor of a peaceful outcome. I don’t see a peaceful outcome with Hamas involved in the conflict. I would favor negotiations between the Arab world and Israel. I do not see, especially after these events, that direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are very fruitful.

Can there ever be lasting peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution?

A formal peace doesn’t guarantee a lasting peace. The difficulty of the two-state solution is shown by the experience of Hamas. Gaza was made quasi-independent by [former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon in order to test the possibility of a two-state solution. It has led, in fact, to a much more complex situation. It has become so much worse in the last two years than it has been in 2005. So the two-state solution doesn’t guarantee that what we saw in the last weeks won’t happen again.

Imagine for a moment you are secretary of State. And we advance forward a few months. Hopefully then Israel has gotten rid of the Hamas terrorists. Then what do we do? What becomes of Gaza? How does Israel feel secure in that world? How do you negotiate such an outcome?

I believe the West Bank should be put under Jordanian control rather than aim for a two-state solution which leaves one of the two territories determined to overthrow Israel. Egypt has moved closer to the Arab side, so Israel will have a very difficult time going forward. I hope that at the end of it there will be a negotiation, as I had the privilege to conduct at the end of the Yom Kippur War. At that time, Israel was stronger relative to the surrounding powers. Nowadays, it requires a greater involvement of America to prevent a continuation of the conflict.

Would America be willing to show stronger support?

It has to.

It seems to me that the Biden administration is not sending a clear enough message to Iran that it will take military action against Iran if Hezbollah attacks Israel from Lebanon. Instead, its messaging has been almost to appease Iran by pretending Iran is not directly involved in the Gaza attacks. Would you be sending different messages to Iran if you were secretary of State today?

I think if they wanted to do it they could do it. Hezbollah has tens of thousands of missiles on the northern border of Israel. That adds up to a dangerous combination.

Is there the possibility for Russia to show greater involvement in the Middle East, partly as an attempt to divert attention from their problems in Ukraine?

Before the Ukrainian war, Russia was generally in favor of Israel in the confrontation with Arabs. If Russia now would intervene, it has two options: to engage on the side of the Arabs or to appear as a mediator in the crisis — which would be strange in light of the Ukrainian war.

Does the current crisis create the opportunity for the Chinese to attack Taiwan? Things have been awfully quiet there in the last weeks.

In my opinion, China is not ready for such a conflict. It’s a theoretical opportunity. China, in my view, has the capacity to establish a relationship with the United States. But we have to pay attention that on our side the attitude that has developed may not make it impossible.

So then what should the U.S. stance be towards China?

The U.S. should reconcile with China.

One of the great achievements of the Nixon-Kissinger years was to squeeze the Soviet Union out of the Middle East. You are more celebrated for the rapprochement with China than you are for squeezing out the Soviets from the Middle East. Do we need to squeeze Russia and or China out of the Middle East today? Is it a good idea or can they play a constructive role somehow, including in the current crisis?

The ability to squeeze these powers out of the Middle East, or to encourage them to play a positive role depends fundamentally on China-American relationships. And those are not improving. Right now, the greatest difficulty with respect to Russia is that we have not heard what their thinking is, because there is no dialogue with Russia at all.

The decades between 1990 and 2020 were geopolitically relatively calm. Why didn’t we use this time of opening and friendship to create a more peaceful world?

Who should make the world peaceful? In the Middle East: If Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab states were willing to put pressure on the radicals and impose a peaceful solution that would be the best outcome. But I fear that the events of the past weeks will force them into a more radical stance and that would lead to a situation in which the United States will have to balance the equation.

There is a crisis of leadership in our world, a crisis of leadership in the United States, in Israel, in Russia. When you think about the leaders of the future, what are some of the qualities they should possess?

The leaders of the world have failed. They have failed to master the overriding concepts, the fundamentals and the day-to-day tactics. Societies have to find a way to solve their problems without continuously having a series of conflicts. That is the challenge. We have been facing a period of constant conflict resulting in a major wars destroying much of the civilization that has been built.

Dr. Kissinger, you are 100 years young. How do you stay so sharp? What is your secret?

I chose my parents well. I have inherited good genes as a result.

What are your plans?

I have no future plan except to be engaged in matters that are important and to which I can make a small contribution.",political
"Former president Donald Trump seized on an apparent blunder by Casey DeSantis, accusing Florida's first lady of attempting to ""commit organized voter fraud"" with her invitation to out-of-state voters to participate in next month's Iowa caucuses.

Appearing on Fox News on Friday along side her husband, Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, Casey DeSantis claimed that “you do not have to be a resident of Iowa to be able to participate in the caucus."" She encouraged “moms and grandmoms to come, from wherever it might be — North Carolina, South Carolina — and to descend upon the state of Iowa to be a part of the caucus.""

"Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have also expressed concerns about a potential arms alignment between North Korea and Russia. They worry Kim is providing badly needed munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin wage war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology assistance to upgrade his nuclear-armed military.

Speaking after the meeting, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington is working with Seoul and Tokyo to strengthen defense cooperation and improve its response to North Korean missile testing and space-launch activities, including a real-time information sharing arrangement on North Korean missile launches that the countries plan to start at an unspecified date in December.

He also said the countries have agreed to new initiatives to more effectively respond to North Korean efforts to bypass U.S.-led international sanctions that aim to choke off funds for its nuclear weapons and missile program.

“This will be a new effort with respect to cryptocurrency and money laundering and how we disrupt North Korea’s capacity to gain revenue from the hacking and stealing of cryptocurrency and then laundering it through exchanges,” he said.

Sullivan declined to share detailed U.S. assessments on the types and volume of North Korean arms being shipped to Russia and didn’t comment on the specifics of his discussions with South Korean and Japanese officials over the issue, but insisted that “there’s no daylight among us in terms of the types of weapons transfers that we are seeing. And those continue and they represent a grave concern for us.”

South Korean intelligence and military officials have said North Korea may have shipped more than a million artillery shells to Russia beginning in August, weeks before Kim traveled to Russia’s Far East for a rare summit with Putin that sparked international concerns about a potential arms deal. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied U.S. and South Korean claims.

In a joint news conference after Saturday’s trilateral meeting, Cho Tae-yong, South Korea’s national security office director, said the three security advisers reaffirmed North Korea’s obligations under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for its denuclearization and ban any weapons trade with other countries, and agreed to strengthen coordination to ensure that is implemented.

Takeo Akiba, Japan’s national security secretariat secretary general, said the “unprecedented frequency and patterns” of North Korean ballistic missile launches necessitate a deeper and more effective partnership between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.

South Korea, the U.S., Japan and Australia have also announced their own sanctions on North Korea over its spy satellite launch last month. North Korea argues it the right to launch spy satellites to monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat of its nuclear-capable missiles.

During his conversation with reporters, Sullivan said the allies are preparing for the possibility that North Korea will up the ante of its weapons demonstrations and threats in 2024, possibly including the country’s seventh nuclear test.

Direct military action is also a concern after the North recently announced it was abandoning a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement on reducing border tensions after the South partially suspended the agreement, which had established border buffers and no-fly zones. Some experts say that has raised the risk of border-area shootings or clashes.

“Look, when a country announces its intent to walk away from a set of measures that are designed to help reduce risk and increase stability, our concern for potential incidents, provocations has to go up,” Sullivan said, though he said the full implications of the North’s announcement is not immediately clear.

Sullivan held separate bilateral talks Friday with Cho and Akiba and also met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.

The U.S., South Korean and Japanese national security advisers last held a trilateral meeting in June in Tokyo.

South Korean intelligence officials have said the Russians likely provided technology support for North Korea’s successful satellite launch in November, which followed two failed launches.

North Korea has said its spy satellite transmitted imagery with space views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite photos. Many outside experts question whether the North’s satellite is sophisticated enough to send militarily useful high-resolution imagery.

Kim has vowed to launch more satellites, saying his military needs to acquire space-based reconnaissance capabilities.

South Korean officials have also said North Korea-made rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons could have been used by Hamas during its Oct. 7 assault on Israel and that the North could be considering selling weapons to militant groups in the Middle East.

Sullivan said that the United States has not seen any specific evidence of that, but remains vigilant about the possibility.

“I think given North Korea’s history of proliferation activities, including to reprehensible actors in other contexts across history, it’s a legitimate concern,” he said.",political
"When OpenAI’s board asked Sam Altman to return a day after they fired him, he initially felt defiant, hurt, and angry.

“It took me a few minutes to snap out of it and get over the ego and emotions to then be like, ‘Yeah, of course I want to do that,’” he told me by phone on Wednesday. “Obviously, I really loved the company and had poured my life force into this for the last four and a half years full time, but really longer than that with most of my time. And we’re making such great progress on the mission that I care so much about, the mission of safe and beneficial AGI.”

During our interview, Altman repeatedly declined to answer the main question on everyone’s minds: exactly why he was fired to begin with. OpenAI’s new board, led by Bret Taylor, is going to conduct an independent investigation into what went down. “I very much welcome that,” Altman told me.

Below is my full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and CTO Mira Murati, lightly edited for clarity:

Sam, I would like to address, first, the elephant in the room, which is that we still don’t know exactly why you were fired to begin with. Why do you think you were fired?

Sam Altman: The board is going to do an independent review here. I very much welcome that. I don’t have much else to say now, but I’m looking forward to learning more.

Why do you think the board said it lost trust in you?

SA: That will be a better question for them.

You said on X just now that “it’s clear that there were real misunderstandings” between yourself and members of the board. What were those misunderstandings?

SA: I don’t feel ready to go talk about that yet. I think it’s very important to let this review process run. I’m happy to talk about anything forward-looking. And I imagine there will be some time where I’m very happy to talk about what happened here, but not now.

Can you tell me why you can’t talk about it right now?

SA: I just want to let this process go and not interfere.

You talked about Ilya Sutskever [OpenAI’s chief scientist] in your note [to employees]. Can you let me in a little bit on why he changed his mind and decided to side with everyone else?

Mira Murati: We don’t know. You’d have to ask Ilya that.

Sam, what was, in hindsight, the main driving force here that got you to come back?

SA: It was really interesting. Saturday morning, some of the board called me and asked if I’d be up for talking about it. And my immediate reaction was sort of one of defiance. It was like, “Man, I’m hurt and angry, and I think this sucks.”

“It took me a few minutes to snap out of it and get over the ego and emotions”

And then, pretty immediately, I started thinking about, like, obviously, I really loved the company and had poured my life force into this for the last four and a half years full time, but really longer than that with most of my time. And we’re making such great progress on the mission I care so much about, the mission of safe and beneficial AGI. But also the people here and all of the partners who have taken such big bets on us, and Mira and the leadership team and all of the people here who do incredible work. It took me a few minutes to snap out of it and get over the ego and emotions to then be like, “Yeah, of course I want to do that.”

So the board asked you to come back?

SA: Yeah.

And you were initially hesitant?

SA: Not for long. There are a lot of feelings there after that happened to me.

It was clear that the employees were with you. How big of a factor do you think that was?

SA: Definitely we have come through this with a stronger and more unified and focused and committed team. I thought we had great conviction and focus before, and now I think we have way, way, way more. So that’s my silver lining to all of this.

Throughout this whole thing, we did not lose a single employee, a single customer. Not only did they keep the products up even in the face of very difficult-to-manage growth, they also shipped new features. Research progress continued.

Do you want back on the board?

SA: This is going to sound like a PR talking point: it’s not my area of focus right now. I have a mountain of very difficult, important, and urgent work. I want to be able to do my job well, but it’s not like [being] on the board or not. That’s not the thing I’m spending my time thinking about right now.

What does “improving our governance structure” mean? Is the nonprofit holding company structure going to change?

“I totally get why people want an answer right now. But I also think it’s totally unreasonable to expect it.”

SA: It’s a better question for the board members, but also not right now. The honest answer is they need time, and we will support them in this to really go off and think about it. Clearly, our governance structure had a problem. And the best way to fix that problem is going to take a while. And I totally get why people want an answer right now. But I also think it’s totally unreasonable to expect it.

Why do you think that’s unreasonable? I think people see a lot of vagaries about what happened. And it seems like it was disagreements, not malfeasance, or anything like that.

SA: Oh, just because designing a really good governance structure, especially for such an impactful technology, is not a one-week question. It’s going to take a real amount of time for people to think through this, to debate, to get outside perspectives, for pressure testing. That just takes a while.

Is anything about OpenAI’s approach to safety work changing as a result of the events that just unfolded?

MM: No. This has nothing to do with safety.

The reports about the Q* model breakthrough that you all recently made, what’s going on there?

SA: No particular comment on that unfortunate leak. But what we have been saying — two weeks ago, what we are saying today, what we’ve been saying a year ago, what we were saying earlier on — is that we expect progress in this technology to continue to be rapid and also that we expect to continue to work very hard to figure out how to make it safe and beneficial. That’s why we got up every day before. That’s why we will get up every day in the future. I think we have been extraordinarily consistent on that.

Without commenting on any specific thing or project or whatever, we believe that progress is research. You can always hit a wall, but we expect that progress will continue to be significant. And we want to engage with the world about that and figure out how to make this as good as we possibly can.

Last question: I am sure you’re still thinking through all this. I know it’s very fresh. What lesson have you learned from this whole saga?

SA: I think I don’t yet have a neat, pithy sound bite answer there. Clearly a lot, but I’m still stumbling through it all. I mean, definitely there will be a lot to say there, but I don’t think I have a ready to go... all I would have is a long, rambling answer at this point.

Okay, we’ll save it for another time.

After we hang up, Altman calls back moments later.

SA: I learned that the company can truly function without me, and that’s a very nice thing. I’m very happy to be back, don’t get me wrong on that. But I come back without any of the stress of, “Oh man, I got to do this, or the company needs me or whatever.” I selfishly feel good because either I picked great leaders or I mentored them well. It’s very nice to feel like the company will be totally fine without me, and the team is ready and has leveled up.",technology
"Ubisoft just revealed new details about a Prince of Persia game — and no, it wasn’t the long-delayed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake. At Summer Game Fest 2023, Ubisoft kicked off the show with a new side-scrolling action platformer, called Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.

“Dash into a stylish and thrilling action-adventure platformer game set in a mythological Persian world where the boundaries of time and space are yours to manipulate,” according to the game’s website. You’ll be able to access “time powers” for fighting and platforming, and the game will have different biomes that have their own “identity, wonders, and dangers.”

Based on the game’s reveal trailer, it looks really fluid to play — my only experience with the series is the original Sands of Time, and The Lost Crown seems to carry over much of what I liked about that game. (It will have to tide us over for a bit since the Sands of Time remake was just rebooted.) And according to a press release, the game is “inspired by the Metroidvania structure,” meaning you’ll be able to “explore a handcrafted world at their own pace.” Sign me up.

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is set to release on January 18th, 2024, for Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ubisoft will be revealing more about the game on June 12th at its Ubisoft Forward show.",technology
"Update December 8th, 4:55PM ET: Three days after this story was initially published, Apple found a way to block Beeper Mini, effectively shutting down the service. The original story follows.

Earlier this year, a developer slid into Eric Migicovsky’s DMs with a spectacular claim: that he had reverse engineered Apple’s iMessage, allowing any device — Android, Windows, whatever — to send messages as a blue bubble. Migicovsky didn’t believe what he was reading.

“I said, ‘Bullshit, no one has done that. No one on earth has done that,’” said Migicovsky, CEO of the messaging startup Beeper. He’d tried to do it himself, and he’d messaged everyone he could find who’d ever gotten close. “No one had put all the pieces together.”

But now there was this developer in his DMs — a 16-year-old high school student, of all people — linking him to a prototype. And it worked.

That prototype became the basis for a new Android app, called Beeper Mini, that Migicovsky’s startup is launching today. Open the app, and it’ll look at all of your text message conversations, figure out which ones are from iMessage users, and switch them over to blue bubble conversations on Apple’s platform. From then on, whenever you message an iPhone user through Beeper Mini, you’ll be using iMessage, and they’ll be none the wiser.

There were no lost messages, no broken group chats

I’ve been using the app for the past few weeks, and I’ve been surprised at how smoothly it works. Messages sent from Beeper Mini on my Pixel 8 appear as blue bubbles on the iPhones of my friends and family members. Group chats I’m on automatically switched over to iMessage as soon as someone fired off a meme. Reactions, threads, photos, and videos (without the messy text message compression) all came through. The best thing I can say about Beeper Mini is that almost no one noticed I was using it: blue bubbles just started appearing — no lost messages to speak of.

Beeper Mini joins a growing list of apps trying to hack the iMessage experience onto Android, but Migicovsky is adamant that Beeper Mini is not like the other services out there: it is directly sending iMessages.

Other services — including Beeper’s previous iMessage implementation — would relay messages through a Mac hosted in the cloud. That poses real security problems, as recently exemplified by Sunbird and its Nothing-branded spinoff, Nothing Chats. Nothing’s app was launched and pulled in just four days after serious security issues were discovered; Sunbird pulled its app shortly thereafter.

Beeper Mini avoids some of those problems because it’s operating in a fundamentally different way. Its developers figured out how to register a phone number with iMessage, send messages directly to Apple’s servers, and have messages sent back to your phone natively inside the app. It was a tricky process that involved deconstructing Apple’s messaging pipeline from start to finish. Beeper’s team had to figure out where to send the messages, what the messages needed to look like, and how to pull them back down from the cloud. The hardest part, Migicovsky said, was cracking what is essentially Apple’s padlock on the whole system: a check to see whether the connected device is a genuine Apple product.

“We jailbroke iPhones then dove deep into the OS to see how everything worked,” Migicovsky wrote to me over iMessage. “Then wrote new code from scratch to reproduce everything inside our Android app.”

Beeper doesn’t see your messages, contacts, or password

The result, according to Migicovsky, is a third-party implementation of iMessage that is actually secure: Beeper doesn’t see your messages, your contacts, or your Apple ID password. (It doesn’t even need you to log in.) It is, he says, just connecting to Apple’s servers like an iPhone would.

Migicovsky knows that security will be the big question on potential users’ minds. To address concerns, Migicovsky says Beeper’s iMessage code will be open source for others to review. Beeper’s CTO, Brad Murray, also spent some time trying to break open the system as if he were an attacker and is publishing his findings.

The bigger question may be how long Beeper Mini can survive. Migicovsky believes he’s on the right side of the law (he points to a copyright carveout for reverse engineering and says there’s no Apple code in Beeper Mini); and he believes it’d be too difficult for Apple to cut Beeper off without also breaking iMessage for legions of genuine Apple devices. I’m not so sure on either count — Apple is deeply protective of iMessage as a lock-in mechanism for the iPhone, and it’s hard to imagine the company ignoring the spate of third-party iMessage solutions forever.

At the very least, Beeper has been operating the less secure kind of iMessage relay for nearly three years, and Migicovsky says he hasn’t heard a word from Apple yet. Apple didn’t respond to The Verge’s request for comment about third-party iMessage apps.

Beeper initially launched in 2021, promising to build a singular home for all your messaging. The company has raised $16 million in pursuit of that goal and grown in size to about 20 people. The 16-year-old developer who reverse engineered iMessage is now working for Beeper as a contractor; Migicovsky declined to share further details about the student, citing privacy concerns. A GitHub page belonging to the student says he lives in Pennsylvania.

Beeper Mini lands at a strange moment for both Beeper and iMessage: Apple recently said it would adopt the RCS messaging standard, bringing many of the key benefits of iMessage — good quality photos, read receipts, and eventually encryption — to cross-platform texting. Once those features arrive, Beeper will largely just be offering you that coveted blue bubble.

Most people didn’t notice the bubbles had turned blue

In my experience, most people I messaged simply didn’t notice. The group thread moved on. Photos came through. Messages were just a different color. Of course, that’s the whole thing with the blue / green bubble divide: it’s largely artificial. It’s often not about the ability to have a chat, just to identify the odd person out. That didn’t matter much for me, but I suspect it will for many others — and for those who feel punished by their green bubbles, maybe Beeper Mini will be worth using.

At launch, the service will cost $2 per month and only offer access to iMessage. Migicovsky says Beeper Mini will eventually drop the “Mini” branding and integrate all the other chat services offered on Beeper’s main app — WhatsApp, Messenger, Signal, and so on, all hacked together to work inside a single convenient interface. My biggest complaint at the moment is that Beeper Mini doesn’t support SMS and RCS, so this one-day all-in-one app is currently dividing my texting experience in two. Migicovsky says bundling in SMS and RCS is coming, too. All those extra services might just cost a little more, though.",technology

[Narrator] These illusions pop off the pavement

into the real world and are created by this man,

former NASA illustrator-turned-3D artist, Kurt Wenner.

What illusion does, fundamentally,

it tells us or reminds us that everything we think is real

is in some way an illusion.

The geometry of the illusions is very precise

and they're made to be seen from exactly one point in space.

Here was a work where I designed

the central figure of Bacchus.

The work's called The Wine Fountain.

Piece is enormous.

Each one of these squares is quite large as well,

you can see by the people sitting on the work

[Narrator] Mapping this precise visual geometry begins

with diligent planning using pencil and paper.

So here's an example of how I start a picture.

Here, I start with the grid, and then on top of the grid,

I start to compose using what's called the thumbnail sketch.

Thumbnail sketch, because one of these horse's heads

is literally the size of my thumbnail.

The information from each one of these squares

is going to then be turned back into a real square,

meaning X equals Y.

And so what we see here is that,

when we're toward my viewpoint,

this is very much like a normal square.

I have to distort it very little.

This square I have to distort more,

this one I'll have to distort more, and so on and so on

until I have to really blow this square out

to get it back into a square.

Starting from the thumbnail, I then work my way up

to a more finished line drawing.

And then what happens here is I scan

and print the little detail on another piece of paper,

which looks a lot rougher, and then I refine the detail

on this and then I cut them together.

This whole composition here needs to be blown out

in the sense that I have to take each one

of these prospective curvilinear squares

and turn it back into a square square.

And when I do that,

the composition ends up looking like this.

[peaceful music]

[Narrator] Making a full-scale work

would take days to complete.

But Kurt can demonstrate his creative process

on a smaller scale.

This is free-hand drawing and there would almost never

in any case be a trace on the pavement.

The kind of chalk I'm drawing with is a commercial chalk

that you can buy, whereas the other chalks you see

in these different containers are handmade pastels.

I do make them myself.

Nobody makes a pastel where the pigment content is 100%.

I just wanted the colors to be stronger and blend less.

So my pastels are made with pure pigments

which means they're the powdered color,

the oxides or the chemicals that make the color

are the entire content of the pastels,

whereas when you buy a pastel or a chalk,

it's about 30% of the content.

Traditionally, you know, of course every image

is its own thing, but an optimal size

is about 15 feet by 15 feet and that's the size

where you get the most bang from your buck.

So from the point of view of a person standing

at the base of the drawing and, say, taking a photo

which has become the reality at least of this work,

that the image fits just about the right amount

of the camera frame compared to the environment

around the image and other spectators.

People misunderstand the impermanence.

People think you do the work and then it goes away.

But when you're dealing with materials

and situations where the work is impermanent,

it doesn't work that way.

The work is going away while you're doing it,

so it's like building a sandcastle where you get, you know,

a little tower on the left side and you go build a tower

on the right side, and the left one has fallen down.

This is the best possible office anybody could have

when it's this beautiful day when the temperature's nice.

Nothing better than this office,

but it can also be an office where it's rainy,

it's cold, it's windy, or noisy, or unbelievably hot.

When I did this piece during an event,

the pavement was so hot that it was literally burning

the materials I was working with.

[Narrator] Regardless of the challenges,

Kurt brings his pieces to life,

sometimes in a jaw dropping scale.

This was the world record size pavement art,

440 feet long.

One of the interesting geometrical parts of this work

is that the bottom part of the work was done

on the ground at full size.

So while the bottom of the painting,

where the people are standing,

was painted on the pavement itself, on this,

it's actually an airstrip,

the part above where this panoramic part was painted

on a curved panel, much smaller,

which was suspended from scaffolding.

So the shot is a camera shooting through this curved panel

which is cut out here and then seeing

the enormous pavement art underneath

with all the people standing on it,

most of whom were the artists that helped execute this work.

[jazzy music]

[Narrator] Kurt's art has always been a consuming passion,

fascinated by how he can plant the extraordinary

in the midst of every day.

How much time have I spent in life thinking about this?

I think I've spent my entire life thinking about this,

starting from when I was eight years old.

I'm 64 years old, so that puts me at well over

half a century that I've been thinking about these problems.

[Interviewer] Is this similar

to how you model your pieces?

Yeah, this is exactly how I model my pieces,

especially before when I was doing them,

before we had photography and Photoshop and all of that.

The drawing is in scale, which means

that these grid lines here, each are one inch by one inch,

they correspond to one foot by one foot in real life.

This little model here is about five and a half inches tall,

as is this one, and then this would tell me

that a person standing with a eye level

of five and a half feet standing here

and a person five and a half feet standing at the back end

of an eight foot by 10 foot image.

This will appear in a certain way with a lens

which is at this particular distance, which we fixed,

and this particular height and is centered

on the pavement surface.

And the iPhone then is gonna tell me,

in the viewfinder, what a person would see.

Now the first thing to do, though, is to get the focal point

in the right place.

So I do this by having these two little towers

and I can move the two towers up to these lines

and position exactly where my lens is gonna be.

So you have to let the camera tell you

where its focal point is by looking at the image

through the lens you're gonna be using.

Eventually somebody would be drawing

or composing in this area, but there's a number of examples

of things they can use in order to see the effect.

So at this point, this effect

of this person standing on this sphere.

So here's the image in the correct position.

And then if I take it and move it this way,

of course, the illusion's going to fold up.

It almost appears like a paper pop-up book

where the the whole thing folds down and becomes flat.

And this way it wouldn't be illusionistic.

It's only gonna be an illusion when it's exactly

in the right position.

[Narrator] This ability to bend reality

with geometry started when Kurt was a young man

with some parental encouragement.

My father saw that I was interested in art.

He was a mathematician and scientist,

so he gave me this little paperback book

called The Geometry of Art and Life.

And this little book described how geometry is used,

both in art and by nature.

And so that book fascinated me.

I had worked for NASA before and had developed certain ways

of doing perspectives to capture very, very wide angle views

of things, especially planets and spacecraft.

When I left my job and started working

on the streets of Rome as a pavement artist,

I started by doing classical works.

After a while, I wanted to do my own original works

and I started to also notice that the works on the pavement

were seen always from the base of the work,

which means people were looking as much across the surface

of the work as they were looking down at the work.

So I decided I could use some of the technology

or the techniques that I used at NASA on the street,

calculating the actual position of the viewer,

and making the work accurate from that position

rather than composing the work

as if it were a wall painting.

It was a little bit strange because the first piece

where I looked at and I said, Oh this is a new art form,

this never existed before, was the Dies Irae piece.

I didn't do a drawing for this piece.

I actually composed it on the street,

painstakingly stretching out all

of the different figures using geometry

and considering each figure separately.

Later on, I figured more of an overall geometrical formula,

which allows me to design the works

on paper, in scale, and then enlarge them.

This piece took me about six weeks to design and finish

and then, in this case, the design and the finish

was on the same spot because I didn't

have preliminary drawings from it.

[Interviewer] Do you do this art

for you or for the public?

That is such a profound question,

is this art for me or for the public?

That's a question that could actually be applied to all art.

In some way, I think artists are always expecting

that they're communicating with other people.

This is an art form which grew up as a communication tool.

It grew up as a way to engage the public.

The beauty of the work is to consider the environment,

the spectators, the public, the point of view of the viewer,

and to compose a work which creates a relationship

between all those three elements.

"The ROG Phone 7 and Phone 7 Ultimate are the latest devices in Asus’ line of gaming-focused smartphones. They’re available to preorder in Europe and Taiwan starting today and will ship later this month. In Europe, the Phone 7 starts at €999 (£999.99), while the Phone 7 Ultimate starts at €1,399 (£1,199.99).

Given their gaming focus, both devices are, of course, equipped with Qualcomm’s latest flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor. But there’s also an “upgraded GameCool 7 thermal system” that’s designed to extract as much performance as possible out of this processor by keeping it cool under load. Asus claims the phones’ vapor chamber cooling system dissipates heat up to 168 percent more efficiently than last year’s ROG Phone 6.

The AeroActive Cooler 7, which comes bundled with the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate. Image: Asus

If you’re after yet more cooling, the Ultimate version of the phone comes with an active cooling fan accessory, the AeroActive Cooler 7. When it’s attached, a small air inlet (the AeroActive Portal) in the handset opens and allows cool air to pass directly over the vapor chamber’s cooling fins. Asus says this allows for up to an extra 20 percent of thermal efficiency. The Portal previously appeared on last year’s ROG Phone 6D Ultimate and doesn’t appear to have stopped the ROG Phone 7 Ultimate from getting an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.

The AeroActive Cooler 7 also features a built-in subwoofer that Asus claims delivers 77 percent more bass volume. That’s in addition to the phone’s dual front-firing speakers that apparently have 50 percent more “effective volume” than last year’s phone. Finally, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack if you’d rather skip the built-in speakers entirely.

As well as improving cooling and sound, the AeroActive Cooler 7 also includes four physical buttons for a more traditional controller experience, a kickstand, RGB lighting (obviously), and an additional USB-C port and 3.5mm headphone jack.

Underneath all these gaming features, the ROG Phone 7 and 7 Ultimate are pretty typical smartphones. Both phones have 6.78-inch OLED displays with a peak brightness of 1,500 nits and a refresh rate of 165Hz. They’re powered by 6,000mAh batteries that can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and they have a trio of rear cameras, including a 50-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultrawide, and 5-megapixel macro. The Ultimate model also comes with a customizable display on its rear, as we’ve seen with previous ROG phones like the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.",technology
"It’s no secret that we’re huge fans of the Raspberry Pi Pico here at Tom’s Hardware. If you can cram a Pi into it, we’re usually right on board no matter how unnecessary it is. Today we’ve got another awesome Pi mashup that we haven’t come across before—this one created by a maker who goes by the handle ASloth over at YouTube. With the help of our favorite microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico, ASloth has made an awesome umbrella light show .

The project design is straightforward but the end result is so satisfying. A Raspberry Pi Pico is used to control a series of addressable RGB LEDs. These LEDs form a strip, rather than wiring up individual LEDs. The LEDs are installed so they run along the ribs of the umbrella. The canopy impacts the light dispersion and, in this case, creates a nice glow.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: ASloth) (Image credit: ASloth) (Image credit: ASloth)

The umbrella is programmed to do more than just light up, although that in itself is pretty useful in some situations. ASloth set up this Pico-powered umbrella to handle a variety of pre-programmed animations and light effects. These are stored locally on an external SD card, interfaced with the Pico using SPI. The additional storage make it easy to update or flash the umbrella with new light animations.

ASloth shared a demo video of the umbrella and also took time to explain more about its construction. In the video, he confirms that the Pico is connected to a WS2812b LED strip. The system receives power from a portable charger and can be operated using a button. The umbrella used doesn’t matter too much but, again, the canopy color and material will impact how the light comes through.

To help with animations, ASloth developed a simulator that breaks up the LED strips into columns and rows. This makes it much easier to visualize animations before implementing them in the code. You can program each light on its own or address entire sections at once.

If you want to see this Raspberry Pi project in action, head over to the official ASloth YouTube channel and be sure to follow him for more cool projects as well as any future updates on this one.",technology
"The unveiling of Tesla’s Cybertruck last week was full of surprises, but none more shocking than the moment when lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed two of the vehicle’s “armor glass” windows onstage with a metal ball. It certainly wasn’t the result CEO Elon Musk was expecting, who could be heard muttering “oh my fucking god” under his breath before being forced to complete his presentation in front of the fractured panes.

But Musk says he knows what went wrong, and explained things on Twitter. Right before the metal ball test, von Holzhausen smacked the door with a sledgehammer on stage to prove its durability (and unlike the glass, it was fine), and Musk says this impact “cracked base of glass,” which is why the windows subsequently smashed when hit by the ball.

The moment the first window of the Cybertruck was smashed.

This seems plausible, especially as Musk also shared a slow motion video of von Holzhausen performing the same exact test before the event, with the ball bouncing harmlessly off the window. The combined impacts likely weakened the glass, setting the stage for the eventual smash. (Though why the back window broke as well isn’t clear: the passenger door didn’t get whomped by the sledgehammer.)

At any rate, the smashed glass was just one moment in an event which gave viewers plenty to talk about without the on-stage mishaps. The divisive design and impressive specs of the Cybertruck have caught the world’s attention, and since the unveiling Musk has been drip-feeding bits of information on Twitter to keep people engaged.

Solar panels on the roof that charge the car as it drives? We’re doing it, says Musk. A new matte black finish? “Sure,” he says. The Tesla CEO even suggested a second, “smaller” version of the Cybertruck would make sense in the “long term.”",technology

Hi, my name is Daphna Shohamy.

I'm a neuroscientist at Columbia University.

And today I've been asked to explain memory

at five levels of increasing complexity.

My research aims to understand how memories are created

and how they shape who we are,

what we do, and the decisions we make.

[gentle music]

We're here today to talk about memory.

When I say the word memory what comes to your mind?

Like I once went on vacation to Dominican Republic.

I think I was like six or five years old.

So on your trip what was the funnest day ever?

There was this pool, I love pools.

And then there's a slide you go down

and there's pool noodles in there too.

And then there's a little tiny sandbox.

It's pretty amazing, right?

Because it happened like a year or two ago.

Our memory is basically a record in our brain

of something that happened in the past,

but that record it created isn't perfect.

So that day, do you remember was the pool at your hotel?

I don't really remember.

Do you remember from that day what color towel you used

when you got out of the pool?

I think the one I used was a dark blue or a light blue or,

or like sort of a teal.

When you were telling me about the sandbox,

it felt like you didn't have to make that guess,

that you could just see the sandbox in your eyes.

I asked you about the towel.

It doesn't come to mind immediately,

but you can stop and think about it

and kind of make a good guess because there are things

you know about the world.

And for those of us who study memory

that's a really strong hint as to how memory works.

And so for you your memory kept all the fun stuff

and all the stuff that was important to you,

but the details like did you have to have a ticket

to get in or how you got there,

all these other less interesting, less exciting aspects,

your brain kind of decided letting go

of all that information.

I think as you get older you start forgetting things more

because you have to make space for new things,

which is why you forget stuff.

Yeah, that's a great insight.

Basically we can't remember everything.

So when you tell us this memory of that vacation

and your brain is able to kind of play almost this movie

of a memory, a moment, a day that you had in your life

a while ago, where do those memories come from?

I do know that there's different parts of the brain.

So there's probably a part of your brain

that remembers a bunch of stuff.

The hippocampus is a part of your brain that if you

kind of took it out and looked at it,

it looks a lot like a seahorse

and it plays a really important role in creating those kinds

of memories that help you two years after your vacation

share with me what happened that day,

all these details of that day.

There's another part of the brain.

It's actually also important for memory

and it's called the amygdala and it is important for keeping

all the kind of emotional processing going for memory.

So memory for things that are really scary,

it's gonna talk to the hippocampus now

and get that memory to be really strong.

Why do you think it might be important

to remember scary things?

Let's say you, you accidentally cut yourself.

Then your brain makes a note

and says don't get too close to sharp things,

or you're going to cut yourself again.

You got it.

And so we don't just remember everything

and we don't remember random things.

We remember the things that matter to us the most.

So Abigail based on our conversation today,

can you tell me what is a memory?

A memory is something stored in your hippocampus

and your hippocampus is a part of your brain.

It's just a big record.

And sometimes you can forget parts of the record

that's not that important to you.

You got it.

[gentle music]

What do you know about memory?

I know when you see something you could like

kind of like picture it,

like in your head you can imagine it.

I remember yesterday I got like orange juice,

but let's say like a year or two, you might think like, oh,

that day I got water.

And on one hand memory is like a record of something

that happened in the past that we can carry with us

and we can like bring it back to mind.

And on the other hand we need to be a little bit suspicious

sometimes because we might get it wrong.

In what world would that memory of the orange juice

maybe be useful?

Let's say you grew up in a place that the orange juice

is just meh, and then you go on vacation going somewhere

and then it might change how you feel about orange juice.

Sometimes, you know, memory is doing something

much simpler but no less important for us,

which is it's helping us figure out what's good

and what's bad.

And if we can remember what's good

and what's bad from what we did in the past,

that can help us make decisions about what to do next time.

So Dylan, you may be surprised to learn this,

but we asked your mom what some of your

favorite candies are.

So you have to make a decision between these two candies

and whichever one you pick,

you actually get to take with you.

I wish I could say both,

but I guess I'll go with pixie sticks.

There you go, there is your decision.

Okay, you can take those.

It took you some time there.

You looked like you were really working hard

at that problem.

And that's interesting because actually we know that from

research that when people have to make a decision between

two things they like equally,

some people like economists think oh those are the easiest

decisions because they're both good options.

But as psychologists and neuroscientists we know

it's the opposite.

One of the reasons is because there's no simple answer of

like I know that one's better I'm just gonna go with it.

And so we think that that's the kind of decision where

memory is especially important because you have to kind of

come up with more information.

Exactly, and then also like after it was like,

maybe like I would've, enjoyed this more than that

and like maybe I should've chose the other one.

And you don't know.

Everything you just said is exactly

what we know from research.

All the thoughts running through your mind,

were really at kind of about a prediction

into the future, right?

You're like, how, how will this taste if,

when it's in my mouth or how will I feel about my decision

down the road?

You know we think of memory as something in the past,

but it's an example of how you use your memories of these

two candies to predict what's gonna happen in the future

so that you can make a decision in the present.

But you did it, you made your way through that torture.

And now you've got to keep the candy.

Am I always gonna like choose pixie sticks

or sour patch kids?

What's gonna like change that?

We fluctuate a lot because we use different kinds of memory

to kind of resolve the uncertainty basically every time.

But also the way we make decisions will change

because our memories change.

What's interesting about your brain as a teenager is that we

know it's actually a phase of life where the brain is

especially sensitive to rewards,

to things that are exciting and positive.

It's a phase of life where those rewards,

whether it's candy or your friends or whatever it is

that's exciting can have an especially powerful control

over the decisions you make and the memories you create.

[gentle music]

Is there any particular memory for you that you feel has

been either kind of influential in your,

in deciding which areas to pursue or that you feel is sort

of emblematic of what it is to have a memory?

I was probably six years old

and my aunt who had stage four ovarian cancer,

she battled it for 20 years.

She got me my first science kit and she asked me to cure

cancer and I will never forget running into my aunt's room

and just opening up the box and seeing that microscope,

it was a tiny little blue one

and the little microscope slides and the little pipettes.

So they just, that memory will never be forgotten

my whole life.

I've got one too.

I was nine and we were at the science expo in San Francisco.

Two scientists were dissecting an eye, a cow's eye.

And I was like that is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

And something about that that carried me forward.

Something happened so long ago,

it left some long lasting trace through neural circuits

and it continues to shape the decisions we make

about what to study and what to do.

Just being able to apply those memories in the future

is just so crucial in everyday life of the humans

and the fact that we're learning how that works.

And I would love to hear more about your side of memory

and the mechanisms that you're studying.

So we're interested in the idea that memory is kind of

a pervasive force that shapes all our behaviors.

And we're trying to understand how different kinds of memory

are organized in different structures of the brain.

And then to understand how those different structures work

together to orchestrate complex cognitive behaviors

like decision-making or reasoning and thinking.

So in your research or you focus more on implicit

or explicit memory?

My work has actually kind of pushed against

that distinction between memories that kind of are

consciously accessible versus unconscious.

When you say that you don't necessarily look at implicit

and explicit memory as anything different,

if you were to take a step back,

what would you define as implicit and explicit memory?

The best way to kind of think about that distinction

really goes back historically to one of the most important

discoveries in memory research.

The patient was referred to famously as patient HM.

The neurosurgeon went in and removed the tissue that

happened to be right around the hippocampus

on both the left side and the right side of HM's brain.

But then they started noticing something odd

in his behavior.

He was not able to create new memories of the experiences

he had after the surgery.

And that led Brenda Milner and her colleagues to report that

the hippocampus was very important for memory,

but a one particular kind, these sort of explicit,

or as now referred to them episodic memories.

But the hippocampus was not necessary for learning skills

like mirror tracing,

things that you can't necessarily articulate

but you just get better at over time.

And it really led to a couple of decades or more even

of an enormous amount of very important work that kind

of kept on breaking memory down further

and further into different types.

Episodic and semantic as both forms of explicit memory

where episodic refers to memory for an event that happened

like what you did yesterday morning

and semantic refers to general knowledge about the world.

Implicit memory is being broken down into a bunch of

different kinds like skills or habits or conditioning.

And when I started graduate school,

many of us felt kind of the next question was really to

understand how do we now understand how they work together.

This was right around when functional magnetic resonance

imaging started becoming a popular tool

for measuring brain activity.

We could scan the entire brain and we could ask questions

about multiple brain regions at once.

And we discovered that what we might expect

during a skill learning task that only the striatum

might show activity,

that we also saw the activity in the hippocampus.

Or when we asked someone to form an episodic memory

that we thought might depend only on the hippocampus

we suddenly also saw activity in the prefrontal cortex.

And so the confluence of these new ideas and questions about

how different forms of memory interact

together with the development of new tools for studying

the human mind and brain allowed us to kind of adjust

our view of memory systems,

to think of them less as multiple completely separate

independent systems and instead to try to understand how

they really work in concert with each other

and give rise to all kinds of behaviors that might not fit

neatly into one category or another.

Are the connectivities that you're seeing using the FMRI

in your studies, are they different when you look at

the implicit and explicit memories?

Are you seeing more activity in the striatum in comparison

to the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex?

Yeah, you know things are kind of breaking down

in unexpected ways I'd say.

I think there's been a lot of really great work out of

multiple labs showing hippocampal activity related to

behaviors that don't look anything like episodic memories,

but which might depend on episodic memories right?

So for example also when you're making a decision about how

to choose between two good options

that suddenly you might see activity in the hippocampus

related to the choice itself,

others have found that you find activity in the hippocampus

not only when people are forming memories,

but also when they're imagining events that are

gonna happen in the future.

So it kind of forced us to rethink the way we define what

the hippocampus might be doing in a way that can account for

creating memories, thinking about the future,

making decisions and other kinds of behaviors that involve

what we would refer to you in the field

as relational processing.

And that raises all kinds of new questions about

what memory really is.

Reminiscing about our early influences that made us

want to be scientists is that, you know,

of course we know, we know better than to think that those

are necessarily accurate memories.

You know this reminds me of sort of the

classic example from literature when people talk about

memory of course is Marcel Proust's

Madeleine in Remembrance of Things Past.

Where in the book it's this taste for the,

for the protagonist this taste of the crumbs of

the Madeleine cookie and the tea that bring him back

to his childhood.

You know, seven volumes then emerge of memories of,

of that childhood.

Digging further into earlier drafts of Proust's novel

that initially it didn't describe a Madeleine at all.

It's very interesting to see the imperfections

of the human brain and being able to rewrite something

that happened to you and fully believe it yourself.

I think that that's one of the coolest errors

and faults in the human brain that could exist.

You know I think these imperfections,

I interpret them as an indication that the role of memory

is much less about being accurate representation of the past

and much more about being kind of a flexible compass

into the future.

[gentle music]

So what are you studying these days?

Well, I'm preparing my dissertation.

The general topic is going to be how we perceive

different types of social stimuli,

like different people's faces and make judgements about them

and how the way that we report on what we are experiencing

tells us about what's actually going on inside our heads.

What I love about what you were describing is like

you didn't use the word memory,

were how you were talking about kind of perceptions

and social judgments but I think probably we'd both agree

that memory is a big part of that.

Oh of course.

Right, like it reminds me so much of, you know,

what we in the field would refer to as statistical learning.

On one hand we might have like a one-shot memory,

a memory of something that we saw yesterday,

like what we did or what we ate or where we were.

But a lot of our memories and our knowledge

instead are based on many, many, many experiences.

Oh, absolutely.

I think this sort of reminds me of another project

that I'm doing.

It's fairly easy to get different participants to experience

consistent negative emotions to the same stimuli,

but with positive emotions it's so much harder to study.

I might not react the same to like this like cute cat video

than someone else.

And I definitely believe that people's memory

that they're bringing up unconsciously

when they're experiencing something to make

an emotional judgment informs especially our experience

with positive emotion possibly more than negative emotion.

Some of those examples really remind me also some of the

questions about kind of abnormalities in,

in memory or trauma or disruptions in memory

and how they also play out in terms of not just

what people remember but what they do with

those memories right?

As far as the way that my research plays into it

is like the first step in making a judgment

about what to do based on an experience we're calling from

memory is deciding what your emotional response was.

I think what we're still kind of trying to understand

as a field is the more kind of detailed

and bigger picture of where does this model live?

How does it get updated based on experiences?

Why does that sometimes happen and sometimes not?

There are actually people who are born

without a hippocampus.

They have disruptions to episodic memories.

They have trouble after this conversation remembering

what the conversation was about,

but they do have pretty good semantic information.

They have a good sense of knowledge about the world.

And that's interesting for two reasons.

One, it shows this association between the role of the

hippocampus and these two forms of memory,

episodic memories and semantic memory.

The other reason it's interesting is that people often

assume that we get to semantic memory

through episodic memory,

that we encounter one dog and then another dog,

and then another dog and then we learned the concept,

the semantic notion of a dog.

And these people, their profile suggests that you can

learn semantic information.

You can learn general knowledge about the world,

even without ever having the capacity

to build those individual memories.

In people with intact brains,

you might use a particular process,

but if that brain region that subserves that process

is damaged, that it's not that you can't do it anymore

you just now do it a different way.

Right.

It's really hard to tell people like,

just don't use your memory to do this.

And we just sort of have to infer

and guess at what strategies that they're doing.

Is there's a particular research question that the answer

you think is gonna inform the research in your lab

and perhaps in the rest of your field?

You know when I look back at,

some of the work for my own lab and in the field in general,

I really feel like some of the most exciting discoveries

were not an answer to a question that was around before,

but they were discoveries that made us realize

we weren't asking the right question.

I think one example of that even has to do with the

connection between memory and decision-making.

There was a discovery about how the striatum responds to

rewards and to learning that just all of a sudden flipped

the way we thought about the role of reward

and learning and memory,

and may force us to realize there was something

fundamentally connected between these processes.

And that discovery just raised a whole new set of questions

that didn't exist before.

Yeah, I guess then the trick is we need to be designing

studies that will make us most likely to find those sort of

unexpected things, which is kind of funny.

It's like how do you look for something that you don't know

what it is?

Each project should be very focused and rigorous

and know what a study is designed for.

But at the same time we have to keep our minds open,

our eyes open for what else is happening.

Some of the most interesting discoveries

didn't make sense at first.

As someone who is studying social phenomena

I like to hear that.

There you go, exactly.

[gentle music]

Thanks so much for coming, it's great to see you.

It's been a while.

It has been awhile, I'm really excited to be here.

It'd be great to just start by talking about your work

at the broadest level.

To my mind your work has really revolutionized the field

of cognitive neuroscience more broadly.

I've been really interested in how past understandings

of the brain have really focused on,

on pinpointing exactly what each piece of the brain does.

But I think that there's also a broader conversation

happening in the brain,

which is between one region and another.

So it's actually the pattern of connections between these

regions that would allow for the flow of information.

But I think the tools that have become widely available now

from the physics community and mathematics

and computer science are under the umbrella of,

of network science.

So that is a science of networks,

a science of understanding how bits of a system are

interconnected with one another.

Not just comparing two groups of people

or two kinds of two species,

but we can ask even within a single person,

how does the pattern of connectivity in my brain change

as we talk with one another?

How does the information flow change?

I think a lot about traffic on roadway networks

as a good example of this.

Which is, you know, we can understand where the roads are

and perhaps the roads are relatively fixed.

They change over long timescales

and it's similar to the brain.

We really only create large scale connections

over long timescales.

But we can alter the traffic on the roadways really easily.

And that's similar to what we do in the brain

is that we change the way that information is flowing

to allow us to respond to our environment.

It's a great analogy.

You know I remember when I first learned of your work,

for me as somebody who studies learning and memory,

which are processes that are all about rapid updating

that to me was really mind blowing that we can now

start asking questions about dynamics of circuits

on a timescale that's much closer to the timescale

of human thought than anything we had before.

The field is definitely opening up in the kinds of

questions that can be asked now with these approaches.

And I think what you're pointing out is that conceptually

it's where we wanted to go anyway.

So if there's so much orchestration that happens

and a symphony is not a single piece,

it's not a single pattern of,

of harmony between instruments and,

and similar to the brain,

symphony of your brain is not a single pattern.

It's a very dynamically changing pattern.

In the field we often talk of have having a mental model

that we use to make predictions about what's about to happen

and really use that to mean kind of a general understanding

of what's going on.

What does that look like in terms that come from your world

of like the configuration of, of a circuit?

I think this is the most exciting area of memory research

right now I think, which is how people build and remember,

you know, and keep with them models of the world

over long periods of time.

When I think about a mental model,

I think about ideas, potential outcomes, potential events,

potential actions, and how they all depend on one another.

So when we predict what will happen next it would be,

I am currently sitting at this piece of the network

and I know that there are,

there are these possible outcomes.

And so I have to get ready for those, you know,

four possible outcomes.

But that brings this interesting question to the fore,

I think which is how does a network system in our mind

and our brain create a network model of the world outside?

It's almost like there's a reflection in the structure of

what's inside in the hardware and what we're building

in a very abstract way.

And I think that relates to some interesting work that's

coming out about the hippocampus too.

We now think of the hippocampus so much in terms of memory

but really some of the earliest work in neuroscience

on the hippocampus talked about the role of the hippocampus

in spatial navigation.

And it really exposed I think one of the deepest questions

in memory research,

or at least from the neuroscience perspective is like,

well what is the connection?

What is the connection between

spatial processing and memory?

And why is it that neurons in the hippocampus

when an animal is navigating a maze,

why is it that there's spatial specialization there?

I really do think that this notion of a mental model,

a generative model is where those,

where memory and space meet.

That makes a lot of sense.

And I think that it makes me wonder how we think about

places in the abstract, what is a cognitive place, right?

And what is, how do we map out the cognitive spaces that we,

that our mind moves within in the same way

or in a similar way to the spaces

that we physically walk in.

But I think it opens a lot up,

a lot of questions about how individuals

make their own maps, right?

And then how the way that they choose to make that map

will then affect the way that they may respond in the future

to a new context or environment.

It's really interesting.

And I think it also really speaks to the kind of pervasive

and circular role of memory, right?

Because the maps are dependent on memories,

they're built from memories and experiences.

So there's this kind of dialogue with memory creating maps,

maps creating experiences, experiences creating memories,

affecting the maps,

and really makes me think even of a question

a friend asked me recently about moods and mental health

and this feeling of like how do some people get kind of

trapped in a state of mind where all they can see

is a particular way forward.

But then something happens in the world that shifts them

to another model.

Which is actually really interesting because you can make

different maps in different physical spaces too, right?

As you walk into a new room

you make a new map of that room.

So what are the doorways basically for mental models?

And I think that often we sort of fall into this pattern of,

of thinking about memory as, as always additive,

that we always just keep gathering more information

and update what we currently have.

We don't as often speak about deleting

pieces of information or,

or perceptions or something that we thought was a,

was a useful fact but actually it's not a fact.

Memories as models or models first

and memory as part of what helps build the model

starts generating new predictions.

Exactly the kind you just brought up

or other ways of thinking about things because an efficient

model needs to let go of information, right?

I just heard a colleague of mine joking about the fact that

the principles of neuroscience textbook

keeps growing and growing.

And that if we had enough strength

in theoretical neuroscience,

if our models of neuroscience were good enough,

that book should shrink back.

We know that memory retrieval is essentially construction.

And so you don't need to store all those separate memories.

You need to construct them.

But if you have a good model,

let go of all those details and just construct them

to feel as if it's a memory.

But really all you're doing is using the model

to fill the details.

It's kind of like the matrix, you know.

Right.

Getting way out there, but,

but it is a way in which if you have the right model,

it should be an efficient one.

I'm wondering what you, what you think about what all this

means for kind of a redefinition of what memory is,

in many ways a revision or expansion of that notion.

Would you be willing to try to help me think about

how to define it?

I think it's information certainly that,

that is stored in the brain

and that can then affect our behavior.

I think getting your behavior in there somewhere

seems, seems important.

But also is it just a record of the past or is it, you know,

our perceptions of, of what happened in the past,

or how we've changed how we think about that past event

or have we deleted that event completely

and then gathered this higher level structure

or mental model that then allows us to behave differently

in the future?

So it's more alive, it's more changing.

It's more, I think it's bubbling out and gathering,

gathering and growing and becoming more flexible,

but it's also sort of bubbling in,

in the sense of deleting and removing and forgetting.

So yes, I think that what we need to add perhaps

is that changeability and perhaps the behavioral relevance

of that changeability. I don't know, what do you think?

I agree.

I think, you know, as you were speaking I was thinking

maybe the most important word

to replace there is record.

Record implies an etching of something as it was.

And maybe what we need instead is that it's a model,

it's an approximation,

it's an abstraction that can help us create the illusion of

constructing your record.

But that it's the model that's the important thing

that drives the whole thing.

Yeah, yeah I agree.

I think that's perfect. Yep.

I hope you learned something about memory.

It plays a role in shaping the changing preferences

of things we encounter in our lives.

Memory is fundamental to everything we do, to who we are,

to what we order for breakfast,

to how we think about our past, to how we plan our future.",technology
"Benchmarks for Intel's upcoming Core i5-14600 (the non-K model) have leaked, detailing the CPU's boost clock speeds, multi- and single-threaded performance, and power consumption. X user @ECSM_Official shared screenshots of AIDA64, CInebench R23, and CPU-Z running on the Core i5-14600, and it seems like this lower-power chip is a 154-watt version of the Core i5-14600K, one of the best CPUs.

CPU clock speed and power data were measured during AIDA64's FPU stress test runt, which usually maxes out a CPU's power draw. Theoretically, this should confirm that the Core i5-14600 boosts to 4.8 GHz on its six P-cores and 3.9 GHz on its eight E-cores. A power consumption of 156 watts should also mean a TDP of 154 watts, which is what the Core i5-13600 is rated for.

*Specifications are unconfirmed

These frequency results don't make complete sense as the Core i5-14600's P-cores boost 200 MHz lower than the Core i5-13600's when the Core i5-14600 should be faster or at least tied. What's most likely happening here is that the Core i5-14600 runs at a lower frequency than it drops to in sustained workloads. The screenshot shows that the AIDA64 FPU benchmark has been running for nearly three minutes, well past the window for the 14600 to be running at its maximum clock speed.

We saw similar behavior in our Core i5-13400F review. Though rated for a 4.6 GHz boost frequency, it could only hit that clock speed briefly before declining to 4.1 GHz. That's likely what's happening with the Core i5-14600 in this AIDA64 test, and although that E-core clock speed should be accurate, we ought to expect the Core i5-14600 non-K to hit at most 5.3 GHz on its P-cores, and only for a short time.

Given that the Core i5-14600 is running lower core frequencies, a moderately lower score in Cinebench R23 is unsurprising. In the multi-threaded test, the Core i5-14600 was only about 90% as fast as the Core i5-14600K, but in the single-threaded test, this increased to 95% of the speed of the Core i5-14600K. Shaving off about 30 watts in power consumption would clarify this result when Intel launches the Core i5-14600 and other non-K 14th Gen SKUs. Still, it would make it possible to launch them at CES, given it's just around the corner. Retail samples of the Core i5-14600 are soon at hand.",technology
"One afternoon in early December of 2021, three years into the Mirai creators’ five years of probation, Shapiro invited Josiah, Paras, Dalton, and Elliott Peterson to speak to his Yale cybersecurity law class over Zoom. It would be the first time the four of them had appeared together in a semipublic setting other than a courtroom.

At first, Peterson did most of the talking, telling the story of the case and his investigation in a 45-minute presentation. Then he finished and the group took questions from the students.

One asked how this group of young adults with no criminal records had justified to themselves carrying out such epic acts of digital disruption. Paras answered for all of them, explaining how incremental it had all felt, how easy it had been to graduate from commandeering hundreds of hacked computers to thousands to hundreds of thousands, with no one to tell them where to draw the line. “There was never a leap,” he says. “Just one step after another.”

Another student asked how they had kept going for so long—how they believed they could evade the FBI even after they had been raided. This time it was Dalton who answered, overcoming his anxiety at speaking in front of crowds, in part thanks to better treatments that have helped to alleviate his stutter. He explained to the class that they had simply never faced an obstacle to their hacking careers that they hadn’t been able to surmount—that, like teenagers who have no experience of aging or death and therefore believe they’ll live forever, they had come to feel almost invincible.

Throughout the presentation, Shapiro says, he was struck by the youthful nervousness of the three Mirai creators and the fact that, even as they spoke, they never turned on their webcams. The hacker threat that he’d once been sure must be the Russians, that had felt so large and powerful, was just these “young boys,” he realized. “Young boys who don’t want to show their faces.”

Paras would later explain to me that he wasn’t exactly trying to hide. He just doesn’t want to associate his face with Mirai anymore. He’s since lost more than 30 pounds, ditched his glasses, grown a trim beard; he’d prefer to let his old image, the pudgy bespectacled kid pictured in Brian Krebs’ story about Anna-Senpai, be the one tied to Mirai.

As of the end of October, all three of the Mirai hackers’ periods of probation have ended. Paras Jha and Josiah White work together for a high-frequency financial trading company. Dalton Norman still holds his job working for Allison Nixon at Unit 221B. But they all plan to continue maintaining and updating Watchtower, perhaps their most lasting contribution to undoing some of the damage they’ve done.

“I’m grateful for the chance to try to put the genie back in the bottle,” Josiah says.

He also admits that’s probably impossible. Even now, he and Dalton and Paras know that fragments of the monster they built still haunt the internet. Mirai no longer comes from the future. Instead, it stubbornly hangs on from the past. Someday, they hope to leave it there.

"I really want to believe in ""8K sound"", even though that isn't a thing.

Resolution that refers to pixels per square inch doesn't translate aurally. Those who care about the quality of their music usually prefer the term 'hi-res audio', specified as anything above 1,411 kilobits per second, also known as 'CD-quality' 16-bit/44.1kHz. Audiophiles work in audio bit-depth and sampling frequency, not the number of pixels crammed into a horizontal display for visual crispness.

But Final Audio isn't alone in wanting to promote an ""evolution in sound quality"" via a bit of fresh terminology. Amazon Music refers to its top-tier streaming quality as ""HD"" (also not a thing in audio), while Apple Music prefers to put its improved audio propositions into 'Lossless' and 'Hi-Res Lossless' categories – which, although are very decent in quality, are again slightly misleading terms. Even Tidal isn't immune to a bit of slick wording, choosing to label its most expensive streaming quality 'Max' (which is actually up to 24-bit/192 kHz).

But let's stop talking about the hi-res chops within each of the best music streaming services and move on to Final's gorgeous looking new earbuds. Behold, the Final Audio ZE8000 MK2!

They're a surprizingly early update on the February 2023 issue inaugural ZE8000, but given the list of improvements and tweaks the company has made to them, an MK2 moniker is highly justified.

You now get (deep breath): new 'Shield Fin' eartips in five size options, which boast a 32% increase in isolation with ANC active and a more secure fit; software and hardware changes to improve the signal-to-noise ratio; the ability to deactivate ANC and all other noise control settings; a 5dB increase to the maximum volume, plus updates to the Final Connect app including improved 'Volume Step Optimization' and new multi-point connectivity.

And to say Final is a talented audio specialist is putting it mildly: see our five-star Final Audio UX3000 review if you need convincing of the company's prowess when cutting the wires from its listening gear.

Analysis: Final Audio has probably hit a home run here

A brutalist set of earbuds that's right up my street – on paper (Image credit: Final Audio )

If the first-gen ZE8000 received mixed reviews, the slightly underwhelming noise-cancellation (rather than the audio quality itself) seems to have been the main issue. And with Qualcomm aptX and aptX Adaptive both listed on the spec-sheet, on paper they're an accomplished listen.

We cannot vouch for the ZE8000 MK2 yet (although that is coming – I'll be reviewing them soon) but given the classy build and plethora of tips offered, achieving a good seal to maximise both the audio quality and the noise-cancellation may well be all the update they need.

That said, most of the contenders in best noise-cancelling earbuds guide can outlast Final's battery-life claim here, which is up to five hours from the buds or up to 15 hours including the case. The splendid Technics EAH-AZ80 can go for up to seven hours before needing a charge and up to 25 hours with the case; the entry-level Sony WF-C700N equal Final's 15-hour total but offer seven and a half hours from the buds themselves.

How good will the updated app, new tips, tweaks under the hood and software upgrades prove under intense review? Time will tell, but if you simply can't wait, the Final Audio ZE8000 MK2 are available from today (December 8) priced $399 / £289 (which is around AU$609) from Amazon and selected retailers worldwide.",technology

Our review awards

TechRadar has four product awards:

(Image credit: Future)

Editor's Choice award

The Editor's Choice award goes to any product that gets a 5-star TechRadar review in accordance with our reviews guarantee.

Great Value award

The Great Value award is given to products that represent excellent value for money are thus worthy of consideration. This is not awarded alongside an Editor's Choice or Best in Class award, as excellent value for money is part of the criteria for those awards.

Best in Class award

This award goes to the best product in any major reviews category.

Recommended award

A product that scores 4-stars or above is eligible to be considered for the Recommended award. While the product may be lacking in certain areas, it still demonstrates enough quality to be wholeheartedly recommended.

Our hands-on reviews

We headline two different types of article with the word 'review' - 'hands-on reviews' and 'full product reviews.' It is important to distinguish between them.

Hands-on reviews are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours.

The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

We use the word 'review' here partly because we are giving a real opinion based on using it, and partly because readers increasingly use the word 'review' in searches when looking for these early views about a product.

However, hands-on reviews are not the same as full product reviews. Our full product reviews are always based on the finished release product, which has been thoroughly tested and benchmarked and will always contain a full verdict and score.

Our reviewers

Our reviewers are specialists, each with expertise in a particular technology. With decades of combined experience reviewing technology under their belts, our team has consistently lived, breathed, and reviewed technology since TechRadar's conception in 2007.

Our US Editor-in-Chief, Lance Ulanoff, has more than 30 years of experience as a technology journalist at a number of high-profile outlets, including Mashable and PCMag, and UK Editor-in-Chief Marc McLaren has more than 20 years of tech publishing experience on sites that include Tom's Guide and Stuff.

However, that just scratches the surface of a diverse and far-reaching global team that spans four continents, 14 countries, and 11 different languages.

The result is a team with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the areas they cover, ensuring our reviews not only give you an in-depth experience of each product but also the vital wider context, providing you with the exact information you need when it comes to making a buying decision.

Specialist expertise

Because our writers are specialists, they are constantly in touch with the communities they report on. That means our experts are able to rate products against others of the same type.

TechRadar commissions our reviews only from those with the requisite level of expertise: from our own team of writers to other external experts when needed.

What this means is if you see a review of a home theater system on TechRadar, you know it's been reviewed by an expert in home theater, not mobile phones.

"If you want to understand what your Apple Vision Pro spatial computing experience will be like, you need to look at the upcoming apps. Oh, right, there, are none yet. That means we're left to look to developers and, no surprise, even they have questions about what it means to develop for Apple's newest computing and digital experience platform.

A few weeks ago, I asked about a dozen developers if they were excited about building apps for the Vision Pro. Most said yes and some were even willing to imagine what those app experiences might be like.

We're still months from the consumer release of Apple's mixed-reality headset and while I've tried it a couple of times, a true understanding of what it will be like to play, communicate, explore, and even work in the headset remains elusive. That conversation I had with the developers reminded me of that much. None had a real concrete idea of exactly how to compute inside a Vision Pro or how they might be building applications designed to work on the new visionOS platform.

There are, it seems, several common questions developers have when it comes to building apps for Vision Pro and all of them are asked and answered in a recent Apple Developers blog post entitled Q&A: Spatial design for visionOS, which is based on a Q+A the Apple design team held with developers in June at WWDC23 (where Apple first unveiled Vision Pro and visionOS).

Even though I'm not a developer I could relate to all of the developers' burning visionOS questions and found Apple's answers illuminating and, in some cases, surprising.

Start slow

Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that is capable of virtually a complete pass-through view that puts AR elements in your real world, or of complete immersion. The latter, which I experienced, is impressive, especially for the way it can put a virtual version of your hands (but not your knees) inside the experience.

For developers, though, knowing where in the spectrum of immersion to place users can be daunting. Apple does not recommend that these apps fully immerse users, at least at the start.

""We generally recommend not placing people into a fully immersive experience right away – it’s better to make sure they’re oriented in your app before transporting them somewhere else,"" says Apple in the post.

Apple also recommends that visionOS developers create a ground plane to connect their apps with the real world. Indeed, most of the time you'll probably be using Vision Pro in passthrough or mixed reality mode, which means that having a connection to the real floor under your feet will help, well, ground the app and keep it from feeling disorienting.

The moment

Apple Vision Pro interface (Image credit: Apple)

There was a moment in my first Vision Pro experience when a virtual butterfly (that looked real) fluttered from a windowed forest space onto my finger. It was stunning and unforgettable.

It appears Apple wants developers to think about such moments in their apps. No, Apple's not recommending everyone add a butterfly (although that would be wonderful). Instead, Apple tells developers to think about how their apps can shine in spatial computing. It is, as Apple puts it, ""an experience that isn’t bound by a screen.""

In one demo I saw, the key moment was clearly when a dinosaur emerged from the wall in front of me, but Apple notes in the post that key moments can be something as simple as adding a focus mode that includes spatial audio in a writing app.

3D challenges

(Image credit: Apple)

In Vision Pro, you're no longer computing on a flat plane. Everything is in 3D and that requires a new way of working with display elements. Apple solves this in visionOS by applying gaze and gesture control. In the post, Apple reminds developers to think about that 3D space when developing apps.

""Things can get more complex when you’re designing elements in 3D, like having nearby controls for a faraway element,"" explained Apple Designers.

In general, developing apps for visionOS will be more complex. Instead of just thinking about how mousing over to an on-screen element might work, developers must think about what happens when someone wearing Vision Pro looks at an element. I remember being impressed with how every experience in Vision Pro always knew exactly where I was looking and how buttons and windows changed based on my gaze.

Comfort is the thing

(Image credit: Apple)

Spatial computing involves more of your body than traditional computing. First of all, you're wearing a headset. Second, you're looking around to see wraparound environments and apps. Finally, you're using your hands and fingers to control and engage with the interface.

Apple, though recommends that developers do not spread the main content all over what could be a 360-degree window.

""Comfort should guide experiences. We recommend keeping your main content in the field of view, so people don't need to move their neck and body too much. The more centered the content is in the field of view, the more comfortable it is for the eyes,"" wrote Apple designers in the post.

I do recall that while some of my Vision Pro experiences felt immersive, I wasn't whipping my head back and forth to find controls and track action.

A sound decision

Key to my Vision Pro experience was the sound, which uses spatial audio to create a 360-degree soundstage. But it's not just about the immersive experience. Apparently, sound can be used to help connect Vision Pro wearers to their spatial computing experiences.

In the post, Apple reminds developers who may not have thought much about sound before to use audio cues in their apps, noting that ""an audio cue helps [users] recognize and confirm their actions.""

I don't know exactly what it will be like to live and work in the world of spatial computing, but Apple's guidance is quickly bringing things into focus.",technology
"Transcript

I'm Brian Greene, and today I have been challenged

to explain a topic in five levels of difficulty.

We're going to be talking about the nature of time,

the most familiar and the most mysterious quality

of the physical universe.

There is nothing that we experience

that does not take place in some duration of time.

So if you can understand time,

you're on your way to understanding reality.

[rapid music]

Hello? Hello.

What's your name?

Kayla.

How old are you, Kayla?

I am nine years old.

So if you are nine years old,

what does that mean about the earth?

How many times has it gone around the sun?

Nine times.

Nine times.

So there's a relationship between motion through space,

the earth is going through space, and the passage of time.

They're kind of connected

Yeah. in some way.

But there are differences, right?

If I asked you to move through space,

you could do it freely, right?

Can you get up?

And let's see how easy it is to move through space.

Can you move over to that location?

And can you come back?

Anything getting in your way?

Easy to do?

Yep.

If I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space,

can you do that?

I mean, hold perfectly still.

That's good.

But if I ask you to hold still in time,

to not go to the next second or the next second,

can you do that?

No.

So there's definitely this difference

between space and time, some fundamental quality

that distinguishes how freely we can move through space

versus how freely we can move through time.

Have you heard of Albert Einstein?

Yes.

What do you know about him?

He has crazy hair.

He does have crazy hair, and I think I'm maybe heading

in that direction actually.

He showed us an approach to travel to the future.

You want me to tell you how you do it?

Okay.

You build a spaceship.

You go out into space really quickly.

You turn around and you come back to planet Earth,

and he showed us that when you're on that ship,

your clock will tick off time more slowly.

You will age more slowly.

So that journey may only take you, say, a year,

six months out and six months back,

but you know what?

When you step out of the ship,

it'll be 100 years into the future or 1,000 years,

a million years into the future.

Would you do that if you could?

I would probably be dead by then.

No, you'd be alive, that's the amazing thing.

I'd be dead.

Everybody else would be dead who stayed on earth,

but your body would only age one year,

and yet it would be 1,000 years into the future.

The question though is, could you get back?

And I don't know the answer to that, nobody does.

We don't know if you can travel back,

but we certainly know that you can travel forward.

Has anyone ever tried to go forward and back?

I don't think so.

That same guy with the crazy hair, Albert Einstein,

showed that there's actually a limit

to how fast things can go.

And you know what the limit limit is?

The limit is the speed of light,

because light travels 671 million miles per hour,

that is fast enough to go around the entire earth

seven times in one second.

So if we could build a spaceship that would go

as fast as light, we'd be able to do what Einstein noted.

There's something else that's really curious about time.

Things tend to go in one direction,

and we call it the arrow of time.

It sort of points from the past

into what we call the future.

If you're to ask me why is there an arrow to time, ask me.

Why is there an arrow to time?

I'm not really sure.

I have some ideas, but I'd say

we've still not completely nailed it down.

Kayla, what have you learned about time

from talking about it here?

That you can't really travel back through time.

And can you travel to the future in principle?

Maybe.

Maybe, that's absolutely right.

I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past,

but it's not been ruled out.

That's kind of exciting

that it's still at least an open possibility.

Yeah.

[rapid music]

If I was to ask you what is time, what would you say?

Well, time is kind of strange

because it's almost a man-made idea.

There is the tangible of, you know,

how the Earth revolves around the sun

or how we orbit around ourselves,

it's almost in a way, does it exist

if the way that we measure it is manmade?

Before there was any life on planet Earth,

I think we all agree the universe existed.

Yeah.

Did things change before there was life on Earth?

Yes.

And how would you talk about that change

without invoking this concept of time?

It's difficult to talk about something

without adding time into it.

Even if it is a human-made concept

that the universe evolved, developed,

changed through time, ultimately giving rise

to galaxy, stars, planets,

and on this particular planet, life.

That conception of time gives a feel

that it's like universal, that it's out there,

it's the same for everybody.

It's independent of our actions or activities.

Do you know that Albert Einstein shattered

that view of time?

He found that if you and I, say,

have identical wrist watches, I'm sitting still

and I'm watching you move, I will find that your clock

is taking off time more slowly than my clock.

But you know what's really remarkable?

You can figure out this quality of time

if you know one fact, that the speed of light is constant.

Have you ever heard that phrase?

Yeah, my freshman year physics class.

Yeah, if you're clever,

you can use that with high school algebra,

maybe even a little high school trigonometry

to make it even easier,

to derive that clocks take off time at different rate.

Do you want me to show you how that goes?

Yes, please.

All right, so to figure out the effect of motion on time,

I'm gonna use a really simple clock,

it's called a light clock.

It's two mirrors that are facing each other.

And what we do is we have a little ball of light

called a photon, right?

That goes up, hits the top mirror,

then comes back down and hits the bottom mirror.

And every time it does that, they go tick-tock,

that's one unit of time.

Imagine now, we have another one of these light clocks,

but I'm gonna have it in motion.

Now what do you notice about that path?

It's much longer.

It's much longer, right?

This one's going tick-tock, tick.

This is gonna go tick, tock.

In fact, we can figure out the ratio.

Let's consider time on the stationary clock

compared to time on this moving clock.

Well, that ratio is gonna be the ratio of the lengths.

Then this would be given by D over L.

More time on the stationary

because it's longer distance on the moving clock.

Well, this length over here,

that's the same as this L over here, right?

So we want D over L.

Now, you may have recall that in trigonometry,

there's a name for L over D.

Sine of theta, opposite is L, hypotenuse is D, right?

And so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta.

So if we can figure out 1 over sine theta,

we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time

and the stationary clock to time on the moving clock,

we just need one other fact.

The speed of light along this diagonal

is equal to what we call C.

C equals speed of light.

But in order for this ball of light

to hit that point on the mirror,

the component of the speed of light

in the horizontal direction better be keeping perfect pace

with the speed of the clock itself.

So let's assume that this clock is moving

in this direction with the speed equal to V.

So C times cosine theta must be equal to

the speed of the clock in motion.

And from this, we learn that cosine theta

is equal to V over C.

There's another beautiful identity you may recall

from your study of trigonometry,

that sine-squared theta plus cosine-squared theta

is equal to 1.

This is really just a Pythagorean theorem in disguise.

And from that, we can now solve

for a sine-squared theta equals 1 minus V over C squared.

And therefore sine theta is the square root of this.

And now, we're basically done

because we already had over here that this ratio

is 1 over sine theta, which now is 1 over the square root

of 1 minus V over C squared.

So you see, as V gets very close to C,

this gets very close to 1.

1 minus something very close to 1 is very close to 0.

1 over something close to 0 is huge,

which means the ratio of time on the stationary

to time on the moving, that can be a huge number

as the speed of the moving clock

approaches the speed of light.

Now I did this for a light clock,

but it's true for any clock, and this is what Einstein

discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity.

Do you think that in the near or foreseeable future

of humans, as we know ourselves now,

will there be a time where we are using these formulas

and these concepts in our daily lives?

As technology progresses,

the barrier between the limitations of experience

and the truth of how the world behaves

in extreme environments will be moved

in the very same way that, you know,

we can toss a pack of gum

and we know where to put our other hand to catch it.

Will we have that kind of intuition about these ideas?

I think it's quite possible.

[rapid music]

What are you studying right now?

I'm doing physics and computer science.

So have you spent any time

thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics,

that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws

between forward in time and backward in time?

Is that something you're familiar with?

Yeah, and the one thing that really confuses me there,

I'm thinking about one of the most basic things we learn,

I guess, from Interstellar

is that the universe is expanding,

or space is expanding. Yeah.

And so I'm thinking how does that square with gravity

and electromagnetism, which is like kind of predicated

on the density of charges or masses.

The fact that space expands is perfectly compatible

with our understanding of all the forces of nature

because all of them continue to operate

in a somewhat more subtle way,

but we have a beautiful prescription

for taking any law that we understand in the simpler context

of flat space time and juicing it up

so that it works in a curved space time.

The more philosophical question

is in any of those formulations.

If you replace T by -T,

and you do it properly in the equations,

the equations still work.

But if past and future are kind of treated on equal footing

in the fundamental equations, why are they so different

from the perspective of experience?

And when you're talking about the perspective experience,

is that just human subjective experience

or actual observation for physics?

Well, certainly it starts

with human subjective experience, but then we are able

to elevate it to a more objective description,

for instance, when we introduce words like disorder

and order, and entropy

in the second law of thermodynamics.

And the equation, usually the way we say it,

is S equals K log W,

entropy equals Boltzmann constant times log

of a particular quantity, which is ultimately counting

the number of distinct configurations

that a system can be in.

What Boltzmann and others showed is that entropy

tends to increase toward the future.

But the key word there is tends to increase.

So this arrow of time going from the past to the future

rests on a curious foundation.

It's a statistical foundation,

which says that it's more likely for eggs

to splatter than unsplatter.

It's more likely for glasses to smash than unsmash,

but not that it's impossible for things to happen.

You just have to wait a really long time

for there to be a reasonable chance of it ever taking place.

When you said that, you know,

it's more likely for an egg to smash or for glass to smash,

and that's probably because there's so many atoms,

so much stuff going on. Yes.

But I'm thinking if we zoom in on,

like a single thing, I guess,

do we have variations that are extremely unintuitive

because, you know, things can happen in a way

that isn't the statistical average?

If I take a film of that electron,

and it's a little fanciful to describe it

that language because you know

about quantum mechanics and so forth,

but I take a film of a little particle moving around,

and I show you that film,

you'll be really hard-pressed to determine

whether I've shown you the film running

forward in time or whether I've shown you

the film going in reverse time.

If I had two, or three, or four,

or a gazillion particles into the mix,

then it will be much easier for you to determine

whether the film is going forward in time

or backward in time.

But order and disorder don't have much meaning

if there's only one particle.

And that's why the fundamental laws

don't draw a distinction,

but the macroscopic experience does,

but it raises a key question.

Where'd the order of the egg come from?

If everything goes toward disorder,

how did I get this orderly collection of atoms

called an egg?

Well, you probably would say from--

Chicken. A chicken.

But then I say to you, where'd the chicken come from?

And you'd say from an egg.

But there's actually some real insight

we can draw from this, because if we keep going back

with the chicken and egg story,

we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of life,

we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the galaxy,

and ultimately, the universe,

each step taking us to greater and greater order.

So we believe that the ultimate source of order

is the Big Bang itself.

Highly ordered beginning called the Bang,

and we have been living through the degradation

of that order ever since.

We still don't really have a solid explanation

for why the Big Bang had to be or was, highly ordered.

At the moment, it's really a deep assumption.

Back with Einstein, you know, we wondered,

does time change with speed?

And that's another change with

that before, we didn't think possible,

but I guess we found out eventually

some of the fanciful ideas.

I guess it's just tiny sliver of hope that.

Yeah, not only did we find that time changes

with speed in special relativity,

but we also found that time changes with gravity.

Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks

slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field,

or gravitational potential actually,

that it is experiencing.

I think you mentioned the Interstellar before.

Yeah.

Do you remember the scene in Interstellar?

They're going to a planet that's near a black hole.

They go down to the planet,

and they spend just a couple hours there,

but when they go back to the ship,

it's 23 years later on the ship

because time is elapsing slowly

near the strong gravitational field,

comparatively quickly far away.

And that's not science fiction,

that's actually how time behaves.

I've always heard people say,

Oh, general relativity, you know,

it might not seem applicable.

But GPS, due to satellites,

we could synchronize those clocks

by accounting for relativity.

Well, but that's even a really, really good point.

The GPS would become completely inaccurate

in a very short period of time if the satellites

weren't taken account of, or the software

wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses

differently for the clocks on the satellite

compared to the clocks down here on earth.

So we walk around with general relativity in our pockets

even though most of us perhaps don't really know that.

[rapid music]

Have you started any projects yet, or that's?

I am just starting one right now.

What's it on?

I'm trying to figure out how stars in the galaxy

are moving based on what they're made of,

which is interesting.

Oh, clearly, time comes in to what you're doing.

To what extent do you have to grapple

with some of the subtle features of time?

Yeah, with my research in particular,

I've really want to know what happened in the past

and what happened in the future,

but you only get a single snapshot

when you look up at the night sky.

Right, but if it's sufficiently far back, you're--

Great, and so we can learn a lot

by looking at other galaxies and seeing

what they were doing in their present, I suppose.

Yeah.

Just figuring out what's gonna happen next

is part of the issue.

That's looking into the future, I suppose.

And so have you taken general relativity,

or you taken that now, or?

I took a course on general relativity, yeah.

But you learned about black holes?

Sure.

One of the weird things and wonderful things

about wormholes is that they are tunnels, if you will,

shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space.

But once you have a shortcut from here to there,

the beautiful thing is, if you move the openings,

time will elapse differently at the different openings.

So there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines.

Go one direction, you're going into the future,

go the other direction, you'd be going into the past.

But that, of course, raises philosophical and logical--

Paradoxes.

yeah, absolutely. paradoxes and sort.

So what do you think, what do you?

[both laughs]

I throw it to you.

Yeah, I've heard a few different theories

that people posit.

Like maybe it is back to the future,

and you really change your own universe.

I've also heard people say

that you could have multiple universes spawned

from this event or something along these lines.

Yeah, if you are going to be able to change the past,

that's the one that resonates most with me.

I think the same.

Yeah, so you go into the past,

and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting,

but you're preventing them from meeting

in the parallel reality, which means

that you will never be born in that reality,

but the origin of your birth is still completely understood,

it was in the universe from which you originated.

Another one that's more subtle is,

the laws of physics may prevent you from interceding.

Right.

And that raises uncomfortable issues

for many people having to do with like free will.

I'm immediately uncomfortable.

Yeah, so that one,

there's actually some people like Joe Polchinski

who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables,

where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole,

comes out and hits the very ball

that was going into the hole.

And in that way, if it could knock it off course,

we seem to be in some logical paradox.

Absolutely.

But the finding was, the ball can come out

and just sort of graze the other one,

but it can't affect it enough

to prevent the sequence of events from happening.

And the way I like to think about it frankly is

if there's one universe, not parallel universes

like in the other solution, moments in time just are.

They don't change,

the whole point of time is the variable

along which change can happen.

So if you have the atoms of time, the individual events,

there's no conception of them changing.

So whatever collection of influences were in play

that allowed your parents to meet,

they will always be in play

because you were always part of that moment.

Do you think travel back to the past is impossible

because of a deep physical, like mathematical reasoning,

or just because of all of these problems

that yet you've been talking about?

I suspect that when we've fully understand the mathematics

of the final physical laws, if we ever come upon them,

I think there's gonna be something built in

that prevents this kind of free travel to the past.

But sometimes I wonder if that's just coming

from a more emotional place

where I sort of want the world to be safe

from this kind of paradoxes.

So what's pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical

proposals for traveling to the past

that have come out of physics,

you can't travel to a moment in the past

before the first time travel machine is built.

Sure, you know the twin paradox?

[Brian] Yeah, sure.

Where, you know, you fly off,

looks like you're moving fast,

but to you, it looks like the other guy's moving fast

so who actually ages more?

Who ages less?

A resolution I've heard is that

because you have to be going away and then coming back,

you had to accelerate at some point,

and this breaks the ambiguity.

Yeah.

What if, say, the universe isn't flat?

What if the universe is curved, and you go off

in one direction and then you come back

in the same direction, you pass by the Earth,

who's older then?

Do we have an answer?

Yeah, we do have an answer.

So the simplest version of that is,

imagine that the universe has a shape of a donut.

Imagine I'm on the circular part of this donut universe.

All right.

And imagine I turn on two laser beams,

sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left.

And these beams will go around the entirety of space,

and they'll both come back, and at some point,

they will hit me.

Imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective.

Now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame

of reference, say, to my left, they do the same experiment.

They fire the beam of light left and right.

Notice that the beam that they fire to their left

will have to travel farther to reach them

because they're moving away from it.

Whereas the beam that they fired to their right

will not have to travel as far

because in some sense, they're moving toward it.

The two beams of light will not hit that moving observer

at the same moment.

To you or to them?

To them.

Wow.

Which means that there's a preferred frame of reference

in this universe.

Everybody is not on equal footing

Fascinating. as they are when we teach

to freshmen the special theory of relativity.

That's right, exactly. Me, for example.

No, everybody else is moving relative to me,

and it's real motion.

So everybody else will be like the moving twin.

They will be younger and I will be older.

And when you think about past and future

on a cosmological scale, there was a long period

when there were no human beings in the universe.

The fact of the matter is there will be

these two long stretches

with our presence being sort of a flicker in between,

does that thought inform anything

about how you live in your brief flicker

within that brief flicker?

I rage against thinking like that.

Too defeatist?

I think it's too defeatist.

I think that's the perfect way to put it.

Because it might be a brief flicker

on a single moat of dust like floating

in a cosmic eternity.

[Brian] Yep.

But it's everything.

There's nothing else that I'll ever experience.

And so in a way, there's nothing else to me.

Yeah, yeah.

There's an eternity, but I'm never gonna see it,

I'm never gonna feel it.

It can be debilitating to imagine

an eternal future of sort of nothing,

where none of what we do sort of persist.

On the other hand, if you flip your perspective around

and say, How remarkable is it

that we have this brief moment that allows us to think

and feel and love and explore and illuminate,

wow, how wonderful is that?

Yeah.

[rapid music]

So often, when we try to give the basic idea

of what time is, I'm fond of saying,

Look, space is the language that allows us

to say where events take place,

and time is the language that allows us to specify

when they take place.

Where would you jump off from there

and trying to give a deeper understanding

of the basics of time?

Maybe part of the distinction in between time and space,

it's that you have a clear irreversible evolution.

So how to explain what time is,

well, it's a parameter that is measured by clocks.

I mean, at the end, this is what we know.

And allows us to talk about change.

And also that we know how to describe

in terms of some set of equations.

Which gives a clear sense of causality.

Yep.

To note our recent paper,

where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas

of special relativity, but in a setting

where the global shape of the space time,

we imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space,

a circular dimension and thought about

how special relativity works in that setting,

we came to a result in this very basic setting.

You can send signals into the past,

not in a way that will violate causality.

Did that surprise you, that by going from the usual topology

that doesn't have a closed part of space,

but making that one change,

you could have this radical impact?

I found quite surprising that you could have

this exotic behavior of signal propagation

in a system that was extremely simple,

totally classical, there was nothing weird

except one dimension that was compactified,

was identified on a circle.

Actually, even the standard vanilla causal structure

of special relativity

may give some very unexpected behaviors

when you combine it with other simple modifications

of just the flat space time.

And the beauty of it is, it is not like

there is some high-powered mathematical methodology,

straightforward algebra that a high school kid

would know is all that you need

to extract these unusual results.

And they were unusual because

even if you do not violate causality,

we discovered that a fast-moving observer,

that could be us on a rocket, could send signals

very far and then back in a very small time.

And so the old idea that of course we always hear about,

that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life,

if they're far away, we can't really have a conversation

because we'll say hello,

and then like 10,000 years or 100,000 years later,

they'll answer us 'cause they'll take that long

for the signals.

But at least in this setup, which we don't know

is true about our universe, but if it were,

then you could have a real-time conversation

over arbitrarily large distances, which is--

That was unexpected.

And so that shows how even ideas

that seem to be well-settled and well-understood

have surprises.

Like, why didn't Einstein realize this?

Yeah, maybe the idea of living on a subspace,

of being confined in this extra dimension on a surface,

may have been looked exotic

but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s.

Many people have begun thinking about the possibility

that space and time may be so-called emergent

quantities that they're not as fundamental as perhaps

Newton or Einstein would've thought.

Where do you stand on that idea?

It seems not unthinkable.

Saying that something is emergent will make full sense

only when we have some concrete model

in which space and time emergent,

in which we make sense of this non-space,

non-time description of a theory.

I don't know if we are still at this stage

in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario

because, often, I tell my students,

the greatest scientific revolution

has been not in the 20th century,

has not been quantum mechanics nor general relativity

nor special relativity, that's been the passage

from qualitative description of nature,

the quantitative one.

When you pass from asking how to how much,

then you understand something.

And who do you credit with that?

Is that Newton?

Do you go Newton or a little bit below?

Do you Galileo? I would say Galileo, Newton.

Of course, the completion of this idea is Newton.

One of the things that relativity also sheds a light on

is what exists, that if someone's moving relative to me,

what they consider now might be in my past,

what they consider now might be in my future,

which would suggest that all

of time exists much as we're willing

to accept that all of space exists.

Is that cold water?

Actually, it resonates with me for various reasons.

One is that, professionally,

we use spacetime diagrams, Penrose diagrams,

a lot of diagrams where space and times

are just two axis on a board.

And when we describe a particle,

we have a line that goes up in time.

By the way, this image also is the last image in Pros,

the last page, there is this beautiful sentence,

which is also true, saying that if he has the time,

he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings

that extending time much longer than in space.

If C equal to 1, that's very true.

So this idea that you have a continuum,

and time should not be made to disappear

as soon as it's gone, is very practical.

It's also what is behind the idea of histories

in quantum mechanics.

When in the approach of various people including

Hartle that collaborated a lot with Hawking.

There is this idea that what you describe is a history,

it's not a particular moment in time, but it's an evolution.

This history treats space and time on a more equal basis.

But would you say there's more to it than the technical,

more to it than the diagrams,

more to it than sort of an interpretation

of the mathematical equations?

would you go so far as to take solace in the fact that,

in a sense that you will always exist

because you will always be at the moments of space and time

that you have occupy throughout your life?

Well, actually, that's probably the only way

in which you can take solace because all the rest,

right, is almost children's stories.

Yeah.

I mean, of course, it's something that you come

by yourself, and you arrive at this conclusion,

which is totally not objective and is part

of your personal history by yourself,

but it was interesting to see that, for instance,

Kurt Vonnegut had exactly the same take.

He said, no, I mean the only thing

that really makes you not fear what will happen

or your own mortality is that every instant

is a turn of instances,

exactly as each point in space is nothing, space disappears.

It will always be there.

Yeah, the idea that something is irretrievable

maybe is an accident, and we go back again

to all the initial conditions in which we started.

Absolutely.

[gentle music]

From this discussion of time,

I hope that you have appreciated the subtlety

and the richness of this quality of the world

that we experience all the time.

Thanks so much for watching.",technology
"Streaming services are known for having award-worthy series but also plenty of duds. Our guide to the best TV shows on Netflix is updated weekly to help you figure out which series you should move to the top of your queue. They aren’t all surefire winners—and we love a less-than-obvious gem—but they’re all worth your time.

Feel like you’ve watched everything on this list? Try our guides to the best movies on Netflix for more options. And if you’ve already completed Netflix and are in need of a new challenge, check out our picks for the best shows on Amazon Prime and the best Disney+ series.

Bodies

Four detectives. Four time periods. Four murders? Maybe—but only one body. This time-twisting thriller—adapted from the comic of the same name by writer Si Spencer and artists Tula Lotay, Meghan Hetrick, Dean Ormston, and Phil Winslade—hops from Victorian London to a dystopian future and back again, as the same corpse is found in the same spot in each era. The only thing stranger than the impossible crime itself is the conspiracy behind it, one that spans decades, impacting and linking every figure investigating the body. A brilliantly high-concept sci-fi crime drama, Bodies is one of the best one-and-done limited series to hit Netflix in years.

Pluto

Think you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential ""The Greatest Robot on Earth"" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses.

Blue Eye Samurai

In the 17th Century, Japan enforced its ""sakoku"" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.

Dark

If you like your TV moody and brooding, the sci-fi series Dark is for you. The first German-language Netflix original series (there’s an option for English dubbing, though the original language version is superior), Dark opens with a secret liaison, a missing teenager and a spooky-looking cave, which rather sets the vibe for the rest of the show. What initially appears to be a straightforward mystery investigation soon turns into an ambitious time travel plot with bucket loads of atmosphere. A tight 26 episodes, spread over three seasons, the more you watch, the more you see how appropriate the title is.

Sex Education

Talking about sex with your parents is always awkward, but for teenager Otis (Asa Butterfield) it's even worse: His mother Jean (a captivating Gillian Anderson) is a renowned sex therapist who won't stop talking about sex, leaving Otis himself ambivalent toward it. Still, something must have sunk in, and after helping a fellow student navigate a sexual conundrum, Otis finds himself almost accidentally running his own sex therapy clinic on campus. While the situations are often played for laughs, over its four seasons Sex Education thoughtfully explores intimacy, sexuality, and relationships in tender and even profound ways. With a fantastic ensemble cast including incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa as Otis' best friend Eric and Emma Mackey as love interest Maeve, this UK-set and Welsh-filmed coming-of-age dramedy has proven itself one of Netflix's best series.

The Fall of the House of Usher

Time for our favorite Halloween tradition: a new Mike Flanagan horror miniseries, a staple of spooky season since 2021's Midnight Mass. This year, Flanagan treats viewers to not just an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's title work, but rather several of the master of macabre's pieces, brilliantly woven into a tapestry of terror. Like the title's source, this eight-episode event hangs on twin siblings Roderick and Madeline Usher, here reimagined as the rulers of a shady pharmaceutical empire, now with a sprawling family of descendants and squabbling heirs. The fun twist is that each member of the Usher clan is adapted from characters found in Poe's other works, including The Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Masque of the Red Death, and, of course, The Raven. As the characters start falling victim to a variety of unsettling deaths, leaving the family founders to watch in despair as their empire crumbles, Poe fans will delight in spotting the references. It's not just for grown-up goths or erudite emos though—everyone will get a creepy kick out of this delectably gothic twist on Succession.

Hellbound

Imagine a supernatural figure appears and tells you precisely when you are going to die—what would you do? Now imagine if this wasn't a one-off personal experience, but society as a whole were aware of such warnings from beyond. How do you think the world would react? Forget the trio of giant smoke demons bursting into reality to drag foretold victims to hell, the societal shifts are the real hook of this striking South Korean horror series from Train to Busan director Yeon Sang-ho. With the series split into two arcs—one set in 2022, the other in 2027—it delves into complex theological issues such as the nature of sin and humanity's propensity to put faith in all the wrong places, making for one of the most innovative horror shows in years.

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina

Adapted from the horror comic of the same name—itself a disturbingly dark reimagining of the light-hearted Archie Comics character—Chilling Adventures of Sabrina sees Kiernan Shipka as half-human, half-witch teenager Sabrina Spellman, caught between the mortal and supernatural worlds as she navigates her dual heritage. With four seasons to its run, it's the first season that most lives up to the ""chilling"" moniker, diving deep into satanic imagery and lore and exploring themes of determinism and inevitability as Sabrina weighs up whether to sign her name—and soul—in the Book of the Beast. Frequently unsettling, it's the closest to true horror the show comes, while later seasons up the camp factor and delve into schlocky territory, with warring witch clans, mystic doppelgängers, and an extremely meta fourth season that manages to fit in cameos from the 1990s Sabrina the Teenage Witch sitcom. It's never less than thoroughly entertaining popcorn horror though—and with Michelle Gomez at her scene-stealing best as the gloriously vampy Madame Satan throughout the show, it's perfect for a Halloween marathon.

Disenchantment

Netflix screwed up the pitch on Disenchantment. Coming from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, it was presented in opposition to his later Futurama, lazily swapping sci-fi for fantasy. Go in with that expectation and you'll be disappointed—this is a far more structured and arc-based show. Over the course of five seasons, it charts the journey of Princess Bean, who yearns to be free from her royal obligations to Dreamland, taking her from drunken troublemaker to reluctant hero. Incredibly reluctant. ""Would rather stay a drunken troublemaker"" reluctant. With the aid of her personal demon, Luci, and a besotted elf bestie named Elfo, Bean flips the kingdom on its head, unearths ancient secrets, and battles her greatest enemy: her mom. A far cry from the gag-a-minute approach of its creator's predecessors, Disenchantment can be a bit of a slow burn at times, but with its drier comedy and rejection of an episodic status quo, it's one of the most interesting adult animated comedies to come out of the US in years.

Gamera Rebirth

Gamera has never enjoyed the same respect that fellow kaiju Godzilla has. While the latter has earned the epithet ""King of the Monsters"" and movie franchises in both its native Japan and in the US, Gamera is perhaps best known as the subject of loving ridicule on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Here's a secret though: Gamera is rad. He's a giant, fire-breathing turtle with an impenetrable shell, and who can both fly and become a flame-spewing, razor-edged, aerial spinning top of doom. Oh, and he's also, canonically, “friend to all children.” It's that latter point that serves as the basis for Gamera Rebirth, the first new project for the turtle titan in 17 years. Set in 1989 Tokyo, this CG anime series follows youngsters Boco, Joe, and Junichi—and their bully Brody, an American whose parents work on a military base—as the world is besieged by hordes of monsters, with the barely-understood force of nature that is Gamera the only thing that can stop them. Rebirth's format is unusual—45 minutes per episode, a rarity in anime—but allows each episode to spotlight one of the signature enemy kaiju from the classic films in greater depth, and pack in enough city-smashing action that you'll be left asking ""Godzilla who?""

La Révolution

In a triumph of on-the-nose conceptualizing, La Révolution spins an alt-history romp in on-the-cusp-of-revolt France, where the cruel aristocracy become literal “blue-bloods” thanks to a contagion that turns them into inky-veined, dandyish fiends ravenous for human flesh. A plucky reformist contessa who sympathizes with the commoners' plight—first of being exploited by the ruling class, and then being eaten by them—allies with forces both rebel and supernatural as she tries to prevent the undead disease spreading from the elite of Versaille to the whole of France's upper crust. Surprisingly great production values and a cast that's clearly enjoying themselves elevates this above your standard zombie nonsense—and it's subtitled, which definitely means it's arthouse, right?

Pending Train

Netflix: *License one of Japan's best SF dramas in years*. Also Netflix: *Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer*. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn't sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers' first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begin to realize there may be a reason they've been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, think of Pending Train as a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.

One Piece

Mark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.

Ragnarok

If you're a fan of Norse mythology but Marvel's Thor got too goofy for you with Love and Thunder, this Norwegian fantasy drama may be more to your liking. Set in the present day, young Magne Seier (David Stakston) finds he is the reincarnation of the god of thunder, just in time to make a stand against the sinister Jutul family whose polluting factories blight his hometown of Edda. No, the show is not subtle with its references, nor its environmentalism, but it's a fun reimagining of myth, especially as more members of the Norse pantheon start cropping up. Best of all, with only three six-episode seasons and an actual ending—no surprise cancelations here!—it's a nicely digestible binge watch.

The Chosen One

Based on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)

Travelers

Travelers is something of a hidden gem, albeit one that's increasingly less hidden as people realize the genius of this tight, entertaining Canadian sci-fi series. Run by Brad Wright, one of the cocreators of Stargate SG-1, the show follows a team of time travelers sent back to “the 21st” to prevent the postapocalyptic future from which they came. The twist is how they travel. The travelers have their consciousness transferred into the bodies of people shortly before their death, adopting their identities and living their lives between missions. It's an often thrilling, sometimes complicated watch that perfectly treads the line between serious sci-fi and accessible entertainment.

Heartstopper

Arguably the most joyful show on Netflix is back for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt romance. With Charlie (Joe Locke) and Nick (Kit Connor) now officially dating, this long-awaited second season starts off with Nick struggling to come out as bisexual—but it’s openly gay Charlie’s parents who seem to struggle the most with their relationship. Meanwhile, Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao’s (William Gao) will-they-won’t-they saga continues to sizzle, and a school trip to Paris turns into a crucible for everyone’s emotions. Although it steps into slightly darker terrain this season, the brilliant adaptation of Alice Oseman’s graphic novels continues to be an utter delight—the show that younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, that older ones needed years ago, and that everyone needs to watch whatever your sexuality.

Cobra Kai

While this latter-day sequel to The Karate Kid films of the 1980s started life on YouTube Red (remember that?), it’s really come into its own since moving to Netflix. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first movie, the debut season of Cobra Kai finds the tables turned, with Daniel living the charmed life while Johnny is washed up. Yet after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña) in a fight, Johnny finds new meaning by reopening the eponymous karate dojo and guiding a new generation of students. As the series progresses, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California and alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity. It’s all presented a little bit tongue in cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks. But thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, and with a younger cast you can’t help but root for, it’s a retro-styled delight. With a sixth and final season in the works, now is the perfect time to binge the first five.

Cunk on Earth

British comedy alert: This might not be for you. If, however, you appreciate drier-than-a-desert humor and cringe-inducingly awkward interviews, this is a must-watch. A perfectly framed lampoon of globe-trotting documentaries, Cunk on Earth follows host Philomena Cunk (played by comedian Diane Morgan) as she explores world history, from the development of agriculture to the space race, offering deranged insights and skewering real-world experts with incredibly stupid questions along the way. Morgan’s relentlessly deadpan delivery is reason enough to watch this five-episode series, but it’s those interviews that make this comedy gold.

Glitch

To those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best-kept secrets of the past decade. Centered on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine “the Risen,” Hayes’ world is rocked when he learns his own late wife, Kate, is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead’s return is teased out, starting with simply “how” and “why” but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.

The Witcher

Henry Cavill's final season as monster hunter Geralt of Rivia is here, continuing the hit Netflix adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski's novels. The newest season finds Geralt, ally Yennefer (Anya Chalotra), and trainee witcher Ciri (Freya Allan) on the run, evading those who would use Ciri's ferocious potential for their own sinister purposes. Everything gets ramped up in season 3, with improved fight choreography—Allan is particularly impressive—complex political machinations, and more for supporting characters such as bard Jaskier (Joey Batey) to do beyond compose catchy earworms. It's still a bit (unintentionally?) campy at times, but for a high-fantasy binge watch, it's one of the best shows around.

Shadow and Bone

Based on the novels of Leigh Bardugo, Shadow and Bone follows orphan Alina Starkov (Jessie Mei Li) as she learns she is the long-fabled Sun Summoner—the one person who may be able to disperse “the Fold,” a wall of shadow that has bisected the country of Ravka for decades. As Alina struggles to master her newfound abilities, she becomes the centerpiece in a deadly game as rival forces seek to control or kill her before she can change the world. With two eight-episode seasons to its name so far, Shadows and Bone builds a rich universe filled with compelling characters and interesting twists on fantasy staples, one perfect for fans of YA fiction or those who prefer the layered complexity of Game of Thrones.

Black Mirror

As creator Charlie Brooker recently told WIRED, “Black Mirror wasn’t meant to be ‘this is what’s going on in technology this week.’ It was always designed to be a more paranoid and weird and hopefully unique show.” And that it is, but rather than displaying what’s going on in technology as it’s happening, the show has a way of beating its viewers to the paranoid punch, addressing dystopian anxieties before they even happen. (Black Mirror was talking about AI long before your mom ever heard of ChatGPT.) Netflix just released the sixth season of Brooker’s show, and if you haven’t watched, now may be the time. How else will you know what you’ll be worried about five years from now?

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

On the planet Etheria, Adora loyally serves the Horde, rising through its ranks with her close friend Catra by her side until the discovery of a strange sword transforms Adora into the legendary warrior She-Ra. Learning the truth about the oppressive forces she’s served her whole life, Adora joins the Rebellion against the Horde—but can she really turn her back on everything she’s ever known? And will Catra be able to forgive the betrayal? Developed by ND Stevenson—whose own Nimona delighted viewers as an animated movie on Netflix—the modern She-Ra reimagines the 1980s classic, eschewing the original’s connection to He-Man and its episodic structure in favor of unique mythology and long-form storytelling that’s packed with complex characters, high stakes, and some powerfully emotional moments. Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, this dazzlingly animated five-season action-fantasy is as compelling for older fans as it is younger viewers—and the fact that it offers some of the best LGBTQ+ representation to be found in any medium doesn’t hurt either.

Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story

A prequel to Bridgerton—Shondaland’s Regency-era historical romance, which continues to break Netflix viewership records—Queen Charlotte takes viewers back to 1761, exploring how a young Charlotte (India Amarteifio) meets and marries George III (Corey Mylchreest). In typical Bridgerton fashion, it’s far more than a period love story, with the spirited Charlotte initially trying to escape the arranged marriage before learning to navigate the corridors of power—and manage George’s deteriorating mental health. Interspersed with scenes in Bridgerton’s “present-day” 1817, where the now-formidable stateswoman Queen Charlotte (a returning Golda Rosheuvel) deals with a succession crisis to the throne, this limited series is compulsory viewing for fans of the series, and a great entry point for anyone yet to be wooed by its charms.

Black Knight

By the waning years of the 21st century, a comet strike has all but wiped out humanity, while pollution has gotten so bad that even breathable air is a rarity. In what remains of Korea, the all-powerful Cheonmyeong Group controls everything, forcing the poor to serve as couriers delivering resources to the privileged rich, isolated away from the desert wasteland the surface has become. Yet one courier, the legendary and enigmatic “5-8” (Kim Woo-bin), is on course to deliver a revolution. With dashes of Mad Max, The 100, and even Hideo Kojima's bizarre sci-fi courier game Death Stranding, Black Knight will be familiar to fans of the postapocalyptic genre. But its thrilling chases, brutal fight scenes, and darkly beautiful scenery make it compelling viewing, while its class and governance themes provide some depth beyond the spectacle.

Inside Man

Jefferson Grieff (Stanley Tucci), a former criminology professor who is on death row for killing his wife, is telling his story to a journalist named Beth (Lydia West). Harry Watling (David Tennant) is an unassuming English vicar who is tending to his parishioners. The two men are a world apart—until a horrific misunderstanding leads to Watling trapping a friend of Beth’s in his basement. As Watling’s situation and mental state deteriorate, Beth turns to the killer for help finding her friend. Created and written by Stephen Moffat, this tense transatlantic thriller has just a dash of The Silence of the Lambs, and with a cast at the top of their game, it’s gripping viewing. Best of all, its tight four episodes mean you can binge it in one go.

Queer Eye

They’re back! After what feels like far, far too long, the Fab Five return for another dose of more-than-a-makeover magic. Season 7 sees Karamo, Jonathan, Bobby, Tam, and Antoni bringing their unique skills to New Orleans, where they help a frat house clean up their toxic masculinity, revive stagnant relationships, and teach a teacher to love herself as much as her students—and that’s just a taste. Prepare to ugly-cry all over again.

The Diplomat

If there's a West Wing–shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated beyond the norms of the genre by a superb central performance from The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis before it escalates into full-blown war. It's a job that might go easier if her own special relationship with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) weren't fraying, as his resentment at being demoted leads him to interfere in her efforts. One of Netflix's biggest hits of 2023, The Diplomat has already been renewed for a second season.

Sweet Tooth

Based on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth is set 10 years after “The Sick,” a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led—somehow—to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The first season follows Gus, a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and “Big Man” Tommy Jeppard, a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. The newly dropped second season takes things into darker territory, merging Gus and Jeppard’s path with the once-disparate storyline of Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), a scientist researching the origins of The Sick—and its connections to Gus. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a postapocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.

You

Based on the novels of Caroline Kepnes, You is an often deeply disturbing tale of obsession. The first season follows Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley), a bookstore manager in New York who falls in deranged love at first sight with aspiring author Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), while the second sees him relocate to Los Angeles, where heiress Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) becomes the focus of his attention. However, as their twisted relationship evolves, Love proves to have dark desires of her own. Often shocking, You is a gripping thriller that hits the same sinister sweet spot as early (read: good) seasons of Dexter.

Lost in Space

It’s a few years old at this point, but Netflix’s update of the classic 1960s sci-fi show is one of the rarest entries on the service now—a genre show that the streamer can’t cancel after one season, because it’s already completed its three-season run. That means you can settle in to this glossier take on the Robinson family and their desperate attempt to survive on an alien planet without fear of a permanent cliffhanger or a never-coming conclusion. The stakes are far higher in this reboot, though, with the Robinsons trapped on a dangerous alien world after an attempt to evacuate a doomed Earth goes disastrously wrong. Stranded, with no way to reunite with the colony mission they were once part of, the family’s fate may rest with a strange robot befriended by youngest son Will—but unlike in the original show, this robot caused the disaster that stranded them. With less saccharine family dynamics than the original, less camp (with the arguable exception of Parker Posey, stealing scenes as the nefarious Dr. Smith), and a more ambitious long-form story stretching across its three seasons, Lost in Space is a strong update for modern viewers.

Alice in Borderland

When slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted.",technology

I'm Moist Critikal,

and this is the Wired Autocomplete Interview.

[upbeat music]

Penguinz0, Moist Critikal Charlie, Big Moist, Huge Charles.

[upbeat music]

What is Moist Critikal?

A five foot six hulking testosterone titan

who makes a bunch of wacky, silly garbage on the internet.

What does Moist Critikal do for a living?

I just post really ridiculous things on the internet

and got lucky enough that it enables me to survive.

What did Moist Critikal do before YouTube?

Nothing, I was 10 before YouTube.

I didn't have a career or a job,

I was still just snorting glue and drinking milk,

I was just a baby boy.

So I used to mow lawns for money,

which probably isn't allowed

with the child labor laws in America.

What is Moist Critikal email?

Just critikalcontact@gmail.

You're gonna have a hard time reaching me there.

I did meet one of my best friends through email,

his name's Kaya.

He reached out a long time ago with a super sad message

that really tickled my heartstrings.

I replied back, we became good friends through it,

but these days, most people just sign me up

for cult newsletters and a lot of other like really awful

WebMD, like hypochondriac bait,

but you're welcome to send me something,

I probably won't see it though.

I'll just give it one of these.

[board thuds]

Why is Moist Critikal Penguinz0?

The [indistinct] is super simple.

I was actually a child.

I made the account in 2007, I was 11.

I thought penguins were cool.

The name Penguin was taken, not that deep.

Why does Moist Critikal wear white shirts?

Convenience, most of everything I have

in my life comes from Walmart, so I just get big packs

of white shirts and that's good enough for me.

I'm not out here trying to make any kind

of fashion statements, so it's super simple, super easy.

Why does Moist Critikal talk like that?

That's a question for God, not me.

I couldn't tell you,

it's just I have very weird vocal chords,

I have a very monotone voice.

The best description I've heard of it

is that it sounds like an unenthusiastic hand job.

I've been really gravitating towards the word goofy

over the last year or so that like these words

that kind of fell out of grace for a while,

old expressions, like calling someone an old battleax

or a harpy or a harlot, goofy, silly, wacky.

It's like fetal development where you're

in like the zygotic stage all the way 'til birth.

Right now I'm in like the goofy development.

Why does Moist Critikal look like Jesus?

I just don't think I do, I really don't.

I just have long hair and I'm short.

I don't know if Jesus was short, but other than that,

I think that's where the similarity stopped.

He had like really brown hair, mine's more black.

I don't think I look like him at all,

but most people seem to think I do.

[board thuds] Is Moist Critikal in a band?

Yeah, it's a two-man band.

It's me and my buddy Troy, he's from New Zealand,

we are the Gentle Men.

Troy does all of the music, I do all the lyrics and vocals

that's why a lot of them are very silly.

Like 2019 Guy is all about being a cuck

and being super happy about it

and Skynut's all about robots that are powered

by human semen from the future.

He does all the really good music stuff

and I do all the super stupid stuff, we make a great team.

Is Moist Critikal from Florida?

I was born in Tampa, moved to Orlando,

moved back to Tampa in sixth grade

and I've been here ever since.

I'm not leaving until Florida's fully underwater

and even then I might still stick around.

I don't think I have very many Florida man qualities

other than maybe the way I dress or where I go, I guess.

We went to a club called The Castle last week,

which is a goth nightclub with a station for paddling

and all kinds of like bunk beds,

but I don't think I have many Florida man qualities myself,

not that I can think of at least.

Is Moist Critikal jacked?

Not to toot my own horn, but I do lift very often.

I was a human science major with a concentration

in exercise physiologies, but I'm not really jacked.

I keep myself lean 'cause I'm five foot six

so if I get jacked I look like a meatball

and it looks really gross.

Is Moist Critikal scared of cockroaches?

Nope, common misconception.

I scream because I'm trying to scare them away.

So I'm not afraid of anything except flying.

Is Moist Critikal scared of flying?

What do you know?

Yeah, I am scared of flying, it's my main phobia.

Really, the only phobia.

[board thuds]

Does Critikal have a world record?

Not anymore, every time I get a world record,

I post about it and some goblin out there goes

and takes it from me.

Most of my previous records were speed run related,

so gaming.

Mr. Krabs overdoses on ketamine and dies, it got taken.

I held a record in House of Caravan, got taken.

I did have a record for a little while, kind of,

not an official one for sex toy collecting,

but then Belle Delphine beat me.

So right now, no world records and probably never will hold

one for long, but I have had previous records.

When did Critikal reveal his face?

2015, I think.

I started posting on Snapchat,

doing like recorded covers of popular music

and then I eventually posted that Snapchat in a comment

on a video called Paint the Town Red,

but I don't think I started putting it in videos

until 2016 or 2017.

Does Critikal have Discord?

I don't go on it super often, only to talk to like friends

or do voice calls with friends, but I do have it.

[board thuds]

That was outrageous, sorry about that.

What is Penguinz0's favorite anime?

Code Geass, it is I think a masterpiece.

It has one of my favorite endings in all of fiction

and I think the whole thing is just beautifully written.

What does Penguinz0 drive?

An SUV, I got an SUV little over a year ago.

I just like the SUV more because I'm very risk averse,

so it's a safer vehicle.

What is Penguinz0 favorite game?

City of Heroes, it's an old MMO that I think

is truly underrated.

Shut down in 2012, God rest its soul,

but I think it's still an incredible game.

There's private servers, I still play from time to time.

I guess second to City of Heroes would be Halo II.

[board thuds]

Does Charles Christopher White Jr have a brother?

Not that I know of.

I am pretty sure I'm the only child,

but I've never really sat my parents down

to get to the bottom of it.

I'm pretty sure it's just me.

Does Charles Christopher White Jr act in Hunger Games?

Don't ask silly questions, you know the answer.

Yes, I'm the only thing that held

that entire franchise together and it's an absolute shame

that they didn't call me back for the most recent one.

I'm very disappointed with their decision,

but I will never forget the time I spent on that set.

Is Charles Christopher White Jr still alive?

Yeah. [board thuds]

Can Moist Critikal play guitar?

I tried, I played in middle school,

I dropped it in high school,

I haven't really touched it since.

I can do Tears Don't Fall intro still, I think,

but other than that, nothing else.

How did Moist Critikal get famous?

I didn't, you've been misled.

I just post shit on the internet

and some people watch it and that's really about it,

but I guess maybe the Hunger Games would be

another answer to that.

When does Moist Critikal stream?

Pretty much every night, times vary, all very spontaneous.

Sometimes I don't stream every day, you never really know,

you got to stay on your toes.

Does Moist Critikal use a script?

Nope, fire on the camera, talk about absolute nonsense,

and that's about the extent of the effort

that goes into that.

Unless we're doing something like wrestling.

With wrestling, we plan out a lot

of what goes on beforehand,

but when it's just a normal video, it's super simple.

I just start talking about some really goofy shit

and that's about it. [board thuds]

Thanks for having me on.

A big fuck you to the Hunger Games

for not bringing me back.

District 8 hospital helper is the only glue

that held that disheveled franchise together.

Aside from that, it was just a lot of fun,

thank you for putting it together.",technology
"The Senate moved first and is expected to vote on the bill early next week after clearing an initial procedural hurdle Thursday. The House will follow and is likely to consider the measure under suspension of the rules — an expedited process that requires a two-thirds majority. The tactic could ease Johnson’s push to pass the deal by bypassing tricky procedural votes that hardliners have tanked recently.

This new version of the bill is on track to pass both houses with bipartisan support. Yet the abortion policy omission is a blow to conservatives who muscled the provision into the House version of the bill over the summer.

Hard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a member of the conference committee on the defense bill, described her position as “hell no” after GOP provisions on abortion and transgender troops fell away and an extension of the surveillance authorities was included.

“This was a total sell-out of conservative principles and a huge win for Democrats,” Greene tweeted.

Still, Republicans saw wins with some concessions that rein in Pentagon efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the ranks.

Lawmakers in both parties expect Johnson to help shepherd a bipartisan bill through the House. But pushing through a bill that drops many conservative priorities could earn Johnson even greater ire. He’s already taking heat from his right flank on government funding, Ukraine aid and other issues.

The Pentagon instituted a policy this year to reimburse troops for the costs of traveling to seek abortions. Republicans argue it undermines laws that bar taxpayer money for abortions.

The Democratic-led Senate sidestepped the abortion issue altogether in the debate on its version of the defense bill. Blocking the Pentagon’s abortion travel policy was a red line for Democrats that would have tanked the bill.

House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) predicted the lack of abortion language won’t be a major impediment to the bill’s chances because most Republicans saw it as a long shot.

“I told everybody when that stuff was added on the floor, it was never going to survive the Senate,” Rogers said. “And anybody who thought it was [is] not being realistic.”

The final deal also drops controversial House GOP-backed language blocking coverage of transition surgeries and hormone treatments for transgender troops.

But attaching a short-term extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act until April 19 may be Johnson’s biggest stumbling block within his own ranks.

Conservatives, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), had privately urged him to keep the two issues separate, as did Rogers.

Congress has until the end of the year to reauthorize the surveillance authority, which is meant to target foreigners abroad but also has the ability to sweep in Americans. But with no agreed-upon path forward, lawmakers need more time.

Johnson defended linking the NDAA and the surveillance extension in a letter Thursday to fellow Republicans, saying he received a commitment from Senate leaders that they would negotiate a final surveillance bill. In a joint statement Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell committed to “work in good faith” on a bipartisan bill that can pass both chambers.

Republican leaders plan to do a whip count electronically on Friday, which will give them an idea of how many members may defect on the defense bill.

Rogers said he’s urging lawmakers to base their votes on the totality of the 3,000-plus page bill, not just a four-month surveillance extension.

“To say, ‘Well, I can’t vote for it with FISA.’ No, you’re going to be on record voting against everything that’s in the largest bill that passes each year,” Rogers said. “There’s many, many, many items in there that you probably don’t want to be on the record as opposing.”

Still, conservatives won some concessions in the final Pentagon policy bill that Republican leaders hope will sell the package to their ranks.

The bill kept House language banning the endorsement of critical race theory in the military.

The deal also requires the Pentagon comptroller to review the workforce dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policy. It also includes a salary cap and hiring freeze for the diversity workforce.

The bill text also includes a requirement that the Pentagon develop a plan on what to do with unused border wall materials. The language follows a push from Senate Armed Services ranking member Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) to halt the Biden administration’s auctioning of those materials.

"Square Enix already let us know that it was working on DLC for Final Fantasy XVI. But during the Game Awards, we learned it was working on not one but two DLC chapters with one of them available... right now. Watch the trailer here.

The first DLC, Echoes of the Fallen, is a new story chapter that takes place before the final battle. It features the whole gang working together (honesty, I choked up to see it) to investigate — what else — more messed up crystals. In the DLC, Clive will also be able to wield the iconic buster sword weapon from Final Fantasy VII as well as earn a chiptune version of the FFXVI song “Away”. It’s available right now, but I haven’t been able to find a link in the PlayStation store yet.",technology

"Twenty-four of the so-called fake Trump electors now face criminal charges in three different states, and one of the legal architects of the plan to deploy them, Kenneth Chesebro, has emerged as a witness in all of the cases.

Mr. Chesebro, a Harvard-trained lawyer, helped develop the plan to have Republicans in battleground states won by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020 present themselves as Trump electors. The scheme was part of an effort to have Congress block or delay certification of Mr. Biden’s Electoral College victory on Jan. 6, 2021.

Earlier this week, a Nevada grand jury indicted six former Trump electors, including top leaders of the state’s Republican Party, on charges of forging and submitting fraudulent documents.

In August, a grand jury in Atlanta returned an indictment against former president Donald J. Trump and 18 allies, including three who were fake electors in Georgia. And in July, Attorney General Dana Nessel of Michigan brought charges against all 16 Republicans who acted as Trump electors in her state. (In October, she dropped charges against one of them, James Renner, in exchange for his cooperation.)",political
"The European Union today agreed on the details of the AI Act, a far-reaching set of rules for the people building and using artificial intelligence. It’s a milestone law that, lawmakers hope, will create a blueprint for the rest of the world.

After months of debate about how to regulate companies like OpenAI, lawmakers from the EU’s three branches of government—the Parliament, Council, and Commission—spent more than 36 hours in total thrashing out the new legislation between Wednesday afternoon and Friday evening. Lawmakers were under pressure to strike a deal before the EU parliament election campaign starts in the new year.

“The EU AI Act is a global first,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on X. “[It is] a unique legal framework for the development of AI you can trust. And for the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses.”

The law itself is not a world-first; China’s new rules for generative AI went into effect in August. But the EU AI Act is the most sweeping rulebook of its kind for the technology. It includes bans on biometric systems that identify people using sensitive characteristics such as sexual orientation and race, and the indiscriminate scraping of faces from the internet. Lawmakers also agreed that law enforcement should be able to use biometric identification systems in public spaces for certain crimes.

New transparency requirements for all general purpose AI models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT, and stronger rules for “very powerful” models were also included. “The AI Act sets rules for large, powerful AI models, ensuring they do not present systemic risks to the Union,” says Dragos Tudorache, member of the European Parliament and one of two co-rapporteurs leading the negotiations.

Companies that don’t comply with the rules can be fined up to 7 percent of their global turnover. The bans on prohibited AI will take effect in six months, the transparency requirements in 12 months, and the full set of rules in around two years.

Measures designed to make it easier to protect copyright holders from generative AI and require general purpose AI systems to be more transparent about their energy use were also included.

“Europe has positioned itself as a pioneer, understanding the importance of its role as a global standard setter,” said European Commissioner Thierry Breton in a press conference on Friday night.",technology
"Gamers have long been stigmatized as lonely weirdos. Some of that has been deserved—ask anyone who’s had a bunch of children shout horrible slurs at them during a match of Call Of Duty. But some leaders in the gaming industry want to push back against that narrative by creating games that encourage users to form communities as part of the gameplay. The idea is that by fostering more human interactions, games can promote positivity and openness, bringing people together instead of pushing them apart.

“Whether it’s a town hall meeting for a community or whether it’s a group of gamers getting together in a park, whenever people meet face-to-face, there’s a level of civility, courtesy, and respect that you often see,” says John Hanke, the founder and CEO of Niantic, the developer behind the massively popular augmented-reality mobile game Pokémon Go. He says a big part of cultivating that sort of positive interaction involves designing a game that entices players outside their comfort zones—or, in the case of an AR game like Pokémon Go, actually getting them outside. “It’s just sort of wired into us to be more open to real human contact and not be as quick to withdraw and as heated and nasty as online.”

Hanke’s remarks were part of a panel at LiveWIRED, an event held yesterday in San Francisco for WIRED’s 30th anniversary. The session, called “Will Games Eat the World?”, featured Hanke; Rachel Kowert, the research director at Take This, a nonprofit that cultivates mental health resources for gamers and game developers; and Jade Raymond, the president and founder of Haven Studios, a game developer that was acquired by Sony last year. The panel was moderated by WIRED special projects editor, Alan Henry.",technology
"NotebookLM, Google’s experimental AI-powered note-taking app, is now widely available in the US. It’s also getting several new features and is “starting” to use Google’s Gemini Pro AI model “to help with document understanding and reasoning,” according to the company.

Hi. Hello. Good afternoon, welcome to Sci-fi IRL.

Or as I've been calling it all week, Sci-fi-RL.

That, for those of you,

the one or two who are baffled by those abbreviations,

that means science fiction in real life.

As the voice of God said,

I am Jason Kehe, I'm a Features Editor at Wired.

And most of the science fiction we've published,

I'd say in the last 10 years, I've probably edited,

including by at least two of our three panelists today.

And you can read about their many books and distinctions

in the program.

We don't have a ton of time,

so I just wanna bring them up here as fast as possible.

So please help me welcome Charlie Jane, Annalee,

and Yudha to the stage.

[upbeat music]

Oh, fantastic. So let's get started right away.

It sort of strikes me that when

technologists imagine the future,

when they predict the future, we call it futurism.

When writers do it, we call it science fiction.

But maybe I had that wrong, or maybe I'm oversimplifying.

So Annalee, let's start with you.

Do you consider yourself a futurist?

I think that I do futurism more in my non-fiction

than my fiction.

I do think it's useful to have a distinction

between futurism, which is often hopefully evidence-based,

unless it's about paperclips,

in which case it's sort of based on faith.

And then science fiction,

I think we're able to bring in our imaginations more.

We can kind of bring in a tooth fairy or two

to make things happen.

Whereas in good futurism, I think,

you always wanna be keeping it as real as possible.

Charlie Jane, same question. What do you make of futurism?

Do you consider yourself doing it?

I mean, I sort of think of it as like a side hustle,

to be honest.

I don't know.

I mean, I love what Annalee said about faith-based futurism.

I think we're dealing with,

we're actually struggling under the weight

of a lot of faith-based futurism right now.

And the job of speculative fiction authors

is basically to be apostates and to say,

Yeah, your beautiful candy-colored,

candy-covered future that you've imagined

probably isn't gonna come to pass,

and you haven't thought through any of the possible

second order impacts of all the shiny technologies

you think we're gonna have miraculously in the future.

And so I think skepticism is what

a good speculative fiction author can bring

to the kind of pie in the sky futurism we often see.

And I should add for the audience, real quick,

that all three of our panelists write both fiction

and nonfiction.

I wanna ask Annalee about her upcoming book

a little later, but Yudha, where are you beaming in from?

I'm in Singapore right now.

So I'm from Sri Lanka, but right now I'm in Singapore.

It's about four in the morning.

And I'm in a hotel room that's, let's just say,

it's basically booked by the hour.

[audience laughing]

It's the cleanest place that I could find

at four in the morning.

[Jason] Well, we really appreciate you being here

at such an insane time.

Futurism. Do you consider yourself doing it, ever?

As a writer, as a thinker?

I've been accused of it, yes.

I think of it as rolling the dice

and seeing where they fall.

I'm very wary of painting myself as a futurist

because a lot of things that I see in futurism.

I'm from Sri Lanka,

a country which is mostly known these days

for economic collapse and before that, for war.

So some of the things I read in, I stop in novels, I go,

Well, that's not too bad, that's just Tuesday.

So I'm sometimes hesitant to put myself into that camp.

So I think of it as rolling the dice.

Some of my all-time favorite writers,

I'm guessing they're also some of your favorite writers,

have made versions of the remark

that science fiction as a genre is not predictive,

it's descriptive.

That's Le Guin. Gibson says the work is not prescient.

Ray Bradbury said, I'm not a predictor of futures.

I'm a preventor of futures.

So when I run down some of those lines,

what does that make you think?

Do you agree with those?

Do you consider yourself part of that lineage?

Or are you doing something different, Charlie Jane?

I mean, is it predicting to the future

to say if you lick a light socket,

you're not gonna have a nice time?

Like is that prediction or is that just like,

Hey, don't lick light sockets, people!

'Cause I feel like a lot of what people consider

to be prediction,

especially when it comes to like dystopian

or apocalyptic science fiction,

is literally just don't lick light sockets.

I love that.

The don't lick light sockets PSA version of science fiction.

I mean, I think in some ways that's true,

that dystopian science fiction,

which now is quite mainstream

and is often just considered drama, really is a PSA.

Like, yeah, if you keep releasing carbon emissions,

the planet's gonna warm up.

We're gonna have more storms.

I think that science fiction,

when it's not being kind of near future dystopian,

does have a chance to be not predictive,

but just opening up a bigger map

that allows us to see what we're doing in a larger social

or cultural context, a larger temporal context,

and just make us think about that,

and kinda consider the implications,

the second and third-order effects

that we were talking about before.

Yudha, anything to add?

Nope. Agree completely.

It's a bit like The Garden of Forking Paths, right?

You take an idea and you test it and you sort of logic,

you try to extrapolate where this can go.

And science fiction is a really good canvas for that.

Doesn't necessarily mean that it might come true

in exactly that fashion, but along the way,

you might learn really useful lessons.

Like, let's not lick the light sockets.

I do wanna try to unpack this a little bit more

because the fact is so much of the time,

the futures in science fiction do come to pass in some form.

I mean, most people in the tech world,

from Elon Musk and Peter Thiel,

all the way down to some coder hacking away

in her parents' basement, read science fiction.

Not only do they read it,

they kind of maybe not even so secretly

want to make it real.

I mean, flying cars, teleportation, AI,

these were all in science fiction for many, many decades.

And now they're all starting to come up.

So is there, I guess the question is,

is there an obligation on the part

of a science fiction writer

to responsibly predict the future,

knowing that it might inspire a generation

of real world technologists

who then want to go on and build it?

I mean, one of my favorite examples of this is,

the classic dystopian novel 1984,

which predicts telescreens.

And then clearly Silicon Valley was like,

Great, let's have Zoom. Let's have social media.

Like telescreen sounds so awesome, badass.

You never turn it off and it can always see you?

That sounds great!

Think of all the marketing that we can build around this.

So I think George Orwell was not sitting there,

hoping that his invention would become something

that VCs were funding in the future.

And I don't know how he could have been more responsible.

He was basically like, This will turn your world to shit.

And yet it still became a marketing,

it still became part of a business plan.

So I think that our responsibility

is really to engage with our audiences

and to make sure that we don't just put a story

into the world without also kind of engaging

with factual issues

and kind of talking about the real-world issues

that go along with the fiction.

Yeah, actually, it's a shameless plug.

Annalee and I did a series on our podcast recently

called Silicon Valley versus Science Fiction.

And our podcast is called, Our Opinions are Correct.

And we kind of delved into some of the ways

that Silicon Valley kind of either deliberately,

or kind of inadvertently misinterprets speculative fiction.

And often when they say that they're inspired

by science fiction, that's just marketing.

It's a marketing thing.

They just are like,

This is a thing that people have seen in popular media

that we can say we were inspired by.

Or they're kind of just taking what Annalee said,

the kind of dystopian stuff from a dark future

and then making it look shiny for consumers.

But I think that the idea of responsibly predicting

the future feels like a trap to me.

Like it feels like you can't possibly,

whenever you write a story,

you can't possibly know how people are going to receive it

or what they're gonna get from it.

And you just have to tell the best story you can.

Is there, I think I remember an op-ed you wrote,

Charlie Jane, several years ago,

in maybe the Washington Post, about climate fiction?

Is this ringing a bell?

Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah.

You, I think, called on all science fiction writers

to incorporate some climate element into their storytelling.

I think you may have even said

there was a moral obligation to do so.

So I wonder how you think about that now?

'Cause that was a few years ago.

And if it plays a part in what I'm sort

of asking about the responsibility of writers

to imagine futures a certain way?

Yeah, I mean, thank you for asking that.

'Cause that is something that's really close to my heart.

I think the crux of my argument

isn't just that you have a moral obligation

to warn about climate change, which I think is true.

But it's really that if you ignore this huge thing

that's on the horizon, and now more than, like,

whenever I wrote that op-ed, right?

I think it was almost like four or five years ago.

Now, it's even more like looming on the horizon.

If you're like,

Yeah, my novel takes place 20 years from now,

and there's no climate change.

That's not realism.

Like realism is acknowledging that 20 years from now,

we are going to be really, really up to our necks in it.

And there's no way to imagine a future

or depict a future of the 2040s

that where climate change isn't a huge big deal

at this point.

So it's just like,

Are you gonna write about what's actually gonna happen?

Or are you gonna just be like,

'Oh, the magical fairies came down.'

And you can write a fantasy novel where fairies came down

and just sucked up all the carbon.

They were carbon-eating fairies,

who just came in, nom, nom, nom.

These fairies have been starving for some CO2,

for thousands of years in fairy land.

And then they found a rich source of it.

But other than that, no, you have to deal with it.

Yudha, any thoughts on moral obligations?

The responsibilities of writers?

Well, I used to be of the camp

that we have a moral obligation to address certain things.

As of late, my view has changed.

And it's changed on a very personal scale,

which is Sri Lanka, like last year,

went through an economic crisis, mass protests,

the whole nine yards.

And most of my work also involves being a journalist.

We mapped 600-odd protests as they happened.

We used satellite imagery to locate a mass grave.

And the strain of this work, I would say,

forced me to think about writing in a different way,

which is to take the brakes off and say,

Okay, there's no moral obligation to do anything.

There are things that are on the horizon, yes,

but it's up to the individual

whether they want to talk about it or not.

So I can only answer for myself in this,

which is I've started to approach my fiction

from a perspective of, What ideas am I interested in?

Because from where I sit,

the world is broken in so many ways.

And if I were to write about that,

I would write forever about things that depress me

and I would end up killing myself.

So I've tried to strike a balance in my own practice,

if you will, and sometimes I fail.

2021, I wrote a novel about Sri Lanka failing,

the economy being collapsed artificially,

and mass protests and President being thrown out.

2022, that happened. And people gave me an award for it.

I absolutely hate that it happened.

I was in that crowd as it happened,

and that was not a prediction I ever wanted to come true.

So I would start to think of it from the perspective

of what concerns us,

what issues do we really want to talk about?

What do we have funded?

I'm staying away from the moral responsibility

of science fiction, or this question altogether.

I know it's a cop-out answer, but...

No, I like it.

I do wanna talk now about optimism then,

since you sort of alluded to it.

And I think optimism, maybe as a philosophy,

sometimes gets a bad rap,

or dismissed as intellectually unserious.

Or I don't know.

I'm curious how each of you thinks about optimism as writers

of science fiction when you are imagining futures

that could be shitty or could be hopeful.

Well, I've just spent the past couple of years

working on a nonfiction book

that's coming out next year that's a history of PSYOPs

and culture war in the United States,

which was very depressing.

There isn't a lot of hope in that field.

But one of the ways that I dealt with it,

because a lot of it was very heavy,

like a lot of learning about

how people have been emotionally tormented for 200 years.

I, at the same time wrote a novel called The Terraformers,

which is out.

And it's actually about a revolution on another planet,

which is relatively successful as revolutions go.

And I was imagining the book in some ways,

the fiction book as a counter PSYOP.

And I think it was because I was so immersed

in this language of PSYOPs

that I started thinking of how a story itself

can actually embed itself into people's minds

and provide a way out of some of this dystopian thinking

that we're stuck in.

And there's a reason we're stuck in dystopian thinking.

Like, things are going badly. I'm sure you've noticed.

And I think that being able to have stories

that map out a way beyond warfare,

a way that goes beyond constant resource extraction

is really important.

And so, I don't know if I would say that I'm optimistic,

but I am definitely in favor of attempting

to put down our weapons to use stories

as a form of peacemaking.

Charlie Jane, I mean, do you see? Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, I think everything I write is hopeful.

I don't write anything that's like despairing

or overly depressing or doom-saying.

I feel like everything I write is hopeful

about our ability to surmount challenges.

And I think that's what part of what science fiction

is really good for.

Science fiction is the literature of problem-solving.

And it's great for imagining ways

that we can get past some of the challenges

that we are undoubtedly gonna be facing.

And by the way,

when I say you have to deal with climate change

in your work,

I don't mean that you have to write about climate change

or that it has to be what the story is about.

It can be in the background.

It can be like there's all this other stuff going on,

that's your story.

But then we have to at least be aware

that climate change is a thing in the world,

is sort of where I'm at.

But yeah, I think hope.

Annalee mentioned Terraformers.

I'd love, Charlie Jane,

if you can mention a book that maybe speaks

to some of these themes, tell us about it.

Tell us, talk about the hope involved in it,

and how you kind of conceptualized it.

A book that just seems relevant to this conversation.

Wait, so, Of your own.

Oh, you mean All the Birds -

Just plug one of your books, basically.

Oh, okay. I mean -

Tell us about your work. Charlie Jane.

I mean, I feel like all my books,

like All the Birds in the Sky

is probably the one you're thinking of.

That's the one that's like about technology and nature

and the ability to kind of see them

as parts of a whole, rather than in opposition.

And to show that like we can actually,

they can work in harmony, and we can,

through human connection,

through learning to understand each other,

we can actually build a world

where technology and nature are harmonious,

rather than opposites.

That's definitely the book that

where I deal with that most directly.

But all of my work, I mean my recent young adult books,

are all about that as well.

About like, people..

Like Victories Greater than Death

is all about people learning

to kind of understand each other

so that they can join together

and solve huge intractable problems.

That's like a theme that's like,

that really resonates for me.

Yudha? A book of yours, I'd love to hear.

Huh. I'd say The Salvage Crew.

Since there's a bunch more stuff to come,

but I would definitely say The Salvage Crew,

which is about a C-tier crew of humans and an AI poet

who was once a human,

just dropped onto a planet with barely any resources.

One of the most horrible jobs

that a person can undertake in the universe.

And they end up meeting something other.

And that something other recognizes the AI poet,

not because of its machinery,

but because it's playing the language game.

I've sort of,

I think I've adopted the pessimism of the intellect,

optimism of the will approach in writing these things.

This panel is called Sci-fi IRL.

And I think a lot about the question

of whether our lives are science fictional.

Has technology science fictionalized our lives?

Is the future here, in some sense?

I'd be curious what each of you think.

Do you think we're living a science fictional reality?

Does that question even make sense?

I mean, science fiction has become

an incredibly mainstream form of entertainment,

whereas earlier in the 20th century,

it was kind of this marginal weird thing

that a bunch of dorks did.

And I'm not saying that dorks aren't still doing it,

like, Go, my dork brothers and sisters.

But I think that we like to imagine

that we're in a science fictional world

because that would be great

if we really were making the future come true that we want.

And I wanna bring this back to

what Charlie Jane was saying earlier about science fiction

kind of functioning as marketing sometimes?

I think this is a story we like to tell ourselves,

but it really masks some of the ways

that we're in fact not living in a shiny future.

And lots and lots of people don't have access

to the technology that we have

saturating this room right now.

So it's a wonderful fantasy.

I think many science fictional stories are something

that we should aspire to, but no,

we are not living in science fiction.

We're still stuck in the Middle Ages.

I mean, I said before

that science fiction is the literature of problem-solving.

I think science fiction is also the literature of change.

And to the extent that it feels like the world

is changing more rapidly,

that's when science fiction becomes more relevant.

But that's very subjective.

I want to add to what Annalee said, which is that yes,

we have this story saying

that science fiction is a predictive field, if you will.

But that claim is always a bit off

because to make that claim,

you kind of have to survey every piece

of science fiction ever written,

map out all the predictions there and say,

Yes, this percentage of predictions came true.

And if you did that,

I'll wager you'll find that the rate is actually quite low.

But I am going to give three anecdotes

as to why this does feel a little bit science fictiony

to me.

So firstly, so growing up,

I got access to the Internet in about 2012.

That was about the time that broadband

really arrived in Sri Lanka, right?

And until then it was this junkyard Pentium Two

and me trying to play Caesar Three on it.

And suddenly there was this thing

where I could go out and learn about things

that I would otherwise never have been able to.

And I suddenly felt like I had access to the sum total

of human knowledge at my fingertips.

The Internet as a whole, the connections that we have,

the fact that I'm presenting here

even though we are thousands of miles apart,

we are having this conversation.

I'm able to read people's books, they're able to read mine.

Many progresses,

that many sort of technological progressions

that we see do feel science fiction.

But it's uneven.

Where science fiction sort of the stuff that we looked to

as reference markers used to imagine better infrastructure.

And this is a thing that we really seem to have filled.

Better infrastructure for humans.

Not just concrete, but also better legal infrastructure,

better social infrastructure.

And we seem to have kind of shut the bed

on all those fronts.

What we do have is an incredibly advanced ARM cortex,

whatever processor and another 300 megabits of camera.

And those keep increasing at an incredible rate

that it's truly mind-boggling.

I just went out and bought a VR headset today.

I'm looking at it and going, Wow, this is amazing.

But so much of what we imagine,

so much of what we consider to be the common,

so much of what we consider to be essential

for the functioning of the civilization,

it seems like we've let those stagnate.

So it kind of feels like the architectural bedrock

of our civilization is still somewhere around the 1960s,

and we've just bolted on a bunch of stuff on top.

It is progress, yes.

But it's not really a holistic type of progress.

It's a very scattershot type of progress.

I'm hoping this leads to progress in other fields,

but it feels weird that our infrastructure is way behind

what it should be.

Our energy infrastructure is way behind what it should be.

Our ability to deal with climate change

is way behind what it should be.

Our progress on human rights, on norms,

on prevention of warfare,

these things have fallen pretty much,

and we just sort of just let them go, which feels odd.

So it's half-half.

Some parts of it are very futuristic.

Some parts of it are just,

Why? This just still feels like Cold War era stuff.

Okay, we have time for probably one more question.

So I have to ask about artificial intelligence,

which not only have you all written about.

You've all written about it before this current boom.

I mean Annalee's first book was called Autonomous.

Charlie Jane, you wrote a piece for Wired

about AI and journalism in 2020,

and maybe even 2018, I think?

Yudha, you wrote a piece about AI and advertising

for one of our science fiction packages.

So now that it's kind of come to pass in some form,

is this what you thought would happen when it happened?

How's it playing out from your perspective?

I mean, I don't think it has come to pass.

You mean corporations pretending that they have a product

that does things that it doesn't do?

Yeah, I thought that would happen.

Yeah. I am both excited,

and often like shaking my head itself.

So for The Salvage Crew, for example,

the main character was a machine poet.

So back then GPT-2 was pretty hot

and had just come off the press.

I retrained GPT-2 for the poetry of the machine poet

because it felt natural and I wanted to experiment

and I ended up building these little markup chain systems

for simulating weather and character events

and sort of sitting in the middle

of like a nest of half-baked R and Python programs

with things feeding information to me.

And it felt interesting.

Not my usual process, but interesting.

And then I saw the tilt,

which is where this went from being interesting and cool

and weird and experimental to,

Oh no, the crypto folks and the NFT people

have stumbled on this

and I'm now profoundly bored by the sheer number

of idiotic stuff coming out.

That being said,

I'm also extremely excited at what the open source community

is doing.

I see that as a lovely counterweight.

There's been incredible efforts by some people from,

particularly from Meta and so on and so forth,

releasing Llama, Mistral models,

the fine tunes on top of that,

Gerganov's work, the quantization stuff.

So I'm hoping that there's a future

where all this stuff comes back to the hands of people,

people being able to individually run their models

without necessarily having to open up Twitter

and see 100 crap skins on top of an open AI API.

Because that is a very boring and also kind of shit future.

Whereas the other direction is a little bit interesting.

The other direction is gaining traction again.

So I'm interested again.

Well, on that note,

please buy the books by these three writers.

They really are some of the most exciting writers

in the genre today.

And so please give them a round of applause.

[audience applauding]

Thank you, Yudha. Thank you.",technology
"When Abdullah Abu Nada, a chemist who was at work in Gaza City, heard that the building where his family was staying had been hit by an airstrike, he texted his wife, Samah. She didn’t reply, and Abu Nada then called his 15-year-old son, Ahmed. When his son didn’t answer, Abu Nada called his 16-year-old daughter, Nawal. She didn’t answer, either. All three of them — as well as the two other Abu Nada children: Anas, 12, and Mohammed, 8 — had been killed in the airstrike.

"Initially envisioned as a way for the Ukrainians to forge new contacts and commitments with the U.S. defense industry to bolster Kyiv’s ability to build its own weapons, the meetings have taken on a deeper importance as the Biden administration pressures Congress to pass a $60 billion aid package, and as questions swirl over next steps in the war.

The big names running the meetings reflect its ambitions, with around 350 U.S., Ukrainian and European industry and government representatives slated to attend the closed-door sessions that will feature the national armaments directors from across the 50 nations that have banded together to supply Ukraine. They’ll be meeting with the Pentagon’s acquisition chief, William LaPlante.

The first day of what’s been dubbed the U.S.-Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference will be led by national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and senior Ukrainian officials. The second day “will focus on business-to-business networking and cooperation,” according to a National Security Council spokesperson.

Speaking in Kyiv last month, Yermak called the Washington trip “extremely important for our defense industry. The event will be attended by representatives of several dozen domestic enterprises, both [Ukrainian] state-owned and private. Even more companies are from the United States.”

The goal for the government in Kyiv is to move away from relying on the largesse of partners abroad to rebuilding its own defense industry and eventually becoming an exporter of drones and other equipment that Ukrainian engineers have focused on since the Russian invasion.

The visit comes as Ukrainian forces are grinding through the second bloody winter of battling entrenched Russian troops.

Yet the mood is different this year. Last winter, confidence was high over the anticipated springtime offensives, and the supposed ragged state of Russian morale was thought to presage a more successful counterpunch than Ukraine managed to achieve. This December the outlook is more muted, given months of static frontline fighting across hundreds of miles of farmland that has turned the war into an artillery slugfest over yards of muddy earth.

In order to break the stalemate while protecting Ukrainian critical infrastructure from Russian ballistic missile and drone attacks, air defenses are at the top of Ukraine’s list of equipment it needs from allies for the winter months, led by short-range radars.

Specifically, Kyiv is looking for Sentinel short-range radars that are designed to track ballistic missiles, slower-moving drones and fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft — and a lot in between, according to a person familiar with the U.S.-Ukraine discussions, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Kyiv is also seeking 155mm and 152mm ammunition and 120mm Grad air defense rockets. Plus, it wants smaller counterbattery radars that frontline units can use to locate the source of Russian mortar and short-range missile fire.

“We understand Russia will use missiles against us this winter but they are just waiting for the cold weather to target our gas and electric sites,” said Ukrainian parliamentarian Yehor Cherniev, deputy chair of the Committee on National Security, Defence and Intelligence, on the sidelines of the Halifax International Security Forum last month.

“One of our key points when we were in Washington for meetings was that we don’t want to have fish, but have the tools to catch the fish,” Cherniev said. Two European defense contractors have already pledged their commitment to begin work in Ukraine, though no U.S. manufacturers have followed suit. Rheinmetall, the German arms giant, has said it would work with Ukraine’s state arms company, Ukroboronprom, to build tanks and armored vehicles, and British-based BAE has also announced it is opening an office in Kyiv and could begin making 105mm guns in Ukraine.

It’s a different approach from last December, when Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range U.S. and U.K. missiles were at the top of Kyiv’s list of requests. At that point in the war, Ukrainian leaders were fresh from their shockingly successful fall counteroffensive that swept Russian troops from hundreds of square miles of ground throughout the east and south, and they promised with refitting and restocking over the winter, they would repeat their success in the spring.

That didn’t happen despite a summer of brutal combat against entrenched Russian forces, with columns of new Western armor and longer-rage missiles proving effective — but not effective enough — against a fortified and dug-in enemy.

With the fate of $60 billion in weapons and other aid still stalled in Congress, and less than $5 billion left in authority for President Joe Biden to transfer more weapons and equipment from U.S. shelves, Kyiv is eager to get that package passed before messy American presidential election politics intervene to slow things down, or potentially cut off aid.

In a change from previous meetings, Ukrainian leaders have shifted from publicly demanding the donation of major weapons systems. Instead, they are using their energy to assure Western allies they’re ready for a long fight that they hope will be insulated from Western politics and tied more closely with the global defense industry.

One recent assault illustrated the shift. An attack by multiple Ukrainian-made drones targeted power generation sites in the Russian-occupied east, a tactic learned from the Russians who have been trying to turn out the lights in Kyiv since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The Ukrainian assault was a modest success, managing to shut off the power in several occupied towns. But the message it sent was more lasting: Kyiv would continue to push through the winter to exert new pressures on the Russian forces occupying its territory, and it now had the means to do so.

Ukraine has poured millions of dollars into its short- and medium-range drone programs in recent months, identifying it as a place where investments could pay off quickly. In the process they have bought up commercial drones from across the globe to use on one-way missions and to drop small ordnance on Russian troops, an effort recently matched by Russia, creating a deadly new drone war across hundreds of miles of entrenched front lines.

The war over the electric grid is likely only getting started, however, as Ukrainian officials have noted for weeks that Russian missile strikes on the capital have become suspiciously less frequent, sparking concerns that Moscow is hoarding its missiles and Iranian drones for bigger, harder-to-defend attacks this winter aimed at freezing out civilians in Kyiv and other major cities.

“Russia will most probably continue to attack the energy infrastructure” throughout the winter, said Pavel Verkhniatskyi, managing partner at COSA Intelligence Solutions in Kyiv. “On the one hand, they gathered quite a number of missiles and drones and adapted their tactics, but on the other, we have more air defense this time and we have also learned a lot throughout the war.”

Those lessons have come at a heavy cost. Holding out for so long while unable to strike a decisive blow against occupying Russian forces has made the endgame for the war less clear, which has led to some nervousness in Europe and Washington over how long their military support can continue as defense industries struggle to increase production.

“We already feel the lack of these resources,” said Cherniev, the Ukrainian lawmaker, “because the packages [from the U.S.] now become less and less, smaller and smaller. But the intensity of this war is not, will not become any less.”",political
"Baldur’s Gate 3, which just won Game of the Year at the 2023 Game Awards, is now available to purchase on Xbox Series X and S. You can buy it now for $69.99.

The Xbox version of the game has been in the works for a little while. A few weeks after the hugely-successful PC launch of the game in August — and just before the release of the PS5 version — Larian Studios announced that it would be bringing Baldur’s Gate 3 to Microsoft’s consoles, though without split-screen co-op on the Xbox Series S.

At the time, Larian also said the Xbox version only allows cross-save between the Steam and Xbox Series consoles, so if you’re hoping to move your PS5 save over to Xbox, you may be out of luck. (Although I’m sure somebody will test the PS5 to Steam to Xbox pipeline for saves, and I hope that works.)",technology
"“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.

Cox’s attorneys have said they will not share her abortion plans, citing concerns for her safety. In a filing with the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, her attorneys indicated she was still pregnant.

Cox was 20 weeks pregnant this week when she filed what is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that overturned Roe v. Wade. The order issued Thursday only applied to Cox and no other pregnant Texas women.

Cox learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to her lawsuit.

Furthermore, doctors have told Cox that if the baby’s heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her two prior cesareans sections, and that another C-section at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox does not meet the criteria for a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban, and he urged the state’s highest court to act swiftly.

“Future criminal and civil proceedings cannot restore the life that is lost if Plaintiffs or their agents proceed to perform and procure an abortion in violation of Texas law,” Paxton’s office told the court.

He also warned three hospitals in Houston that they could face legal consequences if they allowed Cox’s physician to provide the abortion, despite the ruling from state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, who Paxton called an “activist” judge.

On Friday, a pregnant Kentucky woman also filed a lawsuit demanding the right to an abortion. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is about eight weeks pregnant and she wants to have an abortion in Kentucky but cannot legally do so because of the state’s ban, the suit said.

Unlike Cox’s lawsuit, the Kentucky challenge seeks class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion.",political
"The State Department is pushing through a government sale to Israel of 13,000 rounds of tank ammunition, bypassing a congressional review process that is generally required for arms sales to foreign nations, according to a State Department official and an online post by the Defense Department on Saturday.

The State Department notified congressional committees at 11 p.m. on Friday that it was moving ahead with the sale, valued at more than $106 million, even though Congress had not finished an informal review of a larger order from Israel for tank rounds.

The department invoked an emergency provision in the Arms Export Control Act, the State Department official and a congressional official told The New York Times. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivities over the sales. The arms shipment has been put on an expedited track, and Congress has no power to stop it.

The Defense Department posted a notification of the sale before noon on Saturday. It said Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had informed Congress on Friday that “an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale.”

It is the first time that the State Department had invoked the emergency provision for an arms shipment to the Middle East since May 2019, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo approved weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a move that was criticized by lawmakers and some career officials inside the State Department.

The State Department has used the emergency provision at least two times since 2022 to rush arms to Ukraine for its defense against Russia’s invasion.

But in the case of the Israel-Gaza war, there has been growing condemnation in the United States and abroad of the way Israel is carrying out its offensive. The State Department’s decision to bypass Congress appeared to reflect an awareness of some Democratic lawmakers’ criticism of the Biden administration for supplying arms to Israel with no conditions or scrutiny.

Israeli airstrikes and ground operations have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and about 40 percent of those fatalities have been children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The war started on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched cross-border attacks in Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and abducting about 240 others, according to Israeli authorities.

Thirteen Democratic senators announced Thursday that they were working on legislation to require greater evidence from nations receiving U.S. weapons that their militaries are not committing war crimes.

The sale is certain to infuriate Arab leaders, who have sharply criticized the Biden administration’s efforts to block international attempts, including in the United Nations, to pressure Israel for an immediate long-term cease-fire.

“The combination of the United States’ veto of a cease-fire resolution in the U.N., and this expedited provision of lethal arms to Israel, should cause some serious consideration of whether the secretary’s repeated assertions that the U.S. seeks to minimize civilian casualties in Israel’s operation in Gaza are sincere,” said Josh Paul, a former State Department official who worked on arms sales, referring to Mr. Blinken. (Mr. Paul resigned from the agency in October over U.S. weapons aid to Israel for its use in the Gaza war.)

The 13,000 rounds are one tranche of a larger order from Israel of 45,000 rounds of ammunition for Merkava tanks that the State Department aims to approve, but that is under informal review by two congressional committees that have oversight of arms sales, congressional officials said. The total order is valued at more than $500 million. The New York Times and Reuters reported Friday on the order from Israel.

During the informal review process, committee members can ask the State Department questions about the weapons sale, in particular how the arms will be used and whether the purchaser will work to lessen civilian casualties. Once the relevant committees sign off, the State Department issues a formal notification to Congress of the sales.

“Congressional review is a critical step for examining any large arms sale,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said in a statement to The Times on Saturday, after being asked about the State Department’s expedited approval. “The administration’s decision to short-circuit what is already a quick time frame for congressional review undermines transparency and weakens accountability. The public deserves better.”

Although most of the civilian casualties in Gaza are caused by heavy Israeli airstrikes, some Palestinian journalists have taken video footage or photographs of what they say are Israeli armored vehicles firing on civilians.

And on Thursday, the Reuters news agency published an investigation that concluded a strike by an Israeli tank crew had killed one of its video journalists, Issam Abdallah, in South Lebanon on Oct. 13. The strike severely injured an Agence France-Presse photographer, Christina Assi, and wounded five other journalists.

“Issam was not in an active combat zone when he was struck,” Reuters said in a statement. “He and his colleagues were alongside journalists from other news outlets, in an area far from active conflict.”

Human Rights Watch, which did its own investigation, and Amnesty International both called the attack a war crime.

The Israeli military says it does not target civilians. In the case of the tank strike that killed Mr. Abdallah and injured the others, it has argued they were in a conflict area, despite there being no evidence of combatants or fighting around the journalists at the time.

On Thursday, Mr. Blinken said at a news conference that “it is imperative — it remains imperative — that Israel put a premium on civilian protection, and there does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground.”",political

[audience clapping]

All right.

Please welcome Suresh Singh,

Tiffany Williams, Chris Helfrich, and Eric Peyton.

[people chattering distantly]

[audience clapping]

[host speaking indistinctly]

[people chattering distantly]

Hi.

[people chattering distantly]

Hi there!

Hello.

Hi, so Suresh, the Chairman of 30 Ink, correct?

Correct.

Correct?

And Tiffany Williams, the COO of 30 Ink.

Chris Helfrich, the CEO of Eat.Learn.Play. Foundation,

and then Eric,

the Chief Creative Officer of Unanimous Media.

Alright, [chuckling] great.

Well, I am very glad

that you guys were able to join us,

I really appreciate it.

And as always, am glad

that Steph was able to at least like come talk to us

for a little bit, even though I know he's very busy

with the season and everything.

I really wanna start, first of all,

and Suresh, I'm gonna direct this question at you first.

We hear a lot about kind of buzzwords like profit for good.

I was hoping that maybe you could talk us

through a little bit about what 30 Ink is,

but what does profit for good actually mean?

Well, I think profit for good

exists on so many levels today,

it's not a novel thing at all.

EVs, they are countless businesses, affordable housing.

There are a lot of businesses that deliver

incredible assets to human beings.

That they need and they make money from them.

Stephen's approach here is to elevate underrepresented,

underestimated people in our communities today.

And utilize that as a primary asset to create

businesses like Underrated Golf, for example.

Right.

And to Tiffany, let me direct this to you for a second?

How do you, as a chief operating officer,

like your job is to kind of make sure

all of this stuff actually happens?

How do you make sure

that this goes beyond just good intentions?

Yeah, well, it's definitely a team effort.

I'm working with each of the leads of the organizations

to ensure that we set out with these good intentions,

but to ensure that we're following through,

making sure that, Stephen has done this

for over 15 years.

And as Chris will speak to a little bit later,

giving back has always been a part of his mission.

And so, it's really being intentional,

and making sure that

we are following through with our goals.

Which is sometimes, can be harder.

than it sounds on paper, I think.

And I'll dig into that a little bit in a minute,

but I wanna ask Eric too, Eric,

when you, as a Chief Creative Officer of Unanimous Media,

how are you aligning your vision

with like creative projects that you're choosing?

Yeah, I mean I think it starts from Steph.

I think it's really about

him trying to inspire through media,

that's what Unanimous is all about,

inspiring through media with three different silos,

that's family, faith, and sports.

And so, aligning the vision was started from day one.

When we started the company,

we sat down and we talked

about how he wanted to enter the media space,

and inspiration was the key word.

And so, that's what we try to do.

We try to inspire through every project,

we try to inspire it through, even packaging projects,

we try to inspire through the people that we work with,

the rooms that we enter.

And so, I think when you think about aligning on the vision,

it really starts with him and his goals,

which is inspiring through everything that he does, so.

And if I can add into there.

Yeah! Go ahead.

It all sounds amazing.

It all sounds like it can be philanthropic.

But we have, like every business,

it's really easy to lose money.

Mm-hmm. [laughing]

Harder to break even.

And really hard to make money.

So, we have a very strong fiscal discipline as well.

So, this isn't just about doing the right thing,

doing the inspiring projects,

but we make sure that those inspiring projects can be sold,

that people actually wanna watch them and enjoy them.

Yeah.

There's a little bit of a probably productive tension here

in terms of being able to push out,

not so much that you're not saying yes to things,

but I imagine that there are things that you have to

say no to that might make money,

but might not align with the vision.

100%

I don't know,

I don't know if- No,

listen- That's Eric question, or.

Absolutely, those are

the hard conversations to have, right?

I mean, in Hollywood, sometimes the things

that are trending, true crime and horror,

and things like that, those don't necessarily align

with us most of the time.

So yeah, it is tough,

but I think that's what makes not only 30 Ink special,

is a discipline to be able to say no,

but also, Unanimous special as well,

so trying to use that no as a superpower

is one of the keys.

Chris, with Eat.Learn.Play,

what are some practical ways that this plays out

in your organization?

Well, so I mean,

we're the not-for-profit arm

[host laughing]

of Stephen and Aisha's entities.

But for us, the way that it plays out

when we were founded in 2019, the promise

that the Currys made was to forever fund

the organization's fundraising,

administrative overhead costs, right?

[Host] Right.

We only can do that

because of the success of 30 Ink, and the profit

that they generate.

So, that gives us a real superpower, right?

In terms of being able to bring people together, fundraise,

to have this impact that we want to have, right?

We've done a lot since we were founded in 2019,

but the way that Unanimous shows up

for Eat.Learn.Play, and helping us tell stories

the way that Suresh and Tiffany,

with the brand partners of Stephen's rally

behind the work that we do,

and allow us to do more has been like,

it's helped energize and give so much momentum

to the work that we're doing.

We, in September, made a big commitment

after a long period of strategic planning,

where we are looking to raise and invest

over the next couple years, $50 million.

[Host] Wow.

Into improving, transforming the school experience

for a generation of Oakland kids.

But this engine of 30 Ink and the partners,

it helps to drive big goals like that

that will have a lot of impact.

Altruism, but with a very tight focus.

So, one of the questions here, I know that you are looking

to generate like $50 million in investment,

to give back to communities.

There is an inherent tension here

in terms of how much private philanthropy

can do against lack of public funding

or public policy.

How are you navigating that tension?

When do you decide?

Maybe Tiffany, this is for you

or Suresh, I'm not sure.

But how do you decide like when public policy

needs to come in?

Do your organizations focus on that?

I'll jump in on this one.

We don't focus on it.

[Host] Okay.

Because the level of bureaucracy,

the pace, just cannot keep up with us.

We think way faster.

And we want to implement way faster.

So, in the relatively near future,

you'll see Stephen coming out with affordable housing.

But it'll be private run,

it'll be completely private-driven, it'll be profitable.

But we won't be looking at government for grants and loans,

and all of that because it just bogs down the process.

And we can't see how that that's [chuckling] gonna change.

No, I think that's a fair question.

And I think that within the Oakland community specifically,

it's a source of tension,

but there is a way around it

to which is kind of with Eat.Learn.Play.

Chris, you're nodding your head.

Yeah, I mean, our model at Eat.Learn.Play is to,

right?

Well, I go back to Stephen Curry

and what makes him special.

Like, I think one of those words that is often used

to describe Steph is authentic, right?

And for us, we know that public policy

is going to be key, right?

In terms of making sure that every kid has access

to nutritious food, and becomes a competent,

great reader at the right levels,

and has great places to play and be active.

We know that government plays a critical role there,

and we can't do it all ourselves,

but what's authentic to us is to do the work first

in the community, right?

Establish a proof point through the work that we do,

so that we do have skin in the game,

and can point to the success

that we're having to government, right?

In terms of here's what's needed

for this change to be sustainable.

But our attitude is do the work first,

and then use our voice.

We help to provide

over 25 million meals to Oakland kids and families

during the pandemic, right?

And it was only on the strength of that

that we had Aisha, right?

Our co-founder,

testify before Congress on ending childhood hunger

in the country.

And so, it's a part of our playbook,

but the direct impact comes first.

Got it.

Tiffany, question for you.

What kind of compromises have you had to make

in terms of running this organization?

There really haven't been too many

that we would call compromises.

I think that there's times when we may end relationships

with a brand partner that, as we kind of go further,

and we've grown as a business,

we maybe don't align as much as we did in the beginning,

and we still keep that relationship,

and maybe sometimes

push the relationship overseas, not push,

but connect them with ELP,

so that [all laughing]

we connect them with ELP- Keep yourself away.

Because there may be more alignment in that area.

But I think that

we've been very blessed

to have an opportunity to kind of send,

Stephen has to choose those opportunities

and make sure that it meets the values,

and where we are today,

and what we're trying to accomplish now.

So, I think that the business has grown so much

that there are sometimes places within our enterprise,

where we can kind of match those things.

But we really are very intentional about

what we are trying to create,

and elevating the under,

and really, we aren't gonna compromise that.

But that means saying no, right?

Yes- That means saying no.

Yes, yeah.

I'm gonna hop in again

with Tiffany and her team, [Tiffany chuckling]

they've been incredibly successful

in evolving those relationships.

Sometimes, it's been taking a pause from them,

and that they want to come back, and they come back,

and Tiffany and the team convince them to do things

that they have to do things differently.

And they do, and I won't.

Or, even sometimes, it's just really resetting,

Rakuten has been a partner of ours for many years now,

and we sat down with them

this past spring, because we've been working with them

for many years,

and it was kind of your standard endorsement contract,

X amount of production hours.

And we really wanted to do something

within the community,

Elevating the under as our motto.

And so, we sat down, went over our values, went over theirs,

and we found a place,

and that's how elevating the black designers came about,

working with- Oh nice!

The Black and Fashion Council,

and Stephen being able to showcase those

in his tunnel walk.

So, it's really taking a pause,

sometimes resetting or sometimes moving on,

or maybe finding another opportunity within the group.

Yeah.

And it seems like that is one of the huge assets

with 30 Ink,

is that there are different places for brands to go.

It isn't just one thing.

One question for the group kind of,

and maybe Eric, if you wanted to speak on this a little bit,

there seems to be specifically in Hollywood, right?

Like, we went through an entire,

it felt like maybe two years ago,

diversity inclusion was really at the forefront,

there was a huge spotlight on it.

And I don't think I'm mistaken here,

but that seems to have faded

from the headlines a little bit.

Are you finding that like,

people's commitments to that is faltering?

Yeah, I do think the commitment is altering.

And I think that's what, to go back to our vision

and our purpose, and our impact,

and our superpower sort of at Unanimous,

and it's really to create those pathways

for those folks.

I think it's like, we want to have diverse writers,

we want to have diverse showrunners,

we want to have diverse creatives.

I think a lot of times when we hop on these Zooms,

we see all the same types of people,

or when we go to the studios to pitch,

we see all the same types, and the work's not done there.

Absolutely not.

And so, yeah, you do see people stepping back from it.

And

that's when you really have to push forward

as the leader of Unanimous,

and that's what I tell my team is like, keep pushing.

[Host] How do you nudge people in that direction though?

How do you nudge them without kind of pushing them away?

Look, for us, it's creative, right?

So, if you can find a piece of creative that is undeniable,

that's how you nudge, right?

I think you can also position the people at lower levels,

and make sure the talent pool is there.

I think, she's not here now,

but Tiffany's sister Tracy, who helps us with HR,

we work together to really try to create a pool of talent.

So, when there is those opportunities, there's people

that can fulfill those opportunities

within all the aspects of media.

And so, I think that's how you nudge.

And then, sometimes, with Suresh,

you just say it. [laughing]

[Host] Yeah, I hear you.

[voices drown]

You know?

You just say it, you say, you say this what we're lookin' at

right here [chuckling]

is not right, and we expect to change,

and we can have a conversation of how we get there,

we have tools how to get there,

and we can have an honest conversation

simply and transparently.

Suresh, tell me about a time

when you've had to be more direct.

Well, we were interviewing creative brand agencies

to help us identify ourselves.

And I'm not great at explaining exactly what they do,

but [host and Suresh chuckling]

[people chattering distantly]

we wanted a black-owned, or at least the leadership,

and the people that were working with us

to look like us!

Right!

And one of the groups, spectacular presentation,

but at the very end of it, I said, we have, what,

10, 12 people on the screen, and none of y'all look like us.

Ugh! [indistinct] So, that is going

to have to change,

otherwise, there's no need for another conversation.

So, we definitely, on our side with Tiffany,

we take the bully pulpit approach sometimes.

And if that means they have to find the resources

or utilize resources that we have,

they have, and they've done it,

and now they keep going back to those resources

because they were successful.

We get hit

with this concept of the brightest and best.

Steph's vision is, we don't know who

the brightest and best are yet.

'Cause we haven't had representation from everybody

if he's an athlete,

so let's look at sport over the last a hundred years.

We're now seeing

where sport can go when everyone can participate.

Mm-hmm.

Not like.

I think one part of that analogy

that really, a lot of people overlook is that like,

Steph had to practice a lot to get to where he is.

It's not like you can just put somebody in this role

and expect them to like drain threes overnight, right?

Like, there is a lot of practice,

there is a lot of evolution,

and there is a lot of investment and talent

that is often overlooked, yeah.

Let me stop, we're just running short on time.

But I do want to ask either, if anybody wants to toss it out

or Chris, maybe even just for you,

what are the, ooh, excuse me.

What are the tangible results that you're seeing here?

I mean, like, delivering meals

is one thing, producing documentaries,

like what else is happening that makes you think,

okay, we're on the right track here?

Yeah, well there's from Eat.Learn.Play's perspective

in our work in Oakland, I mean, there's a lot, right?

And we don't have time for all of them.

One of the big priority areas for us

that's gotten the most traction,

I think had a lot of impact is in our work

with the school district,

we have set out to remodel over the next couple years,

25 school yards.

[Host] Oh wow.

In Oakland Elementary School.

So, this is where kids are spending one or two hours a day,

and it's really blacktops and fences, not much else,

some basketball hoops.

And Stephen and Aisha had this vision

that we're bringing to life

to transform these places to be magical schoolyards

where kids can play and learn,

and spend time with their friends.

So, soccer pitches and basketball courts

and nature exploration areas, gardens, murals,

kids designing their dream playgrounds, you name it.

So, we've done 10 of these already.

And the feedback's been amazing,

but at this big event we had with the Currys in September,

there was a girl

who got to play

on the schoolyard for the first time, a student,

a second grader.

And she approached her teacher

with tears in her eyes, concerned,

asking if she was gonna have to find a new school.

[Host] Oh no!

Because for her,

and like, I think it's a deficit mindset

that exists in Oakland in a lot of places.

It's like, this amazing place can't possibly be for me,

it has to be for other kids.

[host gasping]

Right?

And I think for us at Eat.Learn.Play., it underscores

why Stephen and Aisha built this in the first place,

it's 'cause these kids do deserve it.

And they do deserve these opportunities.

And so, a story like that,

and there's lots of 'em, motivate us

to just do whatever we can

to change the possibilities for these kids.

That is a little heartbreaking, I'm not gonna lie, yeah.

I mean, it sounds like

there's lots of great things coming up,

and I don't know, Eric, if there are any Unanimous projects

that we should be looking forward to.

We got a lot of things in the works for sure.

We're unfortunately, I can't announce too many things,

but yeah, we have a major animated film comin' out.

We're doin' a project.

Our next big feature doc is with an athlete

that used to wear the number three

[Host] that played for Philadelphia- Oh!

Interesting. [laughing]

So, I think that's exciting.

And so,

there's a lot, there's a lot.

Well, that's great,

well, thank you all so much, Chris,

Eric, Tiffany, Suresh.

Appreciate it very much.

Thank you- And tell Steph

thank you as well.

Thank you.

Thank you.

"Clionadh Raleigh is President and CEO of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.

When Hamas fighters attacked Israel on October 7, they didn’t just target Israeli army bases or civilian towns and homes. They also struck a weak spot in the popular perception of war: a global fixation on fatality figures.

Hamas’ apparent order of the day — to kill and capture as many Israelis as possible, whether military or civilian – was a terrorist act by any definition, and its brutality multiplied the shock. However, it would be a mistake to call this nihilism, as United States President Joe Biden did in an editorial. For as both Biden and Hamas know, in many cases, people only notice a conflict when struck by a death toll.

I say this because it’s my job to count. It was the astonishing unreliability of fatality statistics that years ago coaxed me to start collecting data on political violence in six African countries. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which grew out of that work, now tracks 243 countries and territories worldwide. And over the years, we’ve recorded over 1.5 million instances of political violence and protest events, making them publicly available for anyone to search and see — including fatality estimates.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned on my journey through the statistics of global conflict, it’s that fatality counts are usually the most inaccurate measures of violence. They’re biased, often taken out of context, and far more people are exposed to conflict than are killed.

Only the most trusted sources should be used for death tolls, and the most conservative estimates are often the most accurate. Thus, we must constantly update our criteria, sources and assumptions.

In my early interviews with local African officials, trying to get to the bottom of conflict reports, I often heard that the time, place and location of a reported event was correct. However, fatality reports varied greatly, and some individuals even admitted they had made them up for reasons like receiving money from their capitals, troops from headquarters or attention from faraway media.

And these local officials were right: The bigger the claimed death toll, the more attention they got. We struggle with aggregate death tolls resulting from authorities rounding up numbers to end in several zeros. And because they are “official,” and can’t be proved or disproved, these “zombie death tolls” quickly take on a life of their own.

For example, in his article on the Gaza conflict, Biden cited the Israeli civilian death toll at 1,200, but didn’t mention the quickly growing number of Palestinian deaths, which he later stated he had “no confidence” in. By then, the Hamas-aligned Palestinian Ministry of Health had counted 11,675 Palestinians killed in Gaza since October 7. ACLED’s provisional count for that time period is 8,754 for Gaza and the West Bank, and 1,189 for Israel — but our figures will rise as we’re able to link fatalities to specific events.

Biden’s choice of data underlines the point that as the political temperature climbs, fatality figures just become part of the conflict itself. And the weaponization of death tolls only exposes and deepens existing divisions rather than change minds or help resolve conflicts.

When planning its October 7 attacks, Hamas must have expected the furious Israeli bombing of Gaza and hoped that this would put the militant group itself, its goals and Palestine back on the global agenda. And if so, its gamble on the lives of its own civilians has paid off: By ACLED’s count, 90 percent of some 4,200 demonstrations around the world this last month were pro-Palestine.

Hamas may be losing the conflict, but it’s winning the argument.

I want our statistics to help build a more peaceful world and offer clarity by recognizing the differences between violent conflicts.

In our 2023 Conflict Index (updated prior to the Hamas attacks), Ukraine was the deadliest country in terms of accumulated fatalities, but our metrics also highlighted conflicts that many miss. For example, the number of active armed groups propelled Myanmar to the top of the overall list. Meanwhile, Mexico was the most dangerous country for civilians, measured by the number of direct attacks on unarmed groups and individuals.

Crucially, however, Palestine topped the list of places with the widest diffusion of conflict. High levels of violence — mostly confrontations between Palestinians and Israelis — had affected over 60 percent of Palestinian territory. Yet, at the same time, fatalities were relatively low. And tragically, while this was a clear warning sign in the data, it was one that most people ignored.",political
"Things are about to get a little bit wild in the world of Monster Hunter. At The Game Awards this evening, Capcom revealed the latest entry in the franchise: Monster Hunter Wilds.

There aren’t a lot of details yet about what makes this one different from past MonHun titles, and the game isn’t expected to launch until 2025. It’s slated for the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X / S. There’s at least a very beautiful trailer to watch full of lots of mounts to ride and monsters to hunt (obviously). More news on Wilds is expected in the summer of 2024.",technology
"News unions have expanded their footprints in the last couple of years, organizing longtime holdouts like the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and a dozen Gannett newsrooms, as well as most top news websites and magazines (Slate, Vice, HuffPost, POLITICO, The Atlantic, Esquire, The New Yorker, New York, Washingtonian, et al.). But the successes can’t mask the newspaper industry’s death spiral. Post workers may well win a new contract, secure desired workplace enhancements and collect raises if they keep at it. But the victory may prove Pyrrhic as the newspaper industry’s dim and dark present unfolds into its future.

According to a Thursday Post piece about the Post strike, labor and management aren’t even talking the same language. Workers have not had a contract for 18 months. The Guild wants a minimum salary of $100,100 for reporters, and management is offering only $73,000. The parties are also separated by annual cost-of-living demands.

Seeing as it’s only money they’re talking about, Bezos could buy every newsroom employee a $4 million home in the Hollywood Hills or thereabouts, give each $1 million in walking around money and make a bonfire on Malibu beach of $1 billion just to celebrate his generosity, and he’d still have $165 billion in his pocket. But that’s not how Bezos thinks. He counts every penny and fights unions hard wherever they appear in his kingdom. Since buying the money-losing Post a decade ago for a mere $250 million, he’s been adamant about not running the paper as a philanthropy. Instead, he invested untold millions to reverse the newsroom headcount decline, expanding it by more than a third and adding new foreign bureaus, too. And miracle of miracles, he succeeded in making the paper profitable as recently as 2019.

Bezos said at the outset that he also planned to make the Post a “national and even global publication.” While his millions improved what he inherited, he still hasn’t made it a national or global read on par with the Times. It may be that there is room in the marketplace for only one national and global publication, and the New York Times has already claimed it.

Meanwhile, for all of Bezos’ ambitions to build a profitable paper, the Post is now projected to lose $100 million this year. Such loses don’t encourage bosses like Bezos to give raises or prevent them from trimming staff. You can blame red ink on the stewardship of outgoing publisher Fred Ryan, or you can attribute it to the end of the “Trump Bump.” (After Donald Trump left the White House the paper’s digital subscriptions declined to about 2.5 million from 3 million.) Or you could lay it on Executive Editor Sally Buzbee, who arrived in spring 2021 and isn’t the sort of news impresario predecessor Marty Baron was. Or you could opt for the unified field theory and blame it all on the irreversible decline of the newspaper industry.

As press baron Rupert Murdoch once said, newspapers are “rivers of gold.” But as he also later acknowledged, “Sometimes rivers dry up.” After a decade of supporting and expanding the paper, Bezos must fear that his entire newspaper investment will be swept out to sea. That’s not fearmongering. Newspaper trend lines are cratering and may prove to be too steep for Bezos’ tastes. According to the Pew Research Center, national weekday circulation peaked in 1972 at 63 million and has recently fallen to below 21 million. Newspaper advertising revenue peaked in 2006 at $49 billion and has now dropped below $10 billion, with only about 50 percent of it coming from the digital side. Meanwhile, Google alone pulls in about $76 billion in U.S. ad revenue a year.

Not only are the industry’s revenues and circulation gone to swirl in the toilet, but there are also fewer newspaper newsroom workers to organize. According to Pew Research, total newspaper newsroom jobs fell 57 percent between 2008 and 2020, and those losses are predicted to continue in the coming years.

Organized labor may have conquered the newspaper newsroom, but they’ve inherited an empire in near ruins.

"One of the best portable DACs will make a major difference to the way you listen to music. But if you're not sure what a DAC is, you're not alone. A DAC (a digital to analog converter) is a device that translates the digital audio information from a phone or laptop into the analog sound that you hear when you listen to music.

Of course, you don't need a separate DAC to get music from your device (read: phone, laptop, tablet, digital music player). There's one already built-in – there needs to be because humans can't hear digital signals. It enables you to hear the analog sound made by your favorite bands and artists instead of the digital file that lets you store it on a device in file formats such as MP3, FLAC, Sony's DSD or Apple's Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) – but not all DACs are created equal.

Converting digital to analogue is a big job, and one which the built-in DAC in your device might not do well. When you consider the cost of your phone and the sum of all its parts, the value of the DAC inside can't amount to much. That's why a dedicated device, like one of the portable DACs in this guide, is a good idea. The music you hear through your headphones will bypass the converter in your device and head straight to the standalone option. The result is music that sounds crisper, clearer, more agile and just better compared to leaving this crucial converting process in the hands of the inexpensive DAC chip in your phone, tablet or laptop.

In our list below, you'll find our pick of the best DACs, which we've spent time testing to make sure they offer audiophile-grade sound and some handy features, too, such as driving two headphones at once or offering wireless capabilities. If you're serious about music, keep reading.

The best portable DAC overall

(Image credit: TechRadar)

1. Chord Mojo 2 The best portable DAC overall Our expert review: Specifications Inputs: Five digital inputs: coaxial, dual-data coax, optical, Micro-USB and USB-C Outputs: 2 x 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 23 x 83 x 62mm / 185g Sample rate: Up to 768kHz Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Eloquent, engaging and endlessly listenable sound + Extensive specs and lots of input options + Can drive two pairs of headphones at once Reasons to avoid - Staggeringly unintuitive interface - A bit big and heavy to be a truly mobile device

The original Chord Mojo DAC was at the top of our best portable DAC list for a long time, but it's been replaced by the Chord Mojo DAC 2. Replacing a product that’s borderline iconic can’t be easy - which is maybe why it’s taken Chord Electronics seven years to replace its original Mojo DAC / headphone amp.

The Chord Mojo DAC 2 is very easy to use. All you need to do is hook a digital source into one end of the device, and some wired headphones into the other.

During testing, we found this to be a brilliantly accomplished device, able to deliver all the musicality, all the detail, all the refinement and all the excitement hidden in what previously sounded like quite humdrum digital audio files. In pure performance terms, the Chord Mojo 2 almost constitutes a bargain.

But there are several drawbacks, too. The Mojo 2 is bulky (the same size and weight as the original it's replacing) and it doesn't have wireless connectivity. What's more, its control interface can be confusing.

2. iFi Uno The best budget portable DAC Our expert review: Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 1 x 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 88 x 81 x 26mm (150g) Sample rate: Up to 384kHz Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Robust, confident and informative sound + Excellent specification for the money + Usefully compact Reasons to avoid - Lopsided output at very low volumes - Can sound slightly edgy at bigger volumes

The iFi Uno DAC is one of the most affordable options on our list, but during our testing we were surprised to find that the improvements it makes to your sound experience are massive.

We learned that, as long as you don’t intend to listen at either very quiet or very loud volume levels, the sound of your laptop once the Uno is plugged in is improved dramatically. We think even those who don't consider themselves audiophiles will recognize the improvement and agree that it's up there with the best portable DACs.

In our iFi Uno review we commended this portable DAC for its detail retrieval, low-frequency extension, sound staging, transient response and stereo focus. These are all essential qualities that go towards delivering a genuinely enjoyable and convincing sound reproduction.

3. Helm Audio Bolt The best mid-range portable DAC Our expert review: Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 1 x 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 101.6 x 6.4 x 6.4 mm (28.35g) Sample rate: 32bit/384kHz Reasons to buy + Punchy and deft audio performance + As portable as can be + Properly made Reasons to avoid - Minimal user interface - Can get shouty at volume

The Helm Audio Bolt USB DAC/headphone amp is a device that we found to be both small and elegant in its simplicity when we tested it. Like most of the DACs in this guide, it's designed to make the sound coming out of your laptop or smartphone far better than it otherwise would be. The good news with this option from Helm is that it's priced to make its talents available to as many people as possible and our best mid-range choice.

The Bolt is in its element when it comes to high-resolution audio content. It can handle 32bit/384kHz, DSD256 and MQA stuff easily, generating enough power to drive most headphones we tested to workable level. It’s also genuinely portable, with a design that's small and light enough to slip in a pocket.

Overall, it delivers an enjoyable listen. Push up the volume to extremes and it can sound a little hard and two-dimensional, but otherwise we found it a pleasure to test. The levels of details are high here, frequency extension is impressive at either end of the range, and the soundstage it creates is convincing, not to mention fun.

If want want a DAC that doesn't just sound good, but looks great too, then meet iFi's hip flask-esque hip-dac 3.

It may look a little dull in the static photos from our review, but it comes in a shade called 'Titanium Shadow', because it was purported to ""change tone in different lights, with hints of bronze and vintage gold."" And, in real-life, it looks just as special as that description sounds. We think it'll pair fantastically well next to your shiny new iPhone 15.

Looks aside, how does it sound? Fantastic. In our iFi hip-dac 3 review we wrote: ""once you've heard it, you'll struggle to go back to listening without it for detail, neutrality and clarity."" We were right, this is one extremely enjoyable listen, delivering a classy and refined audio experience.

The best portable DAC for small pockets

6. iFi Go Blu The best portable DAC for small pockets Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 3.5mm, 4.4mm Bluetooth: Yes Dimensions: 54 x 34 x 13mm / 27g Sample rate: N/A Today's Best Deals View at World Wide Stereo View at Crutchfield View at BHPhoto Reasons to buy + Wired or wireless connectivity + Big, bold sound Reasons to avoid - We'll have to get back to you

Don’t let the picture fool you: the iFi Go Blu is actually minuscule. At 54 x 34 x 13mm and 26g, it’s small and light enough to forget all about and our top pick if you want a device small enough to slip into a pocket. Unless you’re paying attention to the music it’s serving you, of course, in which case it becomes impossible to ignore.

iFi products show up in this list time and time again, and with good reason. The company is an absolute master at taking digital audio information and converting it to analogue information, intact and in full. And even when it’s doing so in an enclosure barely larger than a DAC chipset, it finds room to separate Bluetooth connectivity, DAC and headphone amplification into separate, discrete blocks - and the sonic results are startling.

Attach your Go Blu to your smartphone wirelessly. Attach your favourite headphones. Play one of your favourite songs. And then revel in the wide-open nature of the iFi’s sound, its rock-solid soundstaging, its lavish detail retrieval and its outright punch.

The best portable DAC for desktops

7. Audioquest Dragonfly Red The best portable DAC for desktops Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Inputs: USB Type B Outputs: 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 12 x 19 x 72mm / 22g Sample rate: 24bit/96kHz PCM Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (Red) View at Crutchfield View at Newegg (Red) Reasons to buy + Very portable + No battery to charge Reasons to avoid - Lacks nuance - Little volume control

Audioquest basically invented the USB DAC with the original Dragonfly back in 2012, but until now the device's power demands limited it to desktop use, thanks to the iPhone's 100mAh limit on power draw through its lightning port.

But Dragonfly's latest devices completely change that. By using an all-new USB microcontroller, Audioquest's Dragonfly Red/Black's DACs now consume closer to 25mA, and can now be used happily with any iOS device - though you will need to shell out for an Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter.

This makes the Dragonfly a pretty compelling iPhone DAC. With a total size smaller than most USB sticks the Dragonfly fits easily into a pocket alongside an iPhone.

Dragonfly Red is the more premium offering. It contains a better DAC chip, and outputs 2.1 volts of power as opposed to the Black's 1.2 volts. That mean the Red is a better choice for driving high-impedance headphones.

With my headphones plugged directly into my iPhone I was comfortable listening to music with the volume set halfway, but with the Red I could listen at just a quarter and with the Black this was strangely reduced to just one volume bar.

In effect this means that you have a lot less control over the listenable volumes – turning the Black up just one volume notch meant that music was too loud, and turning it down one muted the iPhone completely.

Both versions, however, added a good amount of heft to the bass without sacrificing the clarity of mid frequencies. A play through of Daft Punk's Get Lucky didn't shimmer in the same way without the DAC than with it.

Whether you'll want to pay extra for the Red version depends entirely on how difficult your headphones are to drive – there's far more of a difference with power-hungry over-ears than budget in-ears.

Neither the Dragonfly Red or Black can match the sophistication of the Chord Mojo 2 at the top of this list, but their budget price and much more practical form-factor make for a far better portable listening experience.

The best portable DAC for USB-C devices

8. Astell & Kern AK USB-C Dual DAC The best portable DAC for USB-C devices Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 27g Sample rate: PCM 32-bit/384kHz, DSD256 Today's Best Deals View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Tidy dimensions for supreme portability + Vigorous, convincing sound Reasons to avoid - Seems like a lot of money for so little actual stuff

As one of the biggest names around where portable music players are concerned, Astell & Kern has already demonstrated just how profoundly it knows its way around a DAC. And for its first stand-alone, off-board DAC, the company has (in relative terms) knocked it out of the park.

The USB-C Dual DAC is basically two little blocks (a USB-C plug and a DAC) joined by a flexible, braided length of cable. Lined up against any of the other DACs here (even the EarMen Sparrow) it’s tiny, and it weighs around 25g. But A&K has found room for two DAC chipsets capable of handling audio files of up to 32bit / 385kHz resolution, as well as headphone amplification.

Make the connection between phone and headphones using the A&K, and stand by to be impressed. Your music gains attack and control, enjoys far greater detail levels... heck, it’s even across-the-board louder.

And while it’s not a wireless solution à la Audiolab, the USB-C configuration means you can even use it with those smartphones that are too fashionable to have a headphone socket. Well, not Apple of course, but then Apple always was determined to make things difficult.

9. EarMen Sparrow The best portable DAC for portability Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 3.5mm, 2.5mm balanced Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 42 x 8 x 22mm Sample rate: DSD, DXD, PCM (up to 384kHz), MQA (up to 384kHz) Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Small, light, and supremely portable + Great specifications Reasons to avoid - Big money for such a little object

At a trifling 8 x 22 x 42mm, the EarMen Sparrow is hardly a burden to carry about, making it our top pick for portability. But despite its negligible size, it’s full of the right stuff. It can handle most digital file types, from PCM and DSD to DXD and MQA, and it’s got both 3.5mm unbalanced and 2.5mm balanced headphone outputs. So good luck trying to find audio files or headphones it’s not compatible with.

And even though it’s hard to make a product of these dimensions seem like value for money, the glass-and-steel construction make it feel good too. Even the cables it’s supplied with look and feel quite expensively braided.

Best of all though, is the fact the difference the Sparrow can make to your smartphone-derived sound is out of all proportion to its, um, proportions. Detail levels, the definition of the soundstage, the extension and control of bass sounds... heck, even something as fundamental as volume gets a boost.

The EarMen Sparrow, then, is further proof – as if any were really needed – that it's not the size of your DAC that counts.

The best portable DAC if money is no object

10. iFi iDSD Diablo The best portable DAC if money is no object Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Inputs: USB A, S/PDIF digital and optical audio inputs Outputs: 6.3mm, 4.4mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 25 x 160 x 72mm Sample rate: PCM 32 bit / 768kHz, DSD512, and MQA (decoder) Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (Red) Reasons to buy + Supports all hi-res formats + Profoundly accomplished sound Reasons to avoid - Relatively large - Much pricier than similar rivals

Yes, we’re stretching the limits of the word ‘portable’ here, but because the 25 x 72 x 166mm iFi is a) battery-powered, b) weighs 330g and c) is supplied with a nice little carry-case for it, the iDSD Diablo qualifies for a place on this list. Which is just as well, because it’s one of the best-sounding DACs around – but you'll have to pay for that sort of premium.

No matter if you want to put an intense rocket up the sound of your smartphone, your laptop or an entire music or home theatre system, the iDSD Diablo is talented enough to make your hair stand on end. Its powers of analysis – the way it peers deep into a recording and returns with every scrap of information – are staggering, and it has the sort of dynamic headroom that can make the distance between ‘very quiet’ and ‘very loud’ very wide indeed. It’s controlled, it’s insightful, it’s tonally impeccable and, above all else, it’s musical. No recording is too dense, too complex or too tricky to wrong-foot it.

In fact, the iFi iDSD Diablo could well be all the DAC you’ll ever need. Which, when you have another glance at that price-tag, is probably just as well.

The best portable DAC for phones

11. EarMen TR-Amp The best portable DAC for phones Specifications Inputs: USB-C Outputs: 6.3mm, 3.5mm Bluetooth: No Dimensions: 129 x 66 x 30mm / 240g Sample rate: DSD 128 Native, DSD 256, PCM (up to 384kHz), MQA (up to 384kHz) Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Adaptable + Chunky, convincing sound Reasons to avoid - Bulky dimensions

Much like the Chord Mojo 2 at the top of our guide, the EarMen TR-Amp is a cuspy product. Its dimensions (30 x 66 x 129mm) and weight (240g) mean it’s far from big or heavy in and of itself, but there’s no denying it’s bigger and heavier than almost any smartphone. Which means you might think twice about whether it’s suitable for your ‘portable’ purposes. But then you hear what it can do, and all the digital audio file types it can do it with, and those considerations become quite a lot less compelling.

At one end of the boxy little frame, a couple of USB-C inputs deal with data and charging - and they can be used simultaneously (the battery’s good for around 10 hours of playback). There’s also a pair of RCA outputs, allowing for connection into a static system. At the other end there’s a big volume control, and 6.3mm and 2.5mm headphones outputs (which can also be used simultaneously).

And in between, the TR-Amp takes your digital audio information and spruces it up considerably. Where rhythmic expression, dynamic headroom and soundstage definition are concerned (just for starters), the EarMen outperforms your smartphone (and that’s any smartphone) comfortably, making it our top choice for use with phones. As long as you can accommodate it, the TR-Amp will do nothing but pamper you.

The best portable DAC for wireless

12. Audiolab M-DAC Nano The best portable DAC for wireless Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Inputs: N/A Outputs: 3.5mm Bluetooth: Yes Dimensions: 44 x 44 x 14mm / 28g Sample rate: 32-bit/384kHz Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Easy to use + Adds wireless capabilities to wired headphones Reasons to avoid - Battery life is so-so - Not as versatile as some options

Don’t be fooled by the tiddly dimensions, the M-DAC nano is a powerful, pocketable piece of audio excellence that we recommend if you're looking for an option to add wireless capabilities to wired headphones.

A portable headphone DAC and amplifier at a reasonable price, it’ll boost the audio performance of any device with Bluetooth connectivity. It’s about as simple as a gadget like this can be: just connect the Audiolab to your smartphone or MP3 player wirelessly, plug a pair of wired headphones in and away you go.

In effect, your headphones have a wireless connection to your phone, with a dedicated volume wheel on the M-DAC nano. An ‘F’ button on the unit enables 32bit/384kHz upscaling, bringing critical clarity and depth to your source’s sound.

You’ll get eight hours of playback under regular circumstances, and a still-respectable six hours with upsampling turned on too, and the Audiolab will drive headphones as demanding as 3000ohms with 7.5mw of power. It supports Bluetooth 4.2 (with aptX, aptX Low Latency and AAC codecs covered), which is more than enough to squeeze extra performance from a portable player.

The headphone jack is going the way of the dodo. The headphone amplification of smartphones is improving at a pace best described as ‘glacial’. So the M-DAC nano makes an awful lot of sense.

How to choose the best portable DAC for you

OK, we'll level with you. This isn’t the most glamorous tech purchase you'll ever make. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t demand for it and that you shouldn't buy one. Au contraire, if you care about the quality of your music, you should!

New DACs are released all the time – large devices, smaller ones, those that are mains-powered and others that are battery-powered. You can get DACS for iPhones, as well as models with wired or wireless connectivity, too. We've explained all below, because we want you to make the right purchase for you and one you'll love for years to come.

In this guide we’re focusing on the best of the most portable DACs around. If you give any one of these fine items a listen, then we guarantee your ears will thank you.

What do I need a portable DAC for?

If you're serious about sound and have the headphones or speakers to match, a portable DAC is a serious audio upgrade.

The DAC is the bit of your phone (or other audio device) that takes the bits and bytes of a digital audio file and turns it into audio for your headphones or speakers to play. In most smartphones, the DAC's sound quality is not the only criteria: there's size, and performance, and battery usage, and all kinds of other considerations. And that means while the sound quality from a device's own DAC is never less than acceptable, it isn't always brilliant. An external DAC improves your audio experience considerably.

Of course you could just get used to how your phone plays music. But if you're an audiophile (or even if you shy away from that term but you just love music) that just won't do. So, if your music isn't sounding quite as spectacular as it should – and the only thing you've changed recently is the source – it's likely that your new device (a new laptop, desktop, phone or tablet) has a poor quality DAC built-in.

The second reason to shell out for a better system is the fact that some of the more premium headphones on the market are 'high-impedance' headphones, which require more power through the headphone jack on your music source in order to work properly. (Impedance, for the record, is measured in a unit called ohms, and less than 50 ohms is considered to be low-impedance.)

As a rule, the harder a pair of headphones need to be driven, the better they will eventually sound when paired with the right equipment. An external DAC helps with these headphones as it can work as a headphone amp to provide the extra power needed to drive a high-impedance pair of 'phones.

Do DACs improve the sound quality of phones? Yes. Very much so. There's already a DAC in your phone, but chances are it hasn't been designed solely for great audio: it's usually part of a balancing act for things like battery life, how much space is available inside the device, cost and other considerations. So you'll often find that even high priced phones have DACs that are good rather than great. With an external DAC you're using hardware that's been designed with sound quality as the single most important feature. Flabby bass is tightened and tuned; abrasive treble is smoothed; mids punch more and the soundstage is more expansive. DACs usually support much higher bit rates than phone DACs do too, which is important if you're listening to hi-res audio.

Do DACs work with iPhones? It's worth bearing in mind that some portable DACs won't work with iPhones – you may find that when you plug them in, you get an error message that says ""the attached accessory uses too much power"". If that's the case, you'll need to purchase a Lightning-USB 3 adaptor, and plug it into an outlet while using the DAC to give it the power it needs. Alternatively, some DACs, like the Audioquest's Dragonfly Red, can be used with an iPhone without being plugged into an outlet - but you will still need an Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter.

Do DACs work with Android phones? As with iPhones, the answer is yes with a caveat: you'll need the right connector – many modern Android phones have USB-C but many DACs haven't moved to that connector yet, so you'll need to check what cables come with it – and you'll need sufficient power to drive it, something that's not always possible with some phones. For those you'll need an additional power source such as a powered USB hub.

"Not everyone in Hollywood is happy with the film industry's historic AI deal. A provision allowing for the creation of digital replicas and synthetic performers could, critics argue, decrease the number of jobs available to both performers and crew. This, in turn, could allow big-name stars—and their AI-generated clones—to feature in multiple projects at once, pushing out emerging actors as Hollywood becomes awash with synthetic performers.

Feelings are so strong that 14 percent of the national board of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA for short, actually voted against taking the deal to its general membership for ratification. Leaders of the Directors Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America, in contrast, overwhelmingly agreed to have their members accept the agreements they hammered out with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).

With their deal with AMPTP, writers were trying to wrest control of a tool that could learn to draft original scripts or alter human-written scripts without permission. For actors, one of the key issues in the negotiations was different—AI could, they worried, steal their very likeness. Tight controls seem existentially necessary. ""In this agreement, there are indeed a lot of imagined uses going forward, both for minor characters, for major characters, and background actors,” says Joshua Glick, visiting associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College. “That is part of why there’s maybe more anxiety surrounding where the actors stand with AI versus the gains made for the writers.”

One of the loudest critics of the deal has been Family Ties actress Justine Bateman, who serves as an AI adviser to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee. In the days after SAG reached its tentative deal with the AMPTP, she posted a widely shared thread on X that ended with, “Bottom line, we are in for a very unpleasant era for actors and crew.”

Bateman’s biggest worry is the language in the agreement concerning “synthetic performers”—or AIs that resemble humans. “This gives the studios/streamers a green-light to use human-looking AI objects instead of hiring a human actor,” she wrote on X. “It’s one thing to use [generative AI] to make a King Kong or a flying serpent (though this displaces many VFX/CGI artists), it is another thing to have an AI object play a human character instead of a real actor.” This, she argued, would be akin to Teamsters allowing their employer to use self-driving trucks instead of union drivers.

How you regulate the characteristics of these “synthetic performers” is another quandary. A summary of the new deal states that “if a producer plans to make a computer-generated character that has a main facial feature—like eyes, nose, mouth, or ears—that clearly looks like a real actor, and they use that actor’s name and face to prompt the AI system to do this, they must first get permission from that actor and agree on how this character will be used in the project.”

Actors can rely on the right of publicity, also known as likeness rights, to protect them if a studio clearly infringes on their image. But what about a synthetic performer that displays, say, the gravitas of Denzel Washington but is not, technically, Denzel Washington? Could that be claimed as a “digital replica,” which the contract states requires consent to use? How easily will an actor be able to defend more nebulous traits? With some legal weight, a studio might argue that its AI performer is simply trained on the performances of great actors, like any budding thespian, in much the same way a large language model “digests” great works of literature to influence the writing it churns out. (Whether or not LLMs should be allowed to do this is a matter of ongoing debate.)

“Where does that line lie between a digital replica and a derived look-alike that’s close, but not exactly a replica?” says David Gunkel, a professor in the Department of Communications at Northern Illinois University who focuses on AI in media and entertainment. “This is something that’s going to be litigated in the future, as we see lawsuits brought by various groups, as people start testing that boundary, because it’s not well defined within the terms of the contract.”",technology
"Palestinian firefighters worked to put out a fire in a building that was hit by an Israeli strike in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.

Israel unleashed a barrage of airstrikes across Gaza on Saturday, killing dozens of people and sending hundreds of wounded to overwhelmed hospitals, according to health authorities in the territory. The attacks came a day after the United States vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire.

Some of the strikes targeted the southern Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to go to avoid bombardment, underscoring the reality that there is no safe place in Gaza to take shelter.

Videos published by Reuters from the southern city of Khan Younis showed buildings engulfed in flames after an Israeli strike. Local media reports showed videos of rescuers and civilians digging people from rubble with their hands by the light of flashlights and cellphones. Other images showed patients being treated on bloody hospital floors.

On Wednesday, the U.N. secretary-general, António Guterres, had invoked a rarely used rule that allows him to bring to the Security Council’s attention matters that “may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security.” Mr. Guterres argued that a cease-fire was necessary because of the suffering of ordinary Palestinians in Gaza and the risk that the humanitarian catastrophe there could threaten world stability.

This led to the vote in the U.N. Security Council on Friday on the resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire which the United States vetoed, saying that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas. Israel launched its military assault on Gaza after Hamas, the armed group which controls the enclave, led an Oct. 7 attack on Israel in which some 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israel’s two-month aerial and ground assault on the besieged Gaza Strip has killed at least 15,000 people, and perhaps thousands more, according to the Gaza health ministry. Palestinian leaders and Arab nations say the Israeli military campaign is a profoundly disproportionate response to Oct. 7.

America’s veto of the cease-fire resolution stunned many Gazans who had hoped the airstrikes and their suffering would stop. The day before the Security Council vote on a cease-fire, the Biden administration, Israel’s closest ally, had begun to warn that the Israeli military had not done enough to prevent harm to civilians in Gaza.

“People were optimistic that the war might end,” said Muhammad al-Masri, a local journalist in the town of Rafah in southern Gaza. “The last few days, we thought that America was going to stop this and give Israel a deadline to end the war,” he added. “But it ended up being the opposite. It is the one that opposed the cease-fire.”

Mr. al-Masri is now living in a tent encampment where the winter rains have flooded what little shelter people have. On Saturday, he said, Israel “fired two rockets near the shelter where we are staying and many people were killed and injured,” he said.

The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comment on the reports that it had targeted Rafah after urging Gaza civilians to take shelter there.

Ahmed al-Qayed, a 31-year-old carpenter, said he had pinned his hopes on the U.N. finding a resolution to the conflict so he and family could return home to Gaza City in the north of the territory.

Along with thousands of other displaced people, Mr. al-Qayed said he, his wife and their children had been living in a ramshackle tent in Rafah, where the most basic necessities, like access to a bathroom, were often not available.

“Say to America we want to go back to our homes,” he said. “What’s our guilt? We are sick and tired.”

There is a shortage of everything in Gaza, he said, including food and blankets. Like hundreds of thousands of others, they have been relying on canned food — some of it expired — and hadn’t eaten any fruits or vegetables in many weeks. He said he does not have money to buy firewood and instead spends his days trying to collect branches and twigs to keep his family warm.

Abdullah al-Nems, a 41-year old taxi driver in Rafah, said he had stopped working in part because of the lack of fuel in Gaza and in part because he was too afraid to leave his home with the frequent Israeli airstrikes.

Even at home, he said, he and his family remain afraid of bombs and missiles, which have leveled entire neighborhoods and at times killed entire families in one strike, according to Gaza residents and authorities.

“My whole life is horror,” Mr. al-Nems said. “Why should my son and daughter remain terrified all day? Why should I keep being terrified while sitting at my house?”

The war has displaced about 85 percent of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians, with most sheltering in tent encampments, overcrowded schools and other public buildings. With the onset of winter, the situation has grown bleaker by the day, Gazans say.

U.N. officials say they are struggling to deliver essential goods like food, medicine and cooking gas to desperate civilians.

“People are talking about how the U.N. hasn’t even distributed anything that can be eaten to the people sheltering in the schools,” said Mohammed Aborjela, 27, a project coordinator with the development organization Youth Without Borders. “The United Nations can’t force Israel to do anything.”

Mr. Aborjela used to document daily life and culture in Gaza on his Instagram account before the war. Where once he uploaded videos of seaside cuisine in Gaza, now he posts about the daily struggle to find drinking water and food.

“People all had hope that the war will end within a few days,” he said. “And everyone is talking about whether it will end before the end of the year.”

"Of all the layoffs happening at Spotify this week, this has to be the biggest. Chief financial officer Paul Vogel, who since 2020 has managed the company’s balance sheet as it expanded into podcasting and audiobooks, is leaving the company at the end of March 2024.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the decision was made because Vogel didn’t have the experience needed to help the company both expand and meet market expectations. The company is starting the search for a successor.

“Spotify has embarked on an evolution over the last two years to bring our spending more in line with market expectations while also funding the significant growth opportunities we continue to identify. I’ve talked a lot with Paul about the need to balance these two objectives carefully. Over time, we’ve come to the conclusion that Spotify is entering a new phase and needs a CFO with a different mix of experiences. As a result, we’ve decided to part ways, but I am very appreciative of the steady hand Paul has provided in supporting the expansion of our business through a global pandemic and unprecedented economic uncertainty,” Ek said in a statement published Thursday evening. Vogel did not issue a statement.

After testing investors’ patience with acquisitions and investments, Spotify is focusing on producing a profit, for better or worse. Much of its original podcasting operation has shuttered, including the cancellation this week of its two most prestigious shows, Heavyweight and Stolen. Approximately 1,500 people this week were laid off from product, advertising, marketing, and content, amounting to 17 percent of its staff.

Vogel is a longtime Spotify employee, joining the company in 2016 as the head of FP&A, treasury, and investor relations before being promoted to CFO in 2020. Prior to that, he had been a managing director at Barclay’s and an SVP at AllianceBernstein.",technology
"German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also lashed out at Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić for cozying up to Russia | Pool photo by Sebastian Gollnow via Getty images

LJUBLJANA — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Tuesday urged Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to drop his vetoes on launching EU enlargement talks with Ukraine and approving fresh cash for Kyiv.

Baerbock also lashed out at Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić for cozying up to Russia and putting his political opposition at a disadvantage ahead of upcoming elections.

Baerbock reacted critically to the latest threat issued by Orbán on Monday. The Hungarian leader wrote to European Council President Charles Michel to urge him to remove talks on opening accession negotiations with Ukraine from the agenda of next week’s EU leaders’ summit.

“We have no time for games at this moment,” Baerbock said in Ljubljana. “If we are in a situation where peace in Europe is under attack, then we must do everything we can every day and every hour to protect our people, and even more so the people of Ukraine, in the best possible way.”

The EU had planned to approve the launch of enlargement talks and the disbursement of €50 billion in financial support for Ukraine during its December 14-15 summit. But those steps require unanimity among all 27 EU leaders, allowing Orbán to threaten a veto.

Diplomats disagree on whether the Hungarian leader is determined to derail support for Ukraine or whether he’s trying to blackmail Brussels, with the aim of unblocking more than €13 billion in EU funds for Hungary which have been held back over rule-of-law concerns.

Baerbock, however, vowed that the EU would “do everything we can to ensure that Ukraine takes the next step in the accession negotiations.”

Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon also criticized Orbán during the press conference: “I do not accept blackmail,” she said, adding that countries which made reform efforts to become an EU member “must not become victims of national politics.”

Turning to Serbia, Baerbock criticized Vučić for walking a fine line between aligning with the EU and Russia at the same time, while also stoking tensions with Kosovo.

“When we talk about enlargement, it’s crucial that you cannot sit on two chairs at the same time,” the German foreign minister said.

On Serbia’s upcoming parliamentary elections on December 17, she urged Belgrade to guarantee equal media access for all political candidates and ban the misuse of government resources in the election campaign.",political
"Increasing talk of artificial intelligence developing with potentially dangerous speed is hardly slowing things down. A year after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and triggered a new race to develop AI technology, Google today revealed an AI project intended to reestablish the search giant as the world leader in AI.

Gemini, a new type of AI model that can work with text, images, and video, could be the most important algorithm in Google’s history after PageRank, which vaulted the search engine into the public psyche and created a corporate giant.

An initial version of Gemini starts to roll out today inside Google’s chatbot Bard for the English language setting. It will be available in more than 170 countries and territories. Google says Gemini will be made available to developers through Google Cloud’s API from December 13. A more compact version of the model will from today power suggested messaging replies from the keyboard of Pixel 8 smartphones. Gemini will be introduced into other Google products including generative search, ads, and Chrome in “coming months,” the company says. The most powerful Gemini version of all will debut in 2024, pending “extensive trust and safety checks,” Google says.

“It's a big moment for us,” Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcement. “We're really excited by its performance, and we're also excited to see what people are going to do building on top of that.”

How to Use Google’s Gemini AI Right Now in Its Bard Chatbot You can try out Gemini, Google’s rival to ChatGPT, for free. It’s super easy to access right inside Bard.

Gemini is described by Google as “natively multimodal,” because it was trained on images, video, and audio rather than just text, as the large language models at the heart of the recent generative AI boom are. “It’s our largest and most capable model; it’s also our most general,” Eli Collins, vice president of product for Google DeepMind, said at a press briefing announcing Gemini.

Google says there are three versions of Gemini: Ultra, the largest and most capable; Nano, which is significantly smaller and more efficient; and Pro, of medium size and middling capabilities.

From today, Google’s Bard, a chatbot similar to ChatGPT, will be powered by Gemini Pro, a change the company says will make it capable of more advanced reasoning and planning. Today, a specialized version of Gemini Pro is being folded into a new version of AlphaCode, a “research product” generative tool for coding from Google DeepMind. The most powerful version of Gemini, Ultra, will be put inside Bard and made available through a cloud API in 2024.",technology

"Lethal Company has proved that you don't need fantastic graphics and a big budget to scare the living daylights out of people.

While the multiplayer horror game is still in early access, that doesn't mean that it has less to offer than some of the best horror games. With several planets, monsters, and scrap already in the game, there is a lot to love. However, modders seem to be going the extra mile to add even more fantastic features to the game.

One mod that has caught the eye of the community is Skinwalkers by RugbugRedfern. This mod makes a horrifying change to the monsters, giving them the power to mimic your friends' voices to lull you into a false sense of security and then lash out for a quick and gruesome kill.

While it's great news that Lethal Company is getting some more fantastic updates before its 1.0 release, it is terrifying to think of the monsters becoming even more powerful.

With 17 monsters already in the horror game, Lethal Company can, at times, seem almost impossible to complete. Some of the worst enemies you can come up against lie in wait within the dark corridors of the vaults. The Bracken is particularly dangerous as it is able to speed around the hallways, hiding from your gaze and waiting for just the right moment when your back is turned to snap your neck and drag you off.

However, even if Lethal Company can seem like a pain to try and complete, what matters most is the journey and not the destination when you're playing with friends. However, having a hideous monster cosplay as a close mate so that it can kill you in a dark corner may create some rifts and distrust in your relationships.

If you're a fan of impossibly scary situations, then make sure you check out the best survival games and the best indie horror games that are available to play right now.",technology
"Part of / The best entertainment of 2023

Note: this review was originally published in July to coincide with the film’s Japanese premiere. It has been updated and republished for the film’s wide release in North America on December 8th.

The year is 1997, and famed Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of Princess Mononoke, a film that set new records at the box office for Japanese animation and revolutionized the medium. The year is 2001, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of Spirited Away, saying he can no longer work on feature-length animated films. The year is 2013, and Miyazaki announced plans to retire following the release of The Wind Rises, saying that “If I said I wanted to [make another feature film], I would sound like an old man saying something foolish.”

The year is 2023, and Miyazaki is an old man saying something foolish by releasing a new film, titled How Do You Live in Japan and renamed The Boy and the Heron for the international market.

Related Hayao Miyazaki is very convincing

The point is, it’s hard to say with any certainty whether this will truly be the moment when Hayao Miyazaki steps away from feature animation for good. He’ll likely never step away from animation entirely, directing a new short for the Ghibli Museum during his last retirement, Boro the Caterpillar. (In June Studio Ghibli executive Junichi Nishioka said that Miyazaki was still working on new film ideas.) Until a few days before the Japanese premiere, it was also hard to say what this mysteriously titled final film would actually be about, following a bold PR strategy of, well, not doing any PR. Only a single poster for the film featuring a heron was released before its theatrical debut, without so much as press or preview screenings, trailers, screenshots, or even a synopsis.

The first piece of promotional art for the film. Image: Studio Ghibli

Riding the train in the early hours of Friday morning to be one of the first to catch this all-new Miyazaki-directed feature film, The Boy and the Heron appeared to exist only as some mythical entity rather than a real film. In the absence of any news and in light of the single image’s striking repetitiveness, Japanese fans even resorted to creating memes of the bird, riffing on the name and the mystery surrounding it. Honestly, a part of me wondered if the whole thing was some trick, a ruse soon to be exposed to the world at last.

Another part wondered: if this film actually was real, what story would prompt Miyazaki out of his latest retirement? And how would I even discuss a film like this when even saying it exists could technically class as a spoiler?

I have that answer now. To give the minimal necessary introduction, the film opens during the firebombing of Tokyo in World War II, a hazy memory of the moment that young boy Mahito witnessed the death of his mother as the hospital she was in burned to the ground. The experience is seared in his mind like the erupting flames he witnessed, never truly moving on from the pain of this sudden loss. When Mahito joins his father to move out of Tokyo shortly after the war to live with his new (and already pregnant) partner in a large traditional home full of peculiarities — like a mysterious heron and an old abandoned stone building in the woods nearby — he struggles to accept this new situation.

These opening moments feel unsettling and heavy, especially in flashbacks, only briefly relieved by the kindly gaggle of old ladies at the home or the famed heron. While it embraces the fantastical as it takes us to a whole new world in pursuit of a far-from-normal heron’s promise that Mahito can see his mother once more (while continuing to search for his new mother who recently went missing), the weight of this opening lingers.

In these moments, it’s a rich, dense fantasy in the vein we’ve come to expect, both in terms of the detail visible in every scene and its greater thematic purpose. You may come to Spirited Away for its eclectic and intricate spiritual bathhouse, but you stay for the human story and deeper undertones at its core.

Continuing this comparison, you could even say these musings on the complexity of the human condition are emphasized by the 82-year-old Miyazaki with this final film, creating something that feels more autobiographical and self-reflective than The Wind Rises. For all that film was technically a biopic, it felt as much a reflection of the man behind the production as it was the master aviator at its center. While fantastical and family-friendly elements litter The Boy and the Heron, filling it to the brim with whimsy that lightens its heavy moments and brings endless charm to its stunning animation, the frank nature in which it explores Miyazaki’s self-reflective musings on memory makes it as much a conversation with the man in the mirror as it is the audience.

The question the film’s Japanese title poses lingers throughout the experience. How do you live? On the shoulders of those who came before you. After decades of defining the animation industry in Japan, Miyazaki has accepted his fate. This is ultimately a story about the hows and whys that define our memory, a recognition that no existence can live without building upon the inventions, experiences, and memories of those who came before us. A recognition that to move forward means to move on and let go of the past while keeping their memories and lessons close for the next person to carry that torch.

The Boy and the Heron feels like a recognition by Miyazaki of his place as a relic in a modern animation industry that’s moved on without him. Studio Ghibli has firmly embedded itself within animation history and particularly Japanese culture, where movies like My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki’s Delivery Service feel like rights of passage for Japanese children even before we discuss the park or museum or the copious merchandising. People who don’t watch anime or look down on animation as some childish toy likely still know and love at least one Ghibli film. Totoro was a character in Toy Story 3!

Yet it’s also been 10 years since Miyazaki released his last film and nine years since Ghibli’s final feature, When Marnie Was There. For all the media at one point seemed determined to anoint the so-called “next Miyazaki,” only the spiritual successor made up of former veterans of Ghibli, Studio Ponoc, ever attempted to directly emulate the distinct visual and narrative playbook of the famed studio. Mary and the Witch’s Flower released to moderate success in 2017, but notably, the first trailer for the studio’s new project The Imaginary premiered before this screening with a visual and thematic approach that serves as a distinct departure.

The anime landscape today is defined by a different director: Makoto Shinkai. Films like Five Centimeters Per Second, Your Name, and Suzume, with their intense post-processing over highly realistic environments telling stories about love and distance through the imagery of fantasy and science fiction, are nonetheless impressive but are very distinct from the works of Ghibli in their own, more modern style. In recent years, with the success of Shinkai’s works, the comparisons have stopped. You can’t be the next Miyazaki when you’ve already eclipsed the man you’re being compared to.

When it’s not Shinkai or one of his many imitators, recognizable franchises reign stronger than ever. Anime has always relied on adaptations of other mediums, but the shift from historically lower gross for such films as mere fan service to the blockbusters of today showcases a stark difference. Last year, One Piece Film RED grossed almost 20 billion yen in Japan, making it one of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time and placing it above Howl’s Moving Castle and all but two of Miyazaki’s works. The First Slam Dunk has similarly been breaking records and topped the box office for eight consecutive weeks upon release. And let’s not forget the monster 2020 success of Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, whose 40 billion yen domestic gross demolished Spirited Away’s record of the highest-grossing film of all time in Japan.

The point is, we don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse. There’s no glee or joy in discussing Miyazaki’s fading stardom. Indeed, with The Boy and the Heron, Miyazaki has produced one of his best films to date, a mature metafictional tale in a friendlier facade about memory and moving on from the past while carrying their precious experiences on their shoulders.

Yet the industry has moved on. This film feels thematically and visually like a lost piece of mid-2000s Ghibli media resurfaced from a vault and thrown onto cinema screens. No less impressive, but a piece of the past carried on the shoulders of those who built it, tossed into the world more to remember what we lost than to build upon what we have today. You could argue there’s irony in making a film about letting go and moving forward when a director can’t follow through with his desire to walk away, but maybe that’s why this movie had to be made.

We don’t see films like this being made anymore, for better and for worse

Honestly, so moved and impressed I was by this movie, I’d love for him to betray its message and come back, just one more time. The creative well underneath Miyazaki remains full, and I’m sure he could create another 10 films and still have new ideas to explore. We’ve barely scratched the surface of his bottomless talent.

In the movie’s first act, Mahito finds an old copy of How Do You Live?, the children’s book that inspired the film’s Japanese title. The title page is signed by his mother with a message of how much he’s grown. He breaks down in tears. The adventure which follows proves that she was right, and the book stays with him throughout, another memory passed down for him to bear.

Just as Mahito needs to accept the loss of his mother, leaving that cinema on Friday morning felt like closing the book on an era of animation history we’ll never get back. The items passed on to Mahito by the characters in this fantasy world are ways to remember his adventure and reconnection to his mother, just as we can always rewatch these films. And remember we must, as it’s only by passing these memories down that they can live on long after the people behind them are gone.

Miyazaki has accepted his time has come and gone, and this is his plea to be remembered by the next generation. With this understanding, everything from the film’s complex yet thematically resonant story to particularly its non-existent promotional campaign made sense. Releasing a film without a single trailer, screenshot, or even synopsis feels like career suicide, a sure chance a film will fail. It’s a strategy that could only succeed at the hands of a studio and director who earned respect like these two. In turn, this campaign is a final plea from Miyazaki to the public who admire him and his work.

Memories only outlive us by sharing them with others, ensuring they won’t be forgotten with our passing. Similarly, if we want this era of animation to be remembered for generations to come, the onus is on us as an audience to champion its voice and share it with others. Ghibli and Miyazaki already have their place in history. If The Boy and the Heron is to join it, we have to want to pass it on, hold it close, and carry it with us.

And, after all that, move forward.",technology
"McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that oversees the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, had been cautiously optimistic for months that he could broker a deal to re-up a program that is credited with saving 25 million lives and long enjoyed bipartisan support.

But he has been unable to bridge the divide between his Republican colleagues who accuse the Biden administration of using PEPFAR to fund abortion providers overseas and House Democrats who refuse to reinstate Trump administration rules that prohibited foreign aid going to groups that provide or counsel on abortions. Discussions about a compromise that would extend the program for more than one year but less than five, with language stressing the existing ban on federal money directly paying for abortions, have collapsed.

Talks have also run aground in the Senate. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) — the top negotiator in the upper chamber — said he has no plans to introduce a reauthorization bill this year.

“We’re still negotiating,” he said in an interview. “We were ready to move a long time ago. But we were not able to secure the necessary support on the Republican side.”

Now, the best hope for re-upping the $7 billion annual program is a government spending process beset by delays and divisions and slated to drag into January and February with no guarantee of success. PEPFAR can hobble along without reauthorization unless there’s a prolonged government shutdown. But its backers say that without a long-term U.S. commitment, groups fighting HIV and AIDS around the world will struggle to hire staff and launch long-term projects.

Complicating any hope for compromise is the 2024 election.

Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), the leading opponent in the House, wants to fund the program for one year, with new anti-abortion restrictions, through the State Department’s spending bill. He told POLITICO that he sees the longer-term reauthorization plans floated by McCaul, Cardin and other members as attempts to tie the hands of a future conservative president, and called it an “absolute non-path” forward.

“I am not going to roll over nor are my colleagues in the House,” Smith said, adding that he considers a compromise on this issue “bogus” and “a complete capitulation.”

McCaul met with former President George W. Bush to discuss PEPFAR’s fate earlier this fall, and had been optimistic his colleagues would come around.

But he now admits that Smith and his allies “will not settle for anything less than Mexico City-plus” — a reference to the Trump-era restrictions that President Joe Biden repealed. Additionally, he said, “a lot of the Freedom Caucus guys would not want to give aid to Africa.”

Tom McClusky, the director of government affairs at Catholic Vote, said he and other anti-abortion advocates are working with Smith and other hardliners in Congress to oppose extending PEPFAR without restrictions, and said efforts to reach a compromise have ended in a “stalemate.”

“I’m trying to find a path forward and I just don’t see it,” he said. “When you have participants in the program and the Biden administration itself saying that the program is promoting what they describe as ‘reproductive freedom,’ I don’t see how we can sit back and accept that.”

Smith, McClusky and their allies insist there is no threat to PEPFAR, noting that funding has continued and that many other government programs have carried on for years without reauthorization.

But Democrats in Congress and supporters of the program argue that only a five-year renewal gives groups providing services on the ground the stability they need to hire staff and create long-term plans, while a short-term reauthorization or no reauthorization could convince other countries that the U.S. commitment to ending HIV and AIDS is waning.

“Failure would send the absolute wrong message to the rest of the world,” Rep. Ami Bera (D-Cal.) told a roundtable of lawmakers and advocates on Capitol Hill last week who had gathered to mark World AIDS Day. “We have to find the moral courage to do what’s right.”

At that same event, Dr. John Nkengasong, the U.S. global AIDS coordinator and leader of PEPFAR, said he’s been inundated with phone calls from officials in countries benefiting from the program worried about the prospect of it not being renewed.

“The gains we have made so far are fragile,” Nkengasong said. “But hope dies last. We continue to remain hopeful that we will get a clean, five-year reauthorization that will enable us to bring this fight to an end.”

In September, House Republicans approved a one-year funding patch for PEPFAR with new anti-abortion restrictions as part of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs funding bill for the 2024 fiscal year. Democrats’ opposition to those restrictions and other provisions backed by Republicans mean the bill is not expected to become law in its current form.

“We don’t want to litigate this issue on a yearly basis,” said Cardin, who plans to keep working toward a clean, five-year reauthorization in 2024. “If we’re going to be asking our international partners to make multi-year commitments, we need to make sure that we have a multi-year authorization.”

There is no sign that either Democrats or Smith and his allies are willing to bend, and the deadlock means a PEPFAR reauthorization bill could have a hard time riding on a larger spending package early next year — if one comes together at all.

Divisions between the parties and within the GOP — including disputes about abortion policy — have stalled several spending bills and brought the government to the verge of a shutdown twice in the last three months.

Congress passed two short-term funding patches that expire in January and February. That eliminated the possibility of the typical end-of-year omnibus bill that many on both sides of the PEPFAR fight saw as the best vehicle for its reauthorization and kicked the fight into an election year when compromise — particularly on a contentious issue like abortion — will be more challenging.

“It’s helpful that the [continuing resolution] doesn’t go until Christmas,” said McClusky of the efforts to prevent a clean reauthorization from moving forward. “It’s harder to block things when everybody wants to go home.”",political
"As negotiators from nearly 200 countries enter the final week of climate talks at COP28 in Dubai, all eyes will be on the big players and who moves first.

In this week’s special edition of Power Play from Dubai, host Anne McElvoy talks to one of the most influential figures in the talks — John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate. A close ally of President Joe Biden and veteran of climate negotiations over several decades, the former secretary of state has the ear of this year’s controversial host — COP President Sultan al-Jaber from the UAE.

Kerry also has a domestic audience in mind. He tells Power Play: “The subsidies are crazy and we have them still in the United States. President Biden has said we’ve got to get rid of these subsidies. But again … you have to legislate to do that and we’ve been pretty gridlocked in our country for a period of time.”

To reflect on the interview and look ahead to the finale of this year’s COP, Anne is joined by POLITICO climate and energy reporter Zack Colman.",political
"Tales of Kenzera: Zau looks like an incredible side-scrolling action game.

The trailer for the game, which was announced at The Game Awards, had an amazing art style and looked like a blast to play. It’s launching on April 23rd, 2024, and it’s coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Next year looks like a good year for side-scrolling action games.

"Angelina Tsuboi has taken our favorite SBC, the Raspberry Pi , to the skies with her latest project. Tsuboi works as a pilot and has cybersecurity experience, making this project a no-brainer. She created what she calls Fly Catcher —a Pi-powered system that can detect false aircraft using Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B).

Aircraft use ADS-B signals to relay their respective location information. Hackers can create false readings that suggest an aircraft is nearby using ADS-B. Fly Catcher works by monitoring the 1090MHz frequency and can determine whether or not a potential aircraft is genuine thanks to a neural network developed just for this project.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Angelina Tsuboi) (Image credit: Angelina Tsuboi) (Image credit: Angelina Tsuboi)

The main board behind this project is a Raspberry Pi. It uses a custom neural network developed in Python to analyze ADS-B signals. This algorithm was trained on accurate ADS-B data to recognize actual flight data and fed false aircraft readings using SDR, just like a real hacker could use in an attack.

Tsuboi uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ connected to a 1,090 MHz antenna. It uses FlightAware SDR and can read ADS-B signals in real-time. To put the unit to the test, Tsuboi took it on an hour-long flight over Los Angeles. You can see this flight on her YouTube channel, where she details the project's inner workings.

Tsuboi was kind enough to make the project open source and has shared the source code for anyone wanting to check it out. With the proper hardware, you must copy the Flight Catcher repository, which can be found on GitHub.

"Following two years of preproduction, game developer 10 Chambers finally announced its new heist game—Den of Wolves—Thursday during the 2023 Game Awards. Set in 2097 in a highly corrupt city located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is, according to narrative director Simon Viklund, the kind of game “where you're supposed to feel like a badass.” For Viklund, who also serves as the game’s composer (he did the compositions for PayDay: The Heist and PayDay 2, too), that means “the music needs to, like, [grunt noise].”

True to its name, Den of Wolves’ fictional city is a place where basically anything is legal as long as it is done in the pursuit of supercharged innovation and groundbreaking technology. Imagine PayDay meets Cyberpunk 2077 set in a metropolis that's a mixture of Venice and Hong Kong. The concept is quite different from 10 Chambers’ previous work with horror game GTFO, but it structurally plays to the studio’s core strength: four person co-op games.

A lot is on the line as the studio works on its second release. 10 Chambers received an investment from Chinese tech and entertainment conglomerate Tencent to build this game and expand from a small staff of around 10 people to nearly 100. Viklund emphasizes that the game will have a highly detailed environment but that gamers should not expect an open-world experience. The overall vibe, Viklund adds, pulls from a litany of sci-fi and thriller movies, like Heat and Judge Dredd (the Stallone one, not the 2012 reboot).

While he enjoyed working on horror game music for GTFO, Viklund is excited to move away from that genre and back to a PayDay-esque heist experience. “My wheelhouse is this power fantasy type of music,” he says. Never played that franchise before? Give “Razormind” from PayDay 2 a listen any morning you forget your coffee at home and need a quick jolt of adrenaline.

So, what can players expect from the music in Den of Wolves? “So, there’s going to be elements, of course, that are similar to PayDay,” says Viklund. “But I’m keen on taking it somewhere else in terms of tempo. Making it heavier, slower paced.” He also looks forward to incorporating different elements of percussion inspired by the Pacific Ocean setting.

Since the game is still in early development and won’t be released for a while, WIRED did not see any actual game footage during a recent preview event 10 Chambers held for the title. Similar to the launch of GTFO, the company plans to release the game at first to players through Steam early access. Den of Wolves doesn't have a release date yet, but PC gamers can anticipate receiving it before their console counterparts.

Fans of GTFO may be disappointed that their game’s content updates are ending, but Viklund points to 10 Chambers’ first game as critical for building the company’s confidence around design. “It was very freeing to be able to have a project where we could have that ‘fuck it—we’ll just do it’ sort of attitude,” he says. This type of confidence is a driving force behind 10 Chambers’ decision to develop something fresh for players rather than relying on a franchise concept that already exists.",technology

My name is Mark Montero.

I'm the founder of LCG Auctions.

We specialize in high-end pop culture collectibles.

Today we're gonna talk through five collectibles

ranging from $3,000 to $60,000.

[bright music]

[dynamic music]

This is the very first Super Mario Brothers

released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

This particular example would appraise for around $10,000.

This is a rare hang tab edition.

The back of it has a hang tab that's perforated,

which is different from the subsequent models that came out.

And collectors find the hang tab very collectible.

This one is graded by CGC,

which is also a comic book grader.

They've graded some of the most valuable comic books.

Anything 9.0 or greater is considered exceptional condition.

Super Mario Brothers is the most popular

video game of all time.

There's been over 40 million copies sold.

Super Mario Brothers revived the video game industry.

After Atari, the video game console was starting to fail.

When the Nintendo Entertainment System came out,

Mario in particular,

it created a whole new level of interest.

The Holy Grail of Super Mario

is a 9.8 sealed hang tab edition.

It sold for $2 million.

[bright music]

This is a Sega Game Gear, released in 1991.

It's the very first release.

retailed at $149.99 at launch.

This is around $12,500.

This example is what we call Hobby Fresh.

It's never gone to market before,

and it'll be interesting to see where it ends up.

This grade is the Holy Grail of Sega Game Gears.

It's graded by VGA.

It's a VGA 85.

Game Gear was Sega's answer to Nintendo's Game Boy.

The Game Boy was black and white.

The Sega Game Gear was in color.

Unlike Game Boy, you could actually play

Game Gear in the dark because of the backlit screen.

The Sega Game Gear had popular titles

like Sonic The Hedgehog and Streets of Rage.

Over 10.5 million units were sold of the Sega Game Gear.

It was one of the most popular

portable gaming systems for years.

The Sega Game Gear is known for ripping through batteries.

But there was also a TV tuner that you could put on the top,

allowed you to watch television stations

on the portable console.

[dynamic music]

This is the very first release

of Ghostbusters on VHS, from 1985.

It retailed for $79.99.

79.99 was a very high price,

but VHS was in its infancy,

and the tapes were just very high.

It's dropped down a bit, but it's still in the four figures.

The first edition Ghostbusters has some unique features.

The logo on the front is an embossed logo.

On the back, it also has what we call waterfall watermarks.

These are vertical RCA white watermarks

that resemble a waterfall.

VHS as a collectible is relatively new

in the four and five figure numbers.

Some videotapes that have sold for a lot of money include

Superman Black Box Edition.

This was a Betamax tape that sold for $40,000.

And some of the early release Rocky's

have sold for significant amounts of money as well.

[dynamic music]

This is an Apple iPod first release,

first generation, from October, 2001.

It retailed for $399.

The last one that sold, sold for $29,000.

The first edition iPod is extremely rare

in factory sealed condition.

It's become highly collectible through the years.

In collectibles, we have something called scarcity.

Just because something is rare doesn't make it collectible.

Scarce factors in demand,

so something scarce is oftentimes collectible.

This is most definitely the Holy Grail iPod.

The first release, the five gigabyte version,

and factory sealed.

It has a black and white screen.

It utilizes buttons as opposed to a click wheel.

And it stores around 1,000 songs.

Apple had been struggling up until the early 2000s,

and this was the first handheld device

that really helped the company turn a corner.

And it really launched Apple's

handheld division to hew heights.

[upbeat music]

This is a first release iPhone from 2007.

This model cost $599.

We have it between 50,000 and $60,000.

This model's eight gigabytes.

For the internet it used something called the Edge Network.

It was a very slow internet service.

And that was kind of the main difference

for this first model compared to the subsequent models.

Factory sealed means the seal has not been broken,

it's not been opened up.

You may have an iPhone at your house

and think it could be worth a lot of money.

The reality is it's probably not.

There's a lot of them in the population.

And for that reason, they're not worth very much.

Steve Jobs introduced the phone

at Macworld in January, 2007.

There was a lot of hype around it.

The most expensive item that we have sold

is a first release iPhone from 2007.

It was the rare four gigabyte model.

The four gigabyte was discontinued after just two months in,

and it went for $190,000.

An item that would just be a Holy Grail

that we have not seen,

if we were to have an unopened iPhone

with a signature from Steve Jobs.

The sky would be the limit on something like that.

I've heard that he actually gave

a signed edition iPad to his inner circle.

There are counterfeits that enter the market

from time to time.

Collectors have to be very careful to make sure

that all sides of the iPhone are shown.

The seal follows a very detailed pattern.

The use of the box underneath the seal,

it should be in mint condition.

The seams along the side are very thin.

Those that are resealed,

the counterfeiters never tend to get the seal right.

[upbeat music]

My advice to those looking to get into collectibles

is to collect what you like.

Do your homework in terms of pricing,

previous sales history.

Some of the stuff is very, very expensive,

so you want a good amount of knowledge before you dive in.",technology
"A federal tax credit funded through the Inflation Reduction Act can currently shave up to $7,500 off the price of Tesla’s Model 3, but that’s about to drop in half. The tax credit will fall to $3,750 by January 1st, 2024 for the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range, the company warned.

Elon Musk’s company made the announcement via a banner on Tesla’s website, TechCrunch reports. Starting at around $36,000, the Model 3 comes with the lowest cost of any Tesla vehicle. Now, Tesla says the full tax credit will only be available to deliveries made through December.

Why? It looks like Tesla will be unable to meet sourcing requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). That might also affect tax credits for the Model Y and Model X next year.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit can save customers up to $7,500 on a new electric vehicle. But before that kicks in, carmakers need to meet a bunch of requirements around where the vehicle and its battery were made and how it sourced materials. The Department of the Treasury proposed new guidance for tax credits within the IRA last week.

Starting next year, “an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any battery components that are manufactured or assembled by a [foreign entity of concern] FEOC,” the new guidance says. The Department of Energy says FEOCs include entities “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of” governments including China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.",technology
"YouTube in July announced the US price increase for Premium, but grandfathered accounts got to keep the old rate for a few more months. According to an email today, that’s now set to change in January.

The price of an individual YouTube Premium subscription went up by $2 to $13.99 per month for current and new customers in July.

However, those that were grandfathered by Google Play Music and/or YouTube Red got “at least three extra months at [their] current price before the price increase will impact” them. At the time, YouTube said the price would not increase before December to show its appreciation of loyal members.

That period is now coming to an end, and $9.99 – or even $7.99 – grandfathered users will now pay $13.99/month for YouTube Premium starting in January.

We don’t make these decisions lightly, but this update will allow us to continue to improve Premium and support the creators and artists you watch on YouTube.

YouTube announced the latest Premium features in mid-November, and told customers to expect “new features and exclusive benefits that help you dive deeper into the content you love” in the future.

Those that want to cancel can manage their subscription here, while YouTube is also now rolling out this price hike internationally.

On a possibly related note, it appears that some grandfathered YouTube Premium members that use YouTube Music are seeing an “Upgrade” tab in the bottom bar. That’s typically reserved for free users or those on free trials, but a bug is causing the promo to appear for paying customers.

"Williams’ remarkable decision to go public about the feud is a bet that his political future will be improved by laying out its highly personal details. He spoke with POLITICO days after a Syracuse University student journalist shared a video of him in a profanity-laced confrontation with Gordon outside a holiday party in Washington.

Gordon was “trying to exert some leverage over me,” Williams said, “and I just simply won’t allow that to happen.”

Williams, a first-term member in a battleground seat, won his race year by one percentage point. He is one of House Democrats’ top targets to unseat in 2024.

Gordon said that “the allegations Congressman Williams has levied against me are categorically false” and declined to comment further. Sweeney said the “congressman’s allegations are completely false.”

The confrontation with Gordon, which Sweeney filmed, began causing political trouble for Williams soon after its release last week. On the day before indicted former Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress for a litany of alleged criminal misdeeds — a move that Williams and other New York Republicans led the charge for — Santos called for a House Ethics Committee investigation of Williams because of his behavior in the video.

Williams is seen confronting Gordon outside the party, pointing his finger at Gordon and vowing that if “you f–k with my family, I’ll end every relationship you have.” In response to that on-camera threat, Gordon denied any knowledge of the unspecified allegations at issue.

Williams said that the clash stemmed from a pressure campaign that began after his decision to give Gordon 30 days to find new employment. The ousted aide responded by contacting a GOP campaign consultant close to the lawmaker.

That consultant, Aaron Evans, told POLITICO he went to Williams in recent weeks to relay Gordon’s warning: Before going through with the firing, Gordon said, the lawmaker should think about the potential embarrassment his family would experience if TMZ found out about his daughter’s OnlyFans account.

POLITICO is not publishing the name of Williams’ daughter to protect her privacy.

Williams said in the interview that, a few days prior to that altercation, other aides of his told him that Gordon had shared details of the OnlyFans account widely with other congressional staffers. Gordon was also “saying really rude things about [Williams’] wife,” the lawmaker recalled.

Gordon lived in Williams’ home during part of the latter’s campaign, the lawmaker recalled. But their relationship began unraveling over the course of their months living together and as they worked more closely together in D.C., according to Williams, who described his former chief of staff as “a deeply broken person.”

Williams declined to comment on the specifics behind the dismissals of Gordon and Sweeney. A person with direct knowledge of the personnel matter, granted anonymity to discuss internal office dynamics, said that Sweeney was fired for reasons related to job performance.

After Sweeney recorded the lawmaker during their argument outside the holiday party, Williams said the former aide delivered a personal jab at the lawmaker: “Hey, f–k you! Guess what, bitch? All I have to do is pay $7 to watch your daughter shove her phone up her p—y!”

One eyewitness of the skirmish, however, could not confirm that version of events and recalled seeing Williams leave the area right after knocking Sweeney’s phone out of his hands. This eyewitness, granted anonymity to share recollections of the tense moment, added that the scene was loud and crowded so a comment might have been missed.

Williams’ critics have noted that he has faced multiple staff departures beyond Gordon and Sweeney since taking office. According to the nonpartisan website Legistorm found that he has had three times more turnover than the average House member.

Williams argued that he reshaped his office culture after settling into Congress, removing hires that Gordon had initially made, and said he’s now surrounded by a team he is proud of.",political

Invincible

When Mark Grayson inherits the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man, he sets out to follow in his footsteps as the new costumed superhero Invincible. Things do not go according to plan. After a shocking twist left the first season on a major cliff-hanger—save for the rather brilliant Invincible: Atom Eve one-shot plugging the gap and revealing the origins of a key character—this long-awaited return finds Mark's world upended. Now, he's trying to escape his father's shadow rather than live up to his legacy. Luckily, he's not on his own, as a new generation of heroes rises to help guard the globe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible offers a more mature take on superheroes that allows it to do something Marvel's and DC's characters rarely do: grow up.

The Wheel of Time

Based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this is one of Amazon’s most ambitious, and expensive, series to date. The eight-episode first season follows Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a powerful weaver of an ancient form of magic, as she gathers five unassuming young people, one of whom is destined to either save the world or destroy it. The recently released second season ups the stakes, with ancient evils returning and new terrors rising—just as the only ones who can stop them are scattered around the world. A visually stunning series that blends sumptuous location shoots with cinematic effects, this is an epic fantasy that's improving with every episode.

The Greatest Show Never Made

Back in 2002, it seemed everyone wanted to achieve the kind of celebrity that only comes from a breakout role on a reality TV show. It was the kind of social obsession that was all too easy for unscrupulous producers to abuse, as a host of young British fame-seekers found out when they threw their lives away for a show that was seemingly never real. Jobs were quit, homes were abandoned, and relationships were severed as they chased a huge cash prize. Decades later, this three-part documentary follows the people who were drawn into the web of ""producer"" Nikita Russian (an obvious pseudonym that should have been their first clue something was off) to explore what went wrong. Created with a mix of archive footage and bizarrely shot recreations, there's an air of unreality to the whole affair, proving once more that nothing is as strange as ""reality"" TV.

Gen V

Spinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with the twisted parent show though, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, and more The Hunger Games, with Superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions, before uncovering dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for, add in some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, and allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.

Jack Ryan

There's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The recently released final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet: investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.

I'm a Virgo

A surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode.

Carnival Row

There’s an element of “what might have been” about Carnival Row. Its strong first season showed huge potential, framing deeper themes of class, immigration, and race within a fantasy world where dominant humans and refugee fae live in uneasy lockstep. Sadly, the Covid-19 pandemic massively delayed its second—and ultimately final—season. But there’s still a neat package of 18 beautifully produced episodes to enjoy for a relatively concise binge. The first season introduces human police inspector Rycroft “Philo” Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) and his former lover, fae Vignette “Vini” Stonemoss (Cara Delevingne), as a string of murders rocks the gaslit city of The Burgue. In the second, tensions erupt as the oppressed fae make a stand for their freedom—putting Philo and Vini on opposing sides. With its quasi-Victoriana aesthetic and a preference for ornate character makeup and prosthetics, Carnival Row is also one of the most distinctive-looking series in recent years—just make sure your TV can handle deep, dark contrast levels, as it’s also one of the most literally dark shows.

The Power

You know how it is with teenagers. They feel a tingle, then suddenly sparks are flying—but this isn’t about first loves or misdirected crushes, but a rather more literal electricity, as young women around the world awaken to the power to generate and discharge lightning. Soon, it proves to be a gender-wide ability, with women old and young gaining The Power, a shift that soon changes social dynamics and power structures on a global scale. With a powerhouse cast fronted by Toni Collette as Seattle mayor Margot Cleary-Lopez, and Ted Lasso’s Toheeb Jimoh as Tunde Ojo, a photojournalist documenting the situation as it unfolds, The Power explores the seismic shift of such a change playing out everywhere from the US to Nigeria.

Daisy Jones & the Six

Spanning a decade, Daisy Jones & the Six follows the formation, stratospheric success, and crushing breakup of the greatest band the 1970s never saw. In the late ’60s, talented but listless ingenue Daisy (Riley Keough) meets aspiring rocker Billy Dunne (Sam Claflin) and his group, eventually joining the band herself. Soon, her soulful vocals and insightful songwriting help propel The Six to the top of the charts—but at the height of their careers, everything comes tumbling down, undone by years of wandering hearts, illicit sex, battles with sobriety, and the rigors of rock ‘n’ roll. If it all sounds a bit Fleetwood Mac, that should come as no surprise—the author of the book the series is based on, Taylor Jenkins Reid, has said the legendary folk-rock band was an inspiration. Yet with its fantastic cast, period-perfect tone, and phenomenal soundtrack—released as the album Aurora by the series’ eponymous band—Daisy Jones & the Six takes on a life of its own.

The Legend of Vox Machina

Bawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina began life as the hit Critical Role, in which a group of the biggest English-language voice actors in animation and gaming livestreamed their Dungeons & Dragons sessions before it evolved into its own beast. In the first season of this exquisitely animated fantasy, the show follows the eponymous Vox Machina guild—a motley crew of usually drunk adventurers consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they battle to reclaim the city of Whitestone from the monstrous Lord and Lady Briarwood. The recently added second season ups the ante with “the worst team ever assembled” fighting four apocalyptically powerful dragons. Fully accessible to long-time fans of the source material and newcomers alike, this series manages to be a love letter to D&D while poking plenty of fun at the classic RPG and transcending its origins to become one of the most original adult animated shows on Amazon.

The Rig

Supernatural thriller The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to ecological metaphors. In fact, they’re often downright clumsy, as when one character says “if you keep punching holes in the earth, eventually the earth’s going to punch back.” But if you can look past such clunkiness, this is an engaging piece of television. When the crew of the isolated Kinloch Bravo oil rig is cut off from civilization by a strange fog, the inexplicable deaths and equipment failures soon make it clear that this is no mere weather pattern. And as the tension and fear mount, being trapped in a glorified tin can in the North Sea drives the survivors to paranoid extremes. It’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic setting and the terrifying expanse of ocean around it, and the material is elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, making The Rig more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.

Tales From the Loop

Despite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.

The Devil’s Hour

When Peter Capaldi, here playing mysterious criminal Gideon Shepherd, says “my perception of time is better than anyone’s,” it’s clear that The Devil’s Hour creator Tom Moran is having a little fourth-wall-breaking fun with his former Time Lord leading man. That’s about as close as this gritty six-part drama gets to Doctor Who, though. Instead, this is a mix of murder mystery and thriller, topped off with a dash of the supernatural. The focus is on Lucy (Jessica Raine), an over-burdened social worker with an increasingly distant and troubled young son. Lucy wakes at exactly 3:33 am every morning, plagued by horrific visions, and her nightmares draw her into the orbit of police detective Ravi Dhillon’s (Nikesh Patel) investigations of a bloody murder and a child’s abduction. As she tries to figure out how the two are entangled, Lucy comes face to face with Shepherd. Raine is a phenomenally commanding lead throughout, while Capaldi's sinister performance is one of the most chilling you’ll see on screen.

Them

This horror anthology series, created by Little Marvin and executive-produced by Queen & Slim’s Lena Waithe, sets its first season in 1950s Los Angeles and follows the Emory family as they move into an all-white neighborhood. It all goes about as well as you might expect, with Livia (Deborah Ayorinde) soon penned into their new home by the Stepford-like housewives of the area who make her life a living hell, led by ringleader Betty (Alison Pill). Outside the home, husband Henry (Ashley Thomas) faces physical assaults and harassment at work. Ayorinde and Thomas are phenomenal throughout, brilliantly portraying the mental, physical, and emotional turmoil of living under relentless threat. While the show’s portrayal of the period is tense and horrifying in its own right, the layering of some truly unsettling supernatural threats make this a frequently terrifying watch.

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Tapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. Much of the focus is on Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) as she searches for Sauron, servant of Morgoth, but this ambitious fantasy series explores a range of events and themes, such as the fall of the island of Númenor; the fractious politics between man, elves, and dwarves; and the forging of those perilous rings. While there’s been no shortage of debate around Rings of Power, there’s also no denying that Amazon got what it paid for with the most expensive TV show ever made—this is one of the most beautiful series you’ll ever lay eyes on. Whether the ongoing story nails the landing remains to be seen, but for sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s nothing better at the moment.

The Boys

Superheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher and his “associates,” gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. In the newly dropped third season, the team is forced to go legit and work for the US government while struggling to topple the sadistic, psychotic Homelander, leader of The Seven—the world’s premier superheroes, brought to you by Vought International. To complicate matters, Butcher is wrestling with becoming the thing he hates most: a Supe. Possibly Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.

The Underground Railroad

Based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.

Fleabag

You’re not supposed to like Fleabag. She’s selfish, self-destructive, and morally bankrupt. Her family is loathsome, her lifestyle is ridiculous, and her job is a joke. Yet after watching this 12-episode series, we defy you not to love her a little. This magnificent sitcom about a Londoner (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) grappling with the death of her best friend has no filter: You’ll hear her thoughts on feminism, familial tension, love, and sodomy. The first time Waller-Bridge interrupts her own dialog to shoot a disarming, conspiratorial glance to the screen, you’re hooked. Season one is a smutty yet wonderful crescendo of self-destruction driven by a cast of characters that includes Fleabag’s intensely awkward sister Claire (Sian Clifford), her selfish and pretentious stepmother (Olivia Colman), and her clueless father (Bill Paterson). The second season cheerfully bounds into blasphemy as she grapples with inappropriate (and reciprocated) feelings for a Catholic priest (Andrew Scott). It’s shocking and immensely watchable—and one of the rare cases when a series truly is as good as people say.

The Man in the High Castle

This adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel

What is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon’s sharpest comedies.

The Expanse

Humanity now lives among the stars—well, the rest of the solar system, at least. A group of antiheroes are linked by the disappearance of a wealthy political activist, and between them they must unravel what happened to her. Adding to the complexity are the political tensions between Earth, Mars, and the Belt, a group of loosely affiliated colonies between the two planets. That’s just season one—there are six available on Prime, and each is packed with enough daring missions, space fights, and Martian politics to keep fans of hard science fiction hooked.

Good Omens

Feeling battered and emotionally bruised by bleak TV dystopias and even bleaker world news? Good Omens is your shelter in the storm, and inside it’s cozy, camp, and kind. Neil Gaiman has adapted his own 1990 book, cowritten with Terry Pratchett, which follows an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) as they try to stop Armageddon. The six-part event series gives fans exactly what they dreamed of from such a team. Silly stuff with Cold War overtones, extreme whimsy, and gruff British wit.

Good Omens 2

Four years is a long wait between seasons, but the dynamic between angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) and demon Crowley (David Tennant) in 2019’s original Good Omens (also on this list) was so perfectly charming that barely a day has gone by without fans clamoring for more. Thankfully, the hotly anticipated second season doesn’t disappoint, with the dastardly divine odd couple weaving their magic once again as they attempt to stave off yet another apocalypse. When the archangel Gabriel (Jon Hamm) goes missing from Heaven, only to show up amnesiac (and naked) at Aziraphale’s homely bookshop in London, it kicks off a battle between “upstairs” and “downstairs.” But while Gabriel’s half-remembered warnings of something terrible looming frame the season, it’s the exploration of the central duo’s past that really delights. With plenty of flashbacks showing more of Aziraphale and Crowley’s history—and more than a bit of fanservice playing to the nature of their millennia-long relationship—Sheen and Tennant’s chemistry gets to shine so bright it dazzles. An overdue but incredibly welcome return.

Forever

You’ll know within the first episode whether you’re into this slow, a stylized miniseries from Parks & Recreation and Master of None alums Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard. It’s part high-concept TV and part uncomfortable marriage drama, with a side helping of shtick from the two outrageously talented leads, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen. It might make you impatient at times, but Forever will stick with you if you hang on until the finale.

Sneaky Pete

Just released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious debtor played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete’s motley crew of estranged family, who are delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative–and enters waters just as shark-infested as those from which he’s come. Over the course of three seasons, Sneaky Pete proves itself one of the finest dramas Amazon has produced yet.

Mozart in the Jungle

A comedy-drama documenting the world of professional orchestra musicians in New York, Mozart in the Jungle is a strange beast. The series follows Hailey Rutledge (Lola Kirke), an aspiring oboist trying to build a career with the New York Symphony, and her conflicted relationship with eccentric conductor Rodrigo De Souza (Gael García Bernal). With a strong creative team and real-world source material in the form of professional oboist Blair Tindall’s memoir Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music, the compelling and frequently hilarious show has picked up Golden Globes and Emmy Awards and proven itself one of Amazon’s best exclusives.

Red Oaks

In the mid-’80s, college student and struggling filmmaker David Myers (Craig Roberts) wants one last, great summer before facing adulthood. Unfortunately, he’s stuck working at a pretentious country club and struggling to gain momentum in his life. Big dreams of making it in the film industry meet crushing reality as David navigates the demands of the club’s eccentric guests—from taking awkward wedding shoots to filming sex tapes for swingers clubs—while also struggling to maintain his relationship with girlfriend Skye. All three seasons of this delightful period comedy are available now.

Vikings

Inspired by the real-life Viking hero and ruler Ragnar Lodbrok, Vikings is a family saga exploring the lives, epic adventures, and cultural politics of the raiders and explorers of the Dark Ages. Six seasons of the historically inspired action series are available on Amazon Prime Video, with WWE wrestler Adam “Edge” Copeland joining the cast in season five as the story expands to a civil war in Norway, battles in England against the Nordic invaders, and exploration of northern Africa.

Lore

Entertaining well past Halloween, this anthology series presents “the frightening and often disturbing tales based on real people and events that have led to our modern-day myths and legends.” Based on the award-winning podcast of the same name, it offers two six-episode seasons of real-world horror stories guaranteed to chill your bones.",technology
"As a part-time commentator on things economic, I’m often asked a seemingly straightforward question: If the economy is so good, why are Americans so grumpy?

By many measures — unemployment, inflation, the stock market — the economy is strong. Yet only 23 percent of Americans believe the country is headed in the right direction, a strong headwind for President Biden’s approval ratings. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s formidable base of disgruntled voters endures.

As I’ve engaged with my many interlocutors, I’ve concluded that voters have valid reasons for their negativity. In my view, blame two culprits: one immediate and impacting everybody, and another that particularly affects young people and is coming into view like a giant iceberg. Both sit atop the leaderboard of reasons for the sour national mood.

While inflation has provided the proximate trigger for unhappy feelings, an understandable grimness about our broader economic prospects, particularly for younger Americans, is playing a major part.",political
"""We cannot take the decision to start a process of accession negotiations,” Viktor Orbán said | Max Slovencik/EFE via EPA

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán stood firm in his staunch opposition to Ukraine being admitted to the EU, calling it “corrupt” a week before EU leaders are set to make a decision on starting talks with Kyiv on joining the bloc.

“Hungary is a neighbour of Ukraine … we know exactly what is happening,” Orbán told French news outlet Le Point in an interview published Friday. “Ukraine is known to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. It’s a joke!” he said.

“We cannot take the decision to start a process of accession negotiations,” Orbán said.

EU leaders are set to gather in Brussels next week for two historic decisions on Ukraine: approving a plan to begin discussions on Kyiv joining the 27-nation bloc and the release of €50 billion in aid for Ukraine.

Yet Orbán’s shadow looms over the summit, as the Hungarian leader has adamantly opposed the opening of accession negotiations for Ukraine — despite the European Commission giving the green light in November — and threatened to use Hungary’s veto power to block the disbursement of the aid funds.

In what Le Point said was Orbán’s first interview in France since 2015, the Hungarian leader stood by his stance, calling the EU’s plan to start accession talks a “bad decision.” Ukraine is not ready to join the EU, Orbán said, despite the Commission’s declaration.

One of Orbán’s main concerns remains Ukraine’s “corruption,” despite Hungary’s own fragile reputation when it comes to transparency. The EU has repeatedly raised concerns of corruption and rule-of-law breaches in Hungary, warning of democratic backsliding during Orbán’s decade-plus in power in Budapest.

A Transparency International report earlier this year found that Hungary was seen as the most corrupt country in the EU. Ukraine scored nine points worse than Hungary on Transparency International’s scale of perceived public sector corruption.

Orbán also said the EU needs to do a lot more “preparatory work” before the bloc will be ready to welcome Ukraine.

“If you allow this [Ukrainian] agriculture to enter the European agricultural system, it will destroy it the next day,” Orbán told Le Point. “Without transforming our farm subsidy system, we cannot let them in. The consequences will be terrible,” he added.

Instead, Orbán proposed “a strategic partnership treaty” to raise the level of EU-Ukraine cooperation without offering EU membership.

In an effort to sway the Hungarian leader, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted Orbán for a dinner in Paris on Thursday evening. But the Hungarian leader told Le Point he “cannot give up [his] position” on Ukraine.

“My idea is to try to convince him to listen to my arguments,” Orbán said. “I am very interested in his opinion on the reasons that push France to act in this way.”

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo responded to Orbán’s interview during the unveiling of the Belgian EU Council presidency program on Friday, saying that when there are “different opinions” it’s better to speak “face-to-face” rather than through the press or open letters, De Croo said.

"“I kind of want to live in the metaverse. There will be all the same stuff as my regular universe—friends, work, shopping, entertainment—but it will somehow be more thrilling. When I move, will I still be myself?”

—Virtual Horizons

CLOUD SUPPORT Spiritual Troubleshooting for the Digital Age For philosophical guidance on encounters with technology, open a support ticket via email; or register and post a comment below.

Dear Virtual,

It’s hard to believe that only two years have passed since we were promised the new dispensation—the digital universe where, as Mark Zuckerberg put it, we would “be able to express ourselves in new, joyful, completely immersive ways.” In the metaverse, brain surgeons in Scotland would operate on patients in New Zealand, and friends would gather in simulated space stations, luxurious alpine retreats, and enchanted forests. The soaring promo video at 2021’s Meta Connect suggested that the metaverse would remain untainted by the limitations of the real world—even, perhaps, the laws of physics. (One clip showed the novelist Octavia Butler saying, “There are no closed doors, no walls.”) It certainly was, as you say, thrilling. Amid the global pandemic’s alternating waves of fear and monotony, I don’t think anyone could have been faulted for wanting to decamp for something new. World without end, amen.

Since then, as you probably know, this dream has undergone the steady erosion of technological disenchantment. The fluid virtual bodies we were promised turned out to be boxy cartoon avatars. The Oculus headsets were awkward and, because the nondigital world is still one of doors and walls, its most enthusiastic users kept injuring themselves. Meta’s Horizon Worlds platform failed to hit its user targets, and several companies that had set up shop there, including Disney and Microsoft, pulled out.

But despite the many eulogies for the metaverse, the promise has not died and the technologies seem to be improving.

At the most recent Connect, in September, Zuckerberg spoke of the metaverse as less a destination than a process, one that is well underway. The world we currently occupy is already somewhat “meta,” he stressed, because it’s a blend of the physical and the digital, and the boundary between these realms will slowly blur into “this idea that we call the metaverse.” Screens will morph into headsets, physical objects will gradually be augmented by interactive holograms, and the mundane world we live in will mutate into something more glorious, almost without us noticing. Or we might already be in the metaverse? It’s hard to say. The concept has become a bit vague and tautological. As one writer for The Verge put it, “whatever Meta does is the metaverse, by definition.”

If I can venture a somewhat grand comparison, Virtual, the evolution of the metaverse recalls the fate of so many religious eschatologies, which the true believers are forced to adapt and reinterpret once their prophecies fail to materialize. When Christ spoke of the glories of the kingdom of God, many of his earliest followers believed he was speaking of an imminent revolution that would transform life on earth.",technology
"The Silicon Power UD90 2230 is the QLC-based, shorter sibling of the regular UD90. It’s a convenient and efficient way to add more storage to your Steam Deck or other portable gaming device, but it’s not the fastest option.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

If you have your heart set on 2TB of capacity for your Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, or other portable gaming system, you’re about to discover another great M.2 2230 SSD. The Silicon Power UD90 2230, which by name is a shorter version of the previous value champion UD90 , is an excellent choice for upgrading your internal storage. It’s not limited to 2TB; it is designed for 500GB and 1TB, but like most QLC drives, it’s best at higher capacity. Performance feels good enough, and you know what to expect from Silicon Power - a less expensive alternative to otherwise identical hardware from better-known manufacturers. But that’s not to say the UD90 2230 is without its surprises.

The UD90 2230 performs well in PCIe 3.0 mode and in the Steam Deck - which is restricted to PCIe 3.0 - but, as expected from QLC flash, it doesn’t peak as high with PCIe 4.0. Of course, there aren't many TLC options available at 2TB, with the best example being the OEM WD PC SN740 or its equivalent retail part in the WD Black SN770M. For QLC, there’s long been the OEM Micron 2400, but retail options have since ramped up, starting with the Sabrent Rocket Q4 2230 , Addlink S91 , Teamgroup MP44S , and the Inland QN446. This has put downward pressure on pricing, making 2TB fairly affordable for portable systems - which aren’t limited to gaming devices or even those with M.2 2230, as an extender works just fine for 2242 slots.

There is some question about whether or not a 2TB QLC SSD is needed: TLC options are more plentiful and performant at 1TB and below, and these drives also have had market pressure to lower prices. Portable systems universally have microSD slots and, in the worst case, can rely on external storage. However, these systems are often lovingly cared-for investments, and securing 2TB early for internal storage is tempting. That’s where drives like the UD90 2230 are best, but if you are on a strict budget, you can shave some off the price by going with QLC over TLC at lower capacities without too much loss, as demonstrated in this review.

The Silicon Power UD90 2230 is available at 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB, with only the last two SKUs being currently available for purchase. Those two are at $68.97 and $165.97, respectively, during the time of review. However, prices are rapidly changing, so be sure to engage in comparison shopping. Silicon Power rates this model for up to 5,000 / 3,200 MB/s, with the 500GB model rated at up to 4,700 / 1,700 MB/s.

The relatively low sequential write performance for the 500GB model suggests that it’s QLC, which is both good and bad. It’s a good thing because it might be a less expensive option at that capacity than the standard TLC drives. The Addlink S91 , which is QLC at 1TB and 2TB but not 512GB, uses BiCS5 TLC for the smallest capacity. TLC usually performs better, which is a negative for the UD90 2230, but on the other hand, BiCS5 is likely to be less efficient. Typically, QLC-based M.2 2230 drives don’t even have a 500/512GB option which makes the UD90 2230 a bit unique - if and when that SKU becomes available.

Silicon Power backs this drive with a 5-year warranty at up to 600TB of writes per TB capacity. This TBW rating is higher than competing QLC drives like the Inland QN446. That shouldn’t be an important consideration for this type of drive, but all else being equal, it could tip the scales in its favor.

Software and Accessories

Silicon Power has a bunch of software for download on its site. This includes an SSD toolbox, a versatile application that yields information on your system and storage with diagnostics and a way to update the drive’s firmware. SP’s other software ranges from file recovery to cloning to encryption, although freeware alternatives exist for many of these functions. Sometimes, it’s best to avoid OEM software solutions, although not all of them are in-house, as the file recovery download is Recuva.

A Closer Look

This is your standard M.2 2230 SSD. The UD90 2230 is a single-sided drive with an SSD controller and a single package of NAND. 2TB of capacity means that this package is stacked with 16 dies (HDP) of 1Tb QLC, the effective limit of current technology.

Stacking more dies can be challenging for multiple reasons, such as maintaining signal integrity. With this same Phison E21T controller and 512Gb TLC dies, models like the Corsair MP600 Mini faced such an issue that could lead to data loss in specific circumstances. A firmware fix is the cleanest solution, and Phison put out a new revision. In rare scenarios performance is reduced with that fix, but that also is being addressed. No such issue applies here, though, as stacked QLC is immune.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

You really have to hold one of these drives in your hands to fully grasp just how small it is, with the realization that this could pack in 4TB if it were double-sided. You always remember your first M.2 SSD, coming from either behemoth 3.5” HDDs or 2.5” SATA SSDs that once felt smallish. An M.2 2280 SSD feels tiny in comparison, and an M.2 2230 somehow reduces that by more than one-half more.

There’s a point here: be careful with these drives. They are delicate in some ways, but not in others. Luckily, it’s harder to bend these than full-length M.2 SSDs. Still, installation means working in a smaller space, so caution and patience are recommended. This is especially true when working with systems with a different offset for M.2 2230 or requiring an M.2 extender, as such installations are atypical. The UD90 2230 does not stand out in any particular way, but at least its single-sided nature does ensure easier handling.

"If the Trump appointees join a conservative majority to blow up the existing constitutional consensus, however, they will be turning their backs on the passionate defenses of originalism they made before the Senate Judiciary Committee. They will also be raising fundamental questions about their commitment to democratic principles: What gives nine unelected justices the authority to protect the rich when a democratically elected president and Congress decide that progressive taxation is in the public interest?

When it comes to adhering to originalist principles, the history is clear — as long as it’s not cherry-picked.

Quite simply, the Founders were not opposed to wealth taxes. Indeed, the Supreme Court unanimously approved the first wealth tax in 1796. Its successors consistently followed this precedent over the next century and upheld every tax statute that required the rich to pay more than the poor. Given these historical foundations, the Trump-appointed justices will destroy the credibility of their professed commitment to originalism if they vote to prohibit a wealth tax.

The opponents of wealth taxation in Moore try to counter this reality by relying on a single Supreme Court decision, Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co, decided in 1895. By a vote of 5 to 4, the Pollock majority overruled all previous Supreme Court precedents and struck down a statute that required the rich to pay income taxes but exempted Americans earning lower salaries.

Pollock’s break with a century of precedent provoked widespread shock and outrage. Within three years, Congress enacted another progressive tax — this one on inheritances. In doing so, it directly challenged the five conservative judges to reconsider their precedent-shattering position: Would they retreat in response to public opinion and acknowledge their blunder in Pollock by upholding the new statute even though it explicitly taxed inherited wealth?

In 1900, the Supreme Court provided a complicated answer to this question in Knowlton v. Moore. On the one hand, all nine justices upheld the inheritance tax, despite its obvious inconsistency with Pollock’s repudiation of wealth taxation. On the other hand, Knowlton refused to admit that Pollock was wrongly decided — and continued to treat the case as a valid precedent.

The public was not impressed. To the contrary, Knowlton convinced the congressional leadership that there was only one realistic way to override continuing judicial opposition and that was to enact a formal constitutional amendment repudiating Pollock. Since Knowlton had unanimously upheld a wealth tax on inheritances, however, the drafters of the amendment believed that it was only necessary to state that the national government had the power “to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.” They then devoted their time and energy to gaining the bipartisan support required to get two-thirds of the House and Senate to approve the income tax amendment.

Once they achieved this feat in 1909, they faced an even more formidable obstacle course since congressional proposals require ratification by a super-super-majority of three-fourths of the states before they are added to the Constitution and become the “supreme law of the United States.” Still, a nationwide grassroots movement successfully gained the requisite approval of 36 states within the space of four years. The 16th Amendment made it clear that the Supreme Court should never again look upon Pollock as a valid precedent for vetoing statutes passed by Congress that required the rich to pay more taxes than the middle and working classes.

On Dec. 5, 2023, the Supreme Court will be asked to repudiate the original understanding of the 16th Amendment. If the three Trump-appointed justices do so, they will be ignoring a century of history and blinding themselves to the original understanding of the millions of 20th century Americans who propelled the income tax amendment into the Constitution. It is one thing to make Pollock’s mistake once. It is very different to repeat it a second time.

What is more, Moore’s assertion of judicial power may well provoke a shattering constitutional confrontation with President Joe Biden or another future president if they choose to support a wealth tax. It’s an increasingly popular proposal in the Democratic Party, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Under her initiative, 99.9 percent of Americans would pay no wealth tax. Only families owning more than $50 million would pay a 2 percent annual tax on assets worth more than that amount. The rate moves up to 4 percent on assets of more than $175 million, hitting the richest 16,000 households in the country.

In estimating the yield from this tax during her 2020 presidential campaign, Warren relied on studies based on the economy’s performance in preceding decades. One of us, Bruce Ackerman, has updated the numbers in his forthcoming book, The Postmodern Predicament; it demonstrates that, even under conservative assumptions, such a proposal can yield $3 trillion a year under current economic conditions — and even more as GNP continues to grow over the coming decades. Its enactment would enable the Biden administration to reach out to the states and offer massive funding for well-organized programs providing free college education, universal child care and thoughtful elder care.

The stakes are high for the Supreme Court when it hears oral arguments in Moore. If the three Trump-appointed justices join their conservative colleagues in declaring wealth taxation unconstitutional, they will not only betray their originalist principles. They will also betray fundamental principles of American democracy — which leave it up to the voters, not the courts, to decide whether it is in the public interest for the super-rich to contribute generously to their fellow citizens’ struggle for a meaningful life in the 21st century.

"Fighting climate change by sucking carbon dioxide out of the air with giant blowers seems like a brilliant idea. Why knock yourself out trying to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions when you can continue to produce the emissions and then snatch them back from the atmosphere? That solution reminds me of the little red vehicle with robotic arms that the Cat in the Hat uses to clean up the house that he, Thing One and Thing Two have just trashed. “Have no fear of this mess,” the Cat in the Hat tells the children. “I always pick up all my playthings.”

But direct air capture of carbon, as the nascent technology is called, is not as reliable as Dr. Seuss’s three-wheeled deus ex machina. And it’s coming in for heavy criticism at COP28, the United Nations climate summit that’s happening in the desert city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “It’s incredibly dangerous for the fossil fuel industry and its enablers in government to promote the idea that they can keep burning fossil fuels while pulling carbon out of the air or out of the smokestacks with technologies that consistently fail to deliver,” Collin Rees, the U.S. program manager at Oil Change International, wrote in an email.

Direct air capture of carbon isn’t a completely bad idea. In fact, it’s going to have to be part of the solution to climate change eventually. That’s because in some sectors of the economy, it’s impossible or extremely costly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions all the way to zero. Jet aviation and cement production are two examples that people sometimes mention (although technological breakthroughs may change that). In such sectors, it’s more cost-effective to get to net zero by allowing a little carbon to dribble out and then cleaning it up through direct air capture.

So it makes sense to invest in research on the technology for the long run. I’m glad that the Biden administration is spending $3.5 billion to develop four regional hubs — the first two in Texas and Louisiana — to accelerate the development and deployment of direct air capture. Approaches differ, but the general idea is to push air through some kind of filter that separates out the carbon dioxide, then bury it in the ground or use it in manufacturing. The plan is to keep the energy-intensive process green by using electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind. “The science says we cannot get to net zero 2050” without some use of carbon capture, John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, said on Wednesday.",political
"Tesla will release its 2023 Holiday Update next week with a few big changes, including one that lets Teslas call 911 automatically if the car’s airbags deploy in a crash. On Thursday, the company announced the update is coming next week, and it highlighted other coming features like Apple Podcasts support, rear-screen Bluetooth headset support, an updated version of the park assistance with 3D visuals, and new blind spot indicators.

Apple Podcast support joins Apple Music, which Tesla added last year. Not a Tesla App reported yesterday that Tesla owners can sync podcasts with Apple devices. The site added other details about update 2023.44.25; for instance, Tesla owners won’t need a separate USB stick for every light show they want to use — now, the EVs will be able to read them all from a single storage drive. The site also writes that although the update will add B-pillar cameras to the Tesla app’s Live Sentry view, the cameras won’t record Dashcam and Sentry Mode events.

A video of the blind spot indicator posted by Not a Tesla App shows how a glowing red that shows up on the lane change camera’s video when the car detects another vehicle:

Tesla announced the extra features after someone complained on X, formerly Twitter, that leaks showed the update was “shitty,” and Tesla CEO Elon Musk replied saying, “We need to step up our game.” Past holiday updates have brought big features. Last year, besides Apple Music, the company added Steam integration (though not for everyone), and the year before that, TikTok and Sonic the Hedgehog.",technology

"SmileDirectClub, a Warby Parker-style company that sells 3D-printed teeth aligners online that are typically cheaper than braces, has asked some customers dissatisfied with the product to sign extremely restrictive nondisclosure agreements that stifle them from saying anything negative about the company in order to get a refund, according to a report from The New York Times published on Wednesday.

An excerpt of a SmileDirectClub NDA included in the NYT’s story said that the person signing “will not make, publish, or communicate any statements or opinions that would disparage, create a negative impression of, or in any way be harmful to the business or business reputation of SDC or its affiliates or their respective employees, officers, directors, products, or services.”

In an email to The Verge, a SmileDirectClub spokesperson says those parts of the agreement are “negotiable,” which is a good thing to know if you’re attempting to get a refund yourself. (If you find yourself unable to negotiate them away, please let us know.)

For its story, The New York Times spoke to seven people who said SmileDirectClub’s teeth aligners didn’t work, and four said they had to get additional dental work to correct problems created by the aligners. I also thought it was wild that SmileDirectClub has apparently had over 1,670 Better Business Bureau complaints since 2014.

SmileDirectClub’s aggressive tactics to shut down negative online conversation about its products also bring to mind tactics used by online mattress company Casper, as chronicled by Fast Company in 2017 (another story you should read, by the way).

Casper sued three mattress bloggers who recommended other mattresses over Casper, alleging false advertising and deceptive practices. (Casper claimed the mattress bloggers were not properly disclosing financial relationships with companies whose products they were promoting over Casper’s.) Eventually, all three sites settled with Casper, though two of them took down their negative reviews and one was bought by a company that had financial support from Casper shortly before the settlement was finalized.",technology
"Teresa Ribera said Sultan al-Jaber, the COP28 president and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, needed to take a more active role in the final days of the two-week-long talks | Martin Divisek/EFE via EPA

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The European Union says it’s time for the oil boss presiding over this year’s global climate talks to step up and push for a fossil fuel phaseout.

Spanish Ecological Transition Minister Teresa Ribera, who represents EU governments in the negotiations, said Sultan al-Jaber, the COP28 president and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, needed to take a more active role in the final days of the two-week-long talks, which are scheduled to end on Tuesday.

“We’re in the hard moment where we need the clear engagement of the president of the COP,” she told POLITICO in an interview on Saturday. “He should be playing not only the role of a moderator, but the role of a leader trying to identify how we can open this pathway toward the outcomes that we need to get.”

Ribera’s comments came as oil producers have stepped up their campaign against efforts to call for a phaseout of fossil fuels in the final COP28 agreement.

In a letter leaked to multiple news agencies on Friday night, the secretary-general of the OPEC oil cartel urged member countries — which include the UAE and Saudi Arabia — to reject any text that targets the production and consumption of fossil fuels.

""It seems that the undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels may reach a tipping point with irreversible consequences, as the draft decision still contains options on fossil fuels phase out,"" reads the letter, signed by Haitham Al Ghais.

Ribera — who called OPEC’s push against a fossil fuel phaseout “disgusting” in comments to reporters earlier on Saturday — told POLITICO she expects al-Jaber to make good on his promise to ensure this summit is a “turning point.”

“It’s clear that a vast majority of parties represented here want to see a clear pathway toward the decline and phaseout of fossil fuels,"" she said. ""But there are also some countries that would like to water down whatever is said about this.""

Speaking to reporters on Saturday, the UAE’s chief negotiator, Hana Al Hashimi, said: “The president has been very vocal on his desire to see an outcome on fossil fuels in the text.”

Al-Jaber will host ministers for discussions in the afternoon and evening on Saturday, before writing a new version of the deal.

The most recent draft negotiating text features four different options for language to describe the future of fossil fuels — all feature the phrase ""phase out"" alongside various qualifiers — as well as the option of having no fossil fuel mention at all. The EU, Ribera said, isn’t happy with any of the four choices in isolation.

Combining elements of all the options would be the only way to send a “consistent signal toward paving the way for a fossil fuel phaseout,” she said.

Ribera argued the final deal should include references to reaching a peak in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and guardrails around the use of carbon capture technology — a technology to trap or remove emissions that is unproven at scale.

“If we count only on watered down and weak text, that may backfire” against al-Jaber, she warned.",political
"Wash, who died last week at 65 after a battle with stomach cancer, ended up changing American politics with this theory, first upending the Massachusetts political world — and then setting a template for Barack Obama’s presidential win two years later. At the same time, he engendered a new generation of Democratic operatives — including David Axelrod and David Plouffe — inspired by his focus on building high-tech field organizations.

“You would not think this of a murky Massachusetts political organizer, but John would have found a home in Silicon Valley,’’ Plouffe said. “A very unique thing.”

It was in 2006 that Walsh, mastering the power of the then-developing Internet, had the chance to take grassroots organizing to new levels. Deval Patrick — who had no political profile, few if any contacts in the party’s rank and file, and no experience in electoral state politics — had decided that year to launch an insurgent campaign for governor. Walsh signed on to manage Patrick’s underfunded, very long-shot bid.

Patrick also hired an upstart consulting team from Chicago — David Axelrod and David Plouffe, who had played important roles in Barack Obama’s rise from an Illinois state senator to the U.S. Senate — and a much talked about future Democratic presidential candidate. The two were drawn to the way Walsh was running the Patrick campaign, intrigued that it may be a major organizing tool in an Obama presidential race.

At that time, field organizing had been overshadowed by the latest norm in campaigns — raise a huge amount of money, use focus groups to find out what voters are thinking, develop clever media messages and flood the airways. The idea that to win races, you had to be active on the ground was secondary.

Walsh, though, dug deep into the wards and precincts across the state, engineering a campaign that took Patrick from a political unknown to the party’s front runner. Plouffe and Axelrod watched as Walsh would drive, time and time again and often out of cell-phone range, to remote communities in the Berkshire hill-towns or to the outer villages of Cape Cod and precincts in the old mill cities in the Merrimack Valley — many times just to meet with two or three potential party activists, slowly but eventually building a state-wide network of Patrick supporters.

But the key to his success was his grasp of emerging technology and its use in building a vast but tightly organized field organization. With very little cost, the campaign allowed those volunteers, using their own computers, from their homes in every corner of the state, to be linked to the campaign website as well as to their neighbors, friends and relatives.

It provided the Patrick staff in Boston the ability to create and manage a field organization that Massachusetts had never seen before.

“It sounds simple now,’’ said Doug Rubin, Patrick’s 2006 campaign consultant. “But back then the idea of using the internet and websites was revolutionary in campaign work. It built an army of volunteers connected to our Boston office but also to themselves.”

Walsh’s success in building a vast, well-connected, state-wide army of volunteers, along with Patrick’s rhetorical skills and charisma, carried Patrick to a landslide primary win by a two-to-one margin against the Democratic establishment’s favorite — Attorney General Tom Reilly — and a trouncing of the Republican nominee for governor in the general election, the incumbent lieutenant governor.

Walsh’s engineering of Patrick’s rise from political obscurity to the governor’s office was indeed historic. Patrick became Massachusetts’s first Black governor, only the second African American governor in America since Reconstruction. He also broke a Democratic losing streak; it was the first time a Democrat had won the governor’s race in the state since 1986.

But little did the political world understand at the time that Walsh’s strategies and expertise would be a model for Obama’s come-from-behind surge to win the 2008 Democratic nomination. In his book, the Audacity to Win, Plouffe credited Walsh with showing him and Axelrod a playbook for Obama’s 2008 presidential race.

Describing their experience in Massachusetts, Plouffe wrote, “We worked with a campaign that was doing some fascinating and new stuff using the internet to organize and communicate message (sic) — from scratch, like we would have to do.”

Nearly two decades later, Plouffe still marvels at Walsh’s ability to harness social media and the Internet to build a political organization from scratch.

“It was like the dawn of a new era,” he said, reflecting back on what he and Axelrod learned from Walsh. “It was revelatory to me.”

It’s especially intriguing, he said, that it all came from someone Plouffe initially considered just another rough-edged Massachusetts political operative. Instead, he discovered a brilliant political mind.

Walsh’s success in his first state-wide campaign prompted a beleaguered Senator Edward Markey, facing a daunting 2020 reelection challenge from U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III, to hire him. The odds of defeating the heir to the state’s most famous political dynasty seemed low. But in the end, it wasn’t even that close. Walsh’s grassroots organizing skills was a key reason for why the Kennedy family was dealt its first defeat in Massachusetts since Jack Kennedy’s 1946 election to Congress.

To be sure, there were some defeats as well. One came during his long tenure as the chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party when the party failed to hold the late U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s senate seat in 2010. It was a national embarrassment.

Walsh’s profile was anything but flashy. He grew up the son of Irish immigrants in the small Massachusetts town of Abington, just south of Boston. He lived there most of his life, running a small insurance company.

His humility was legendary. Many of his friends and longtime acquaintances were shocked to learn he was a Princeton University graduate. He was a polar opposite to the swashbuckling political consultants that now populate political campaigns. Nor was he ever a good source for political reporters looking for gossip and opposition research on other candidates.

Until Patrick hired him for his 2006 campaign, Walsh had little name recognition, even among seasoned political reporters. He had worked mainly in local politics in the South Shore area of Massachusetts, one of the few regions where Republicans can win local elections.

But his combination of never-ending optimism, his profound love of politics and his gentle demeanor in the midst of the chaos of campaigns eventually made him a legend in Massachusetts Democratic politics.

“John was just someone who treated everyone the same, whether you were a U.S. senator or a volunteer,” said Rubin, Patrick’s political consultant. “He was always optimistic and had an unending belief in people.’’",political
"This morning, Vice published an extensive investigation examining the rumors that future worm-rider Timothée Chalamet had a previous life as an Xbox 360 controller modder. The investigation includes contributions from Aric Toller, a lead researcher and trainer at Bellingcat, a journalism outfit regularly known for investigating war crimes.

The collaboration between the two noted journalism outfits is extensive. Vice reporters Matthew Gault and Emanuel Maiberg worked with Toller to examine images of Chamalet’s hands, and specifically a scar on his left ring finger, and compare them to screenshots of the hands of anonymous Youtuber ModdedController 360. They also carefully examined images of a young Chamalet’s bedroom that the actor had previously posted to Instagram and compared those images to footage from the Youtube channel.

“Ya, seems like it’s him,” Toller told Vice.

A fact that likely would have been confirmed had Vice followed Youtuber Nate Hill, who interviewed Chalamet and Zendaya last week for Dune. There Chalamet immediately laid the rumors to rest. “I actually had a YouTube channel people found. It’s youtube.com/moddedcontroller360.”",technology
"As Barton began his presentation, I slipped away to a parlor room at the back of the sanctuary. Connelly wanted me to meet three local pastors who stood for truth. Seated around a large, rectangular folding table were Connelly; Donald Eason, the pastor of Metro Church of Christ in Sterling Heights; Jeffrey Hall, the pastor of Community Faith Church in Holt; and Dominic Burkhard, who described himself as “a full-time missionary to the legislature in Lansing.”

Connelly opened by summarizing for his friends the conversations we’d been having about political activism tearing churches apart. Clearly expecting that they would back him up, Connelly announced that he’d seen no such thing in his tour of hundreds of churches around the country, and asked the pastors to weigh in.

“There’s definitely some political divisions here in Michigan churches,” said Hall.

Eason nodded. “Lots of political division.”

“Covid definitely drew some lines,” Hall continued. “I had people calling and emailing our church asking if we were open. They had come from churches that closed, and they wanted to know if we were taking a hard stance against the government. I never wanted to make a war with the government. We closed for about a month. I just wanted to honor God. But some people weren’t looking for that.”

I reminded Connelly of the story of FloodGate Church, which had made war with the government and increased its membership tenfold. The church’s expansive new campus was miles away from where we were sitting. Connelly gave me a far-off look that had become familiar by this point.

“He’s talking about Bill Bolin,” Eason chimed in.

I asked Eason how he knew about FloodGate’s pastor.

“Oh, I know about Bolin,” Eason said with an uneasy smile. “We all know about Bolin.”

Connelly claimed not to know about Bolin. So the others filled him in — the refusal to comply during Covid, the cries of martyrdom, the alliances with far-right politicians and activists, the Nazi salute he’d given from the pulpit to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

“Well, he’d be a unicorn in our crowd,” Connelly said. “I don’t know any other pastors like that.”

But Connelly had just been in San Diego with Charlie Kirk and a small army of pastors exactly like that. It was true that much of the turmoil in churches was coming from the bottom up, with radicalized members rebelling against the insufficient political efforts of their pastors. But it was also true that a growing number of conservative pastors were doing just what Bolin had done at FloodGate. Meanwhile, it was the pastors who refused — the pastors who didn’t want to host the American Restoration Tour in their sanctuaries — whom Connelly had deemed “squishes.”

We had come full circle from our conversation at the Ohio capitol. Connelly told me then that pastors “failed us” by not getting their churches involved with politics. Now he was doubling down.

“Do you know what the research tells us is the biggest reason people leave church? They say it’s not relevant. Why would they come when the pastor isn’t teaching me how to think through the issues?” Connelly said. “Christianity should permeate the culture, not be separated from it.”

The way for Christianity to permeate the culture, he insisted, was by tackling these great debates of our time: abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism. I didn’t bother questioning why Connelly always listed the same narrow set of topics; the answer was apparent. Talking about other clear-cut biblical issues — such as caring for the poor, welcoming the refugee, refusing the temptation of wealth — did not animate the conservative base ahead of an election.

There were more pressing questions on my mind. Connelly’s organization was called “Faith Wins,” but what did that even mean? Could faith really win or lose something? It all just felt so trivial. If we believe that Jesus has defeated death, why are we consumed with winning a political campaign? Why should we care that we’re losing power on this earth when God has the power to forgive sins and save souls? And why should we obsess over America when Jesus has gifted us citizenship in heaven?

Burkhard, the lobbyist-slash-missionary in Lansing, jumped in.

“People need to be saved and America needs to be saved. It’s perfectly good to want both,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with trying to save America. Somebody needs to try to do it. Somebody needs to try to save America.”

Eason, seated to Burkhard’s right, shook his head in disagreement. The more we’d been talking about this, he confessed, the more uneasy he felt. He believed, like Connelly did, that Christianity was in the crosshairs of the American left. But he had just preached a sermon that was weighing on him. It was about the uniqueness of the early Christian Church. He had described for his congregation how Christians had gained influence — and won converts — by being countercultural, by rejecting the trends that preoccupied so much of the world around them. American evangelicals, Eason said, would do well to study that tradition.

“Our goal should be to save souls, not to save America. The reality is, we can’t save America anyway, unless we’re saving those souls first,” he said to Burkhard. “We can fight for America all day long, but if we don’t save the people here, it won’t matter.”

The great obstacle to saving souls, I suggested, wasn’t drag queen performances or critical race theory. It was the perception among the unbelieving masses — the very people these evangelicals were called to evangelize — that Christians care more about reclaiming lost social status than we do about loving our neighbor as ourselves. I relayed what one local church leader had told me about evangelicals: “Too many of them worship America.”

Connelly looked incredulous. He turned to his pastor friends. “I don’t see that happening,” he told them. “You see any of that?”

“Oh, I see it,” Hall said. “I know of a pastor who just recently stood up in his pulpit and told people that they’re insane if they vote Democrat this fall.”

Eason had similar stories to tell. I pointed out that Al Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, one of America’s most prominent Christian conservatives, had recently said something similar. This was not an anomaly. Pastors and church officials and evangelical leaders were feeling the pressure to classify Jesus as a registered Republican — and they were feeling it from people like Chad Connelly.

Thoroughly flustered now, Connelly argued that if pastors didn’t address current events head-on, the Christians in their care would resort to “secular sources” to form their political viewpoints. The way to ensure that Christians vote biblical values, he said, was for pastors to preach politics.

This struck me as completely backward. If pastors were doing their job — going deep in the word, discipling their flocks, stressing scripture and prayer above social media and talk radio — their people wouldn’t need to be infantilized with explicit partisan endorsements. Those Christians would know how to vote biblically, because they would know their Bible.

Connelly whipped his head back and forth. “I’d love to meet a pastor who thinks he’s doing a good enough job discipling to where he doesn’t need to engage with this stuff, because that pastor is deceived. He’s badly deceived,” he said. “I’ve told my Sunday School class: Don’t tell anybody you’re doing a good job telling people about Jesus, because we’re losing the culture. If we were doing a good job telling people about Jesus, we wouldn’t be losing the culture.”

This fixation on winning and losing was revealing. In the sanctuary behind us, a body of Christians had just sat through an hourlong lecture that was designed to make them more powerful citizens. They were supposed to take the information Barton had given them, Connelly instructed, then charge into the trenches of America’s political battlefield.

And yet, there was no instruction on how to fight. There was no perspective on the appropriate way to win. There was no lesson on what John Dickson, an Australian theologian I’d met at Wheaton College, described as “losing well.” This was very much by design. Because losing, in the eyes of men like Connelly and Barton, was no longer an option. “The stakes are too high,” Connelly told me at one point, to cede any ground to the opposition.

Unsavory alliances would need to be forged. Sordid tactics would need to be embraced. The first step toward preserving Christian values, it seemed, was to do away with Christian values.

"The biggest fight of the generative AI revolution is headed to the courtroom—and no, it’s not about the latest boardroom drama at OpenAI. Book authors, artists, and coders are challenging the practice of teaching AI models to replicate their skills using their own work as a training manual.

The debate centers on the billions of works underpinning the impressive wordsmithery of tools like ChatGPT, the coding prowess of Github’s Copilot, and artistic flair of image generators like that of startup Midjourney. Most of the works used to train the underlying algorithms were created by people, and many of them are protected by copyright.

AI builders have largely assumed that using copyrighted material as training data is perfectly legal under the umbrella of “fair use”—after all, they’re only borrowing the work to extract statistical signals from it, not trying to pass it off as their own. But as image generators and other tools have proven able to impressively mimic works in their training data, and the scale and value of training data has become clear, creators are increasingly crying foul.

At LiveWIRED in San Francisco, the 30th anniversary event for WIRED magazine, two leaders of that nascent resistance sparred with a defender of the rights of AI companies to develop the technology unencumbered. Did they believe AI training is fair use? “The answer is no, I do not,” said Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, which represents book authors and is suing both OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, for violating the copyright of its members.

From left to right: WIRED senior writer Kate Knibbs discussed creators' rights and AI with Mike Masnick, Mary Rasenberger, and Matthew Butterick at LiveWIRED in San Francisco,. Photograph: Aldo Chacon

Existential Risk

At the core of the Authors Guild’s complaint is that OpenAI and others’ use of their material ultimately produces competing work when users ask a chatbot to spit out a poem or image. “This is a highly commercial use, and the harm is very clear,” Rasenberger said. “It could really destroy the profession of writing. That’s why we’re in this case.” The Authors Guild, which is building a tool that will help generative AI companies pay to license its members’ works, believes there can be perfectly ethical ways to train AI. “It’s very simple: get permission,” she said. In most cases, permission will come for a fee.

Mike Masnick, CEO of the Techdirt blog and also the Copia Institute, a tech policy think tank, has a different view. “I’m going to say the opposite of everything Mary just said,” he said. Generative AI is fair use, he argued, noting the similarities of the recent legal disputes with past lawsuits, some involving the Author’s Guild, in which indexing creative works so that search engines could efficiently find them survived challenges.

A win for artist groups would not necessarily be of much help to individual writers, Masnick added, calling the very concept of copyright a scheme that was intended to enrich publishers, rather than protect artists. He referenced what he called a “corrupt” system of music licensing that sends little value to its creators.

While any future courtroom verdicts will likely depend on legal arguments over fair use, Matthew Butterick, a lawyer who has filed a number of lawsuits against generative AI companies, says the debate is really about tech companies that are trying to accrue more power—and hold onto it. “They’re not competing to see who can be the richest anymore; they’re competing to be the most powerful,” he said. “What they don’t want is for people with copyrights to have a veto over what they want to do.”

Masnick responded that he was also concerned about who gains power from AI, arguing that requiring tech companies to pay artists would further entrench the largest AI players by making it too expensive for insurgents to train their systems.

Rasenberger scoffed at the suggestion of a balance of power between tech players and the authors she represents, comparing the $20,000 per year average earnings for full-time authors to the recent $90 billion valuation of OpenAI. “They’ve got the money. The artist community does not,” she said.",technology

"God of War Ragnarök is getting a free DLC this month. During The Game Awards, mere moments after Kratos’ voice actor Christopher Judge made his triumphant (but far less winded) return to the stage, Sony Santa Monica debuted new DLC for 2018’s Game of the Year — God of War Ragnarök Valhalla.

God of War Ragnarök Valhalla is free DLC launching on the PS5 on December 12th. The DLC is set after the final battle of God of War Ragnarök and will feature Big Daddy Kratos and his BBF (that’s bodyless best friend) Mimir as they take on dungeons filled with monsters. The game will feature roguelike elements, where, upon death Kratos will reawaken outside the gates of Vahalla to try to defeat its challenges yet again.

“During each attempt, you will learn and adapt to the challenges Valhalla has to offer,” Sony shared on its blog. “The more you overcome, the more resources you’ll gain that can be put towards permanent upgrades that affect both Kratos and even Valhalla itself.”

Death shouldn’t be that daunting to Kratos, considering the man has died, gone to hell, and broke out again a couple of times now.",technology
"General Motors (GM) will slash spending in its self-driving car unit Cruise, after an accident last month seriously injured a pedestrian and prompted regulators to retract its operating permit for driverless cars in San Francisco.

The company will “substantially lower” its spending on Cruise next year, according to Mary Barra, GM’s CEO. “We expect the pace of Cruise’s expansion to be more deliberate when operations resume,” she said in a letter to shareholders.

On an investor call, chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said that he expected spending to fall by “hundreds of millions of dollars” in 2024. Until the accident, Cruise had been operating driverless taxis in three US cities—San Francisco, Phoenix, and Austin—with plans to expand. In October, the company said it would no longer operate its vehicles without safety drivers behind the wheel.

“Our priority now is to focus the team on safety, transparency, and accountability,” Barra said on Wednesday. “We must rebuild trust with regulators at the local, state, and federal levels, as well as with the first responders and the communities in which Cruise will operate.”

She added: “This is important technology for the future. From a societal and safety perspective, it's got to be done right.”

Cruise has been in turmoil since its CEO, Kyle Vogt, resigned earlier this month following an accident where a driverless car collided with a pedestrian, who had already been struck by a human hit-and-run driver.

The robotaxi swerved and braked, but still hit the woman, according to Cruise, which cited data from cameras and sensors mounted on its vehicle. The company said the vehicle stopped, but then pulled over to move out of traffic, dragging the woman 20 feet along the road. She later had to be rescued from underneath the vehicle by the San Francisco fire department.

Following the collision, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles said it had suspended Cruise’s permits to operate in the city on the grounds that the company had “misrepresented” the safety of its autonomous vehicle technology, and that its “vehicles are not safe for the public's operation.” At the time, Cruise disputed the claim it had misrepresented its technology.

Cruise then recalled all 950 driverless vehicles in its fleet, shutting down its service in Austin and Phoenix. Before the accident, the company had plans for commercial launches in Dallas, Houston, and Miami.

Logs maintained by the city of Austin also show the Austin Police Department complained twice this year that Cruise driverless vehicles did not understand hand signals given by traffic police. “Biggest and probably the most dangerous issues [sic] I’ve seen with them is when we are directing traffic,” one police official wrote, noting that if police issued commands contrary to traffic lights, the cars “will blow through or just stop.”

General Motors acquired 3-year-old Cruise for a reported $1 billion in 2016. Since then, GM’s financial reports show it has lost $​​8.2 billion on Cruise since 2017 and has sunk at least $1.9 billion into the company this year.

Barra’s announcement is a major setback for the company, which had been competing with Alphabet’s Waymo to become the main provider of driverless taxis in the US. Waymo continues to operate in San Francisco and Phoenix.",technology
"Part of / Building for tomorrow

At CES in 2021, 5G was just about everywhere you looked. It was the future of mobile communications that would propel autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and AR into reality. The low latency! The capacity! It’ll change everything, we were told. Verizon and AT&T wrote massive checks for new spectrum licenses, and T-Mobile swallowed another network whole because it was very important to make the 5G future happen as quickly as possible and win the race.

CES 2024 is just around the corner, and while telecom executives were eager to shout about 5G to the rafters just a few years ago, you’ll probably be lucky to hear so much as a whisper about it this time around. While it’s true that 5G has actually arrived, the fantastic use cases we heard about years ago haven’t materialized. Instead, we have happy Swifties streaming concert footage and a new way to get internet to your home router. These aren’t bad things! But deploying 5G at the breakneck speeds required to win an imaginary race resulted in one fewer major wireless carrier to choose from and lots of debt to repay. Now, network operators are looking high and low for every bit of profit they can drum up — including our wallets.

If there’s a poster child for the whole 5G situation in the US, it’s Verizon: the loudest and biggest spender in the room. The company committed $45.5 billion to new spectrum in 2021’s FCC license auction — almost twice as much as AT&T. And we don’t have to guess whether investors are asking questions about when they’ll see a return — they asked point blank in the company’s most recent earnings call. CEO Hans Vestberg fielded the question, balancing the phrases “having the right offers for our customers” and “generating the bottom line for ourselves,” while nodding to “price adjustments” that also “included new value” for customers. It was a show of verbal gymnastics that meant precisely nothing.

Verizon in particular has cried 5G wolf more than once

But in an indirect way, the whole rest of Verizon’s earnings update gives us a good picture of exactly how 5G is going for the carrier. There’s no talk of robot surgery or fleets of autonomous cars. As it turns out, you need a standalone 5G network to deploy a lot of those things — something carriers are still building out gradually. Verizon in particular is guilty of crying 5G wolf more than once. First, it tried to tell us that mmWave was the real 5G, which is fast but way too range-limited for any of those use cases. Then, it tried to sell us on low-band 5G, which actually turned out to be slower than 4G in some cases. The company is now slowly converting its existing network into standalone 5G as it lights up mid-band spectrum, but that’s a yearslong effort.

On that earnings call, Vestberg did point to a pillar of Verizon’s current 5G strategy that doesn’t require a complete overhaul of the company’s nationwide network: selling private networks, or secure, high-bandwidth networks, for industrial and manufacturing businesses. But as another investor on the recent earnings call notes, it was hardly mentioned outside of some passing remarks about its potential. What gives?

Vestberg says that this is coming along slowly. One problem standing in the company’s way, RCR Wireless News editor-in-chief Sean Kinney explains to The Verge, is that carriers aren’t really set up to sell their services to specific industries. “If you’re going to sell 5G and edge computing services to a hospital, you need a sales organization that understands healthcare. That knows exactly how hospitals run, knows what their problems are. You need that for every vertical industry — for transportation, logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing and hospitality. And that’s just a hard thing to do.”

Bringing 5G to sectors like manufacturing isn’t exactly a snap of the fingers, either. Not every kind of manufacturer even needs or wants 5G, for starters. Kinney says there’s potential in certain kinds of manufacturing like automotive, but lots of factories tend to be, well, old and don’t lend themselves well to fast upgrades. “How do I put a SIM card in a robotic arm that I bought in 1982? You can do it, but was it worth it? Did it actually deliver?”

“How do I put a SIM card in a robotic arm that I bought in 1982?”

Instead, there’s one 5G use case where the big three networks are finding traction, and it comes up over and over again in their earnings reports: fixed wireless access, or FWA. If you’re keeping score at home, that’s internet that comes to your house over radio waves rather than a cable. T-Mobile and Verizon have aggressively expanded their FWA offerings over the past couple of years, and even “fiber is everything” AT&T is getting in on the action with Internet Air. It’s nice for people to have more than one option for high-speed internet, but it’s hardly robot surgery — it’s not even necessarily the best way to improve the dismal state of home broadband.

If there’s a real, transformative benefit to 5G, it will likely be a combination of network advances and changes in behavior. People will start to see 5G working in situations where they wouldn’t expect to have a reliable data connection — just ask any of the Taylor Swift fans who moved a collective 29 terabytes of data on AT&T’s network in a single day on her Arlington, Texas, Eras Tour stop. Those kinds of crowded stadium events are where 5G’s extra capacity really outshines LTE.

AT&T spokesperson Jim Greer points out that the company has also seen a 30 percent annual increase in traffic on its network overall and said in an emailed statement to The Verge that “the 5G network is the ‘killer app’ that will change how we live and work.” Maybe 5G wasn’t a destination, it was a journey, etc. There’s something to that — when you realize you actually can stream video from a packed stadium or that you don’t have to wait until you’re at home on Wi-Fi to download something, your thinking changes about what you can expect from your connection.

Jeff Fieldhack, a director at Counterpoint Research, also sees real potential in network slicing, where carriers can give priority to certain kinds of network traffic. That’s important for safety-critical applications, like autonomous cars. Fieldhack says that slicing would allow networks to “prioritize the car going in through the intersection and not the YouTuber in the backseat.” Right now, they can’t distinguish between the two. There’s just one catch: as mentioned previously, you need a standalone 5G network to make that work. That’s something that only T-Mobile has achieved on a nationwide scale. AT&T’s and Verizon’s 5G networks still rely largely on 4G cores, and the switch to standalone 5G is a slow, yearslong project that is ongoing.

Even if 5G isn’t all smoke and mirrors, networks have backed themselves into a corner

Maybe 5G isn’t entirely smoke and mirrors. But by rolling it out with a breakneck “race,” networks backed themselves into a corner. They took on piles of debt; on that recent earnings call, a Verizon exec talked about the company’s desire to return to pre-spectrum-auction levels of debt. In the meantime, there are few returns to show for those investments — not helped by the fact that interest levels are high and smartphone sales are down. The networks thought they had a golden goose with 5G, but so far, it’s just laying regular old eggs — expensively, at that. And while they’re waiting for their efforts to bear fruit, they’re looking for other ways to boost their bottom line.

The simplest way to make more money is what Verizon calls “pricing actions.” That’s a nice way of saying “charging customers more.” The company boasted about implementing “over one billion dollars of annualized pricing actions in 2023” and pats itself on the back for keeping churn — that would be customers ditching Verizon — low in spite of it.

Maybe that’s because switching carriers is a chore that most people don’t want to undertake or that we’re all just numb to inflation-related price increases. But it probably doesn’t help that most of us have just two other networks to choose from even if we were determined to jump ship. And that’s one more piece of the 5G puzzle that’s missing: the fourth wireless carrier that was supposed to materialize from T-Mobile’s Sprint acquisition deal.

We know the story: T-Mobile was allowed to gobble up Sprint by selling Boost to Dish Network, which would use it as a springboard to become the country’s fourth wireless carrier while building its own standalone 5G network from scratch. One in, one out. How’s that going? Well, Dish has hit the coverage requirements set by the FCC as part of the deal. But it’s not as simple as “if you build it, they will come.” When it was sold to Dish, Boost had 9 million subscribers; now it has 7.5 million. And according to founder Charlie Ergen on the company’s last earnings call, of those 7.5 million people, the “vast majority” don’t have a phone that works on Dish’s own network. Instead, they run on the networks of AT&T or T-Mobile, which Dish contracts with as an MVNO.

More phones are starting to support Dish’s network bands, including the iPhone 15. But according to Ergen, the timing of T-Mobile’s shutdown of Sprint’s legacy CDMA network meant that Dish had to hurry up and replace a lot of phones for customers at a time when most new phones didn’t support the new network. Those customers likely aren’t ready to replace their phones just yet. Dish will next face its steepest challenge yet: covering 70 percent — and 75 percent, in some cases — of the population in each economic area where it holds certain spectrum licenses. In its Q3 earnings filings, the company said it “may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others” to hit that target. Doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.",technology

BRUSSELS — A few months before confessing to the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the European Parliament, Pier Antonio Panzeri had some advice for a friend.

“Don’t put yourself out of the game,” Panzeri told the Belgian MEP Maria Arena in August 2022 during a meal at the now-defunct Salvarino pizzeria in Brussels. “Because if you are in the game, then I am going to amass more money.”

Unbeknownst to the pair, Belgian spies were taping their conversation as part of an investigation into what would become known as Qatargate, according to a police summary of a declassified secret services report seen by POLITICO.

Four months later, Panzeri, a former MEP, was arrested and accused of being at the center of a bribery ring pushing the interests of Morocco, Qatar and Mauritania in Parliament. Police found more than €600,000 in cash at his home. Three sitting MEPs were arrested and handed preliminary charges: Eva Kaili, Marc Tarabella and Andrea Cozzolino, all of whom deny criminal wrongdoing.

Not among those rounded up: Arena.

The nature of Arena’s involvement — or lack of involvement — in Qatargate is one of the scandal’s most enduring mysteries. Investigative files seen by POLITICO reveal that Belgian authorities have amassed evidence showing she was close to Panzeri, met with Qatari and Moroccan officials accused of leading their country’s corruption efforts, and took actions in Parliament favorable to both countries.

And yet, nearly a year since the corruption scandal broke, investigators seem unable to determine whether she was a knowing participant — or merely an innocent, if deeply naïve, victim of her close political collaborators.

Arena — who inherited Panzeri’s prestigious chairmanship of the Parliament’s human rights committee when he retired in 2019 — has steadfastly maintained her innocence. She has not been arrested, charged or even questioned by Belgian authorities. Police raided her properties in July and asked federal prosecutors to petition the Parliament to lift her immunity — according to two people familiar with the investigation.

The Belgian prosecutor’s office said last week that it would not request the lifting of Arena’s immunity because there is no justification for doing so, criticizing “numerous false statements recently published in certain media and linked to this case.”

The announcement implies the prosecutor’s office “does not plan to prosecute” Arena, her lawyers Michèle Hirsch and Morgan Bonneure said in a statement Monday. They called on investigators to formally question her so she can clear her name.

“All the accusations and insinuations that Maria Arena is subject to are unfounded and inaccurate,” they wrote.

Marc Uyttendaele, a lawyer for Panzeri, said he would not comment publicly on the case.

In January, Arena gave up her role as chair of the human rights committee after POLITICO revealed she failed to declare a trip paid by Qatar (for which she blamed her assistant). Since then, she has kept a low profile, while going about her job as an MEP in the Socialists and Democrats grouping.

‘Tight collaboration’

Belgian investigators place Arena at the corruption ring’s very center, but they haven’t been able to establish whether she was part of it or just innocently caught up in it.

Panzeri and his assistant Francesco Giorgi “seem to work in very tight collaboration” with Arena, according to a police summary of a January 2023 note from the Belgian secret services. “They also give her advice, instructions, and they organize her agenda as well as some of her meetings.”

Arena “would take on actions that were initiated by Panzeri before (organizing meetings, debates, orientations, press statements, etc),” Giorgi told investigators, according to transcripts of statements he made to police. He added that she was one of the most important people in the network. Two police notes also state that she “works for the network.”

In his statements, Giorgi, who has been charged with corruption, acknowledged playing a major role in the scheme. His lawyer Pierre Monville wrote in an email: “As you know this case is particularly touchy, and I can not make any comment about the ongoing investigation.”

Arena was one of the first people that Giorgi’s partner Eva Kaili — a former Parliament vice-president — called in a panic after his arrest on December 9, according to a transcript of Kaili’s statements to the police in an interview 10 days later.

Kaili was also arrested and jailed on December 9.

In a conversation with the police, Kaili described Arena as Panzeri’s “alter-ego,” according to a legal order issued by the investigative judge to look into Arena’s communications in July this year.

The European Parliament has few legislative powers on human rights, but it wields soft power to pressure abusive regimes across the globe by voting on monthly resolutions and holding debates in the human rights subcommittee, known as DROI, which was chaired by Panzeri from 2017 to 2019, then by Arena until she stepped down in 2023.

In a December 2021 conversation recorded by the Belgian secret services, Panzeri told Arena she should stay in the human rights committee “for reasons we know.”

“I know it,” Arena replied, according to the transcript.

Arena was part of a “quadrumvirate” of MEPs who “struck with precision” to knock out parliamentary work critical of Qatar in December 2021, according to text messages sent to Panzeri from one of his former parliamentary assistants that are quoted in an arrest warrant for Cozzolino. A year later in the lead-up to the FIFA World Cup, Arena and Panzeri discussed blocking another resolution about Qatar, this time by Raphaël Glucksmann, Arena’s colleague from the Socialists group, according to police transcripts of their conversations by phone.

Arena’s name also appears 16 times in an Excel spreadsheet that Panzeri’s former assistant Giorgi told police he used as proof that he and his boss were delivering influence operations for Qatar and Morocco, according to Giorgi’s statements to police, as well as a copy of the document itself.

According to Giorgi’s spreadsheet, Arena attacked the human rights record of Morocco’s rival Algeria, praised Qatar’s labor reforms in an official press release, promoted Panzeri’s Fight Impunity NGO in the Parliament, and organized a debate critical of the United Arab Emirates in her committee. Qatar and the UAE are regional rivals.

“In Panzeri’s network, there are two kinds of actors,” Giorgi told the police in an interview. “Those who are aware of the organization and corruption [and] those who feel obliged.”

Arena has insisted she was not paid, or even influenced, by anyone.

According to transcripts of Tarabella’s police interview, Arena told him after the scandal broke: “I have the impression that they’ve monetized us.”

‘Professional friendship’

In addition to working together, Panzeri and Arena were personally close. Arena told POLITICO earlier this year that her relationship with Panzeri was a “professional friendship.”

“I do not know if they had agreements,” Giorgi told police investigators.

Emails seen by POLITICO show that Arena organized a surprise 65th birthday party for Panzeri at her home in June 2020. At Panzeri’s apartment in Schaerbeek — a stone’s throw from where Arena lives — he was using a photo of Arena as a bookmark, according to the Belgian secret services’ findings on Arena summarized by the police.

Panzeri and Giorgi have sung different tunes when it comes to Arena in their statements to investigators.

In notes found by police in his apartment, Giorgi described her as Panzeri’s “fundamental pillar of action.” Panzeri, by contrast, cleared Arena of any wrongdoing — with tears in his eyes, according to his lawyers.

Arena has also had Panzeri’s back. When the scandal exploded, she helped him find a legal team, she said in an interview with French-language newspapers.

What might Arena have gotten out of this relationship?

Panzeri proposed to help Arena rise to a human rights position at the U.N., according to Kaili’s conversations with police, or to become the EU’s special representative for human rights, according to Giorgi. (Arena said she had been approached for the EU role.)

“It seems to us to be particularly striking that Maria Arena would be the only one to occupy a key post in the network without benefiting from any kind of compensation,” police wrote in a confidential document.

Qatar connection

Since the scandal broke, Arena has denied that her parliamentary work was unduly influenced in favor of Qatar, Morocco or Mauritania.

In January, she told POLITICO she had not renewed an informal “memorandum of understanding” Panzeri had struck with the Qatari government when he ran the human rights committee.

This does not square with her own words or internal emails from the Parliament obtained by POLITICO.

Arena mentioned “our protocol between them [the Qataris] and the subcommittee” in an email to senior EU official Mychelle Rieu in February 2020. In another interview that year, Arena talked about Panzeri’s deal as being still active, threatening to bin it if she didn’t see progress on human rights from Qatar.

The spreadsheet Giorgi used to justify payments from Qatar and Morocco lists the “renewal of the memorandum between QATAR & DROI” during her stewardship of the committee.

Arena also met with Panzeri’s closest contacts in the Qatari government. Public records and police files show that she met Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri — the person investigators have accused in an application for an international arrest warrant of leading his country’s corruption effort — at least four times in three years during his visits to Parliament.

The last meeting, which happened just before the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, was the most sensitive: Al Marri was in Arena’s committee to field questions from European lawmakers on the labor rights of construction workers — which had been at the center of a heated debate in Europe, amid calls from politicians to boycott the competition.

In a statement to police, Giorgi said that he and Panzeri prepped Al Marri for the meeting, with Panzeri even dictating the Qatari minister’s speech.

When Al Marri’s grilling was over, Arena immediately called Panzeri, according to a transcript of a conversation secretly recorded by the police.

“You have been excellent,” Panzeri told her.

“So, is the minister happy?” she asked.

In text messages the pair exchanged in January 2022, Panzeri told her to reserve time slots to meet Qatari officials and informed her that a Qatari woman would arrive in Brussels on February 18. Arena met Maryam bint Abdullah Al Attiyah, who succeeded Al Marri as head of Qatar’s national human rights body, that day, according to Arena’s declarations.

Uncle Atmoun

Arena was also acquainted with Panzeri’s connection to Morocco, Rabat’s ambassador to Poland Abderrahim Atmoun.

Arena dined with Atmoun and Panzeri at the Gioia Italian restaurant in Brussels in January 2022. According to a police summary of a transcript of their conversation taped by the Belgian secret service, Atmoun invited Arena and Panzeri for a “work” trip in Marrakech or Essaouira.

When Arena told the diplomat her son Ugo Lemaire also planned to go to Morocco, Atmoun said he should reach out to “Uncle Atmoun” when he arrived. Later that year, Lemaire made a trip that was paid for by a company in Casablanca, according to a police report.

Seven months later, the secret services officers recorded Arena telling Panzeri how she had done a “speed vote” on an amendment to a parliamentary report that said Morocco exploits the resources of Western Sahara, a disputed territory south of the country where Rabat has waged a decades-long fight against a national liberation movement.

Arena and Panzeri visited Morocco together in 2015, a trip Arena says she used to push for the traceability of products from Western Sahara. According to Panzeri’s statements to the police, Atmoun paid for their stay in the five-star hotel La Mamounia in Marrakech without Arena’s knowledge.

The fresh revelations about Arena pile more questions on an investigation at risk of collapse. Lawyers for the official suspects have asked that the case be thrown out, arguing that prosecutors mishandled the investigation.

Michel Claise, the judge leading the inquiry stepped down in the summer after it was revealed that his son was in business with Arena’s son Lemaire.

So far, Arena continues to enjoy the support of her political allies. While Tarabella was suspended by his party after police raided his home, Arena remains a member.

Her S&D group put her forward — unsuccessfully, as it turned out — to be the EU’s chief observer of upcoming elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a trip that the EU later canceled.

“Our client wishes neither to comment nor react to the questions that seem biased and which are based on elements we do not have access to,” Arena’s lawyers wrote in an email to POLITICO, highlighting that she has not been accused as part of the ongoing investigation.

In their public statement, they said that if she were to be interviewed by police, “Arena proposes to give her point of view in public” if needed.",political

Priscilla Presley will record a clip talking about everything from Christmas shopping to Graceland for around $200.

These celebrities all use the video-sharing platform Cameo to quickly snap homemade videos for fans who pay them for the honor. They can be seen celebrating anniversaries, lightly roasting people, or offering advice. This summer, however, some videos have been weaponized by an unknown Russian group, which has crudely edited the clips and used them as part of its wide-ranging information warfare tactics against Ukraine.

At least seven seemingly unaware celebrities, including those listed above, have had their Cameo videos manipulated by pro-Russian actors to appear as if they are criticizing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, according to new Microsoft research published today. The altered Cameo videos were shared on social media then heavily reported on by Russian government-owned or controlled newspapers and TV channels, the research says.

The videos started appearing in July and follow similar patterns. “It's at a regular interval,” says Clint Watts, the general manager of Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, which published the research in an update on Russian information and cyber activities. “It's a different actor or actress popping up saying a very similar script,” Watts says.

The videos often see the celebrity talking to “Vladimir” and saying they should get help with possible substance abuse. The videos are later edited to appear as if the celebrity were addressing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky—the Kremlin has consistently pushed disinformation calling Zelensky an addict. The videos can have emoji, links, and social handles added to them before they are shared on social media.

The seven celebrities Microsoft highlights are actors Elijah Wood, John McGinley, Dean Norris, Kate Flannery, and Priscilla Presley; musician Shavo Odadjian; and boxer Mike Tyson. There is no suggestion that the celebrities knew their videos would be edited or manipulated in this way.",technology
"The US Food and Drug Administration today approved a first-of-its kind medical treatment that uses Crispr gene editing.

Called Casgevy, the therapy is intended to treat patients with sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that affects more than 100,000 people in the United States. The UK first approved the groundbreaking treatment on November 16. The therapy is made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Boston and Crispr Therapeutics of Switzerland.

The treatment aims to eliminate episodes of debilitating pain that are a hallmark of sickle cell disease. It involves editing patients’ cells outside the body to override the genetic defect that causes the disease. Adults and children 12 and older with frequent pain attacks will be eligible to receive it. The therapy is designed to be given just once, with benefits potentially lasting years or possibly decades.

“This is a major milestone,” says Vence Bonham, acting deputy director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health. “This could truly change the lives of individuals and reduce the burden of pain episodes.”

The FDA will decide by March 30 about whether the therapy should also be approved for beta thalassemia, a related blood disorder. The UK’s November approval included both sickle cell and beta thalassemia.

Sickle cell disease is a hereditary condition in which a person’s red blood cells are hard and crescent-shaped instead of flexible and round. These “sickled” cells clump together and block blood flow, causing bouts of extreme pain. Over time, the disease can cause organ damage. Sickled cells also die off early, leaving a shortage of healthy red blood cells. A low red blood cell count means the body can’t get enough oxygen, a condition called anemia. This causes fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. People with the disease have a life expectancy that’s more than two decades shorter than the rest of the US population.

“This is a terrible disease,” says Samarth Kulkarni, president and CEO of Crispr Therapeutics. “Every day feels like a big burden. Patients have this constant specter of mortality hanging over them.”

The culprit is abnormal hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen through the body. The problem arises from a mutation in the HBB gene. Everyone has two copies of the gene—one from each parent. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the mutated gene from both parents.",technology

Fixed and Known Issues

There were some issues that this BETA driver addressed, such as an issue with Counter-Strike 2 in DX11 mode, which would exhibit random flickering pixels when multisampling is set to 4x MSAA. Intel also fixes a crash issue with Alan Wake, Ghostrunner 2, and Far Cry 3 when starting a game. Cyberpunk 2077 is the only DX12 game on the list; Intel addresses colorful pixel corruption.

But Intel is still working on a Fortnite DX12 corruption issue with anti-aliasing settings and Dead by Daylight DX11 mode's crash during gameplay. Those who use Topaz Video AI with Arc series may face errors when using video enhancement. Iris Xe and Iris Xe Max-based notebooks may have trouble completing the installation process just like the last time.

It also inherits some of the long-running known issues with Intel Arc control, such as its studio capture mode creating multiple video files when used and when the display detects a DisplayPort connection when an HDMI output is used.

The Intel Arc Control has some known issues that have persisted for some time. One of these annoyances creates multiple video files when using the Studio Capture mode via the Arc Control. Another problem is when the display detects a DisplayPort connection when the HDMI output is used.

You can read more in Intel's release notes, and remember that these are non-WHQL drivers. Keeping that in mind, you can download the 31.0.101.5074 BETA driver from here.",technology
"A review of Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H has been published before the official launch on December 14, and the chip's performance is pretty mixed. Tested by Bilibili user Corbcas, their 155H-equipped laptop displayed impressive integrated GPU performance in 3DMark Time Spy but poor CPU performance in Cinebench R23.

As far as we know, the 155H is one of the faster, high-power Meteor Lake chips Intel has in the pipeline. Considering the Core Ultra 9 185H is the only higher-end CPU to have been leaked thus far, the 155H might even be the second-fastest H-class CPU Intel has for this generation, at least so far. So, the performance results are somewhat surprising on the CPU side.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel Core Ultra 7 155H Performance Row 0 - Cell 0 Core Ultra 7 155H Ryzen 7 7840HS Core i7-1360P Cinebench R23 Single Core 1,483 ~1,800* ~1,800* Cinebench R23 Multi Core 12,085 ~16,000* 10,095 Time Spy GPU 3,077 2,749 ~1,800*

*Scores are approximations

Comparing these benchmarks to data from our own testing, the official 3DMark rankings, and ballpark figures based on public data, it's not a great overall picture for the 155H. It did manage roughly a 20% higher multi-threaded score than the Core i7-1360P inside our Dell XPS 13 Plus, but it lost in the single-threaded test. It was beaten by a fair margin by AMD's competing Phoenix-based Ryzen 7 7840HS in both metrics.

However, things look much more positive in Time Spy. The 155H easily has the fastest integrated graphics out of the three chips, beating even the 780M graphics inside the 7840HS. That iGPU is the one that powers top-end gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally, so the 155H being faster is a pretty big deal. However, it did have four memory channels to help it out, and the 780M has just two channels.

Power consumption, however, was another point against the 155H, with roughly 40 watts used in both Cinebench R23 and Time Spy. The 7840HS and the 1360P consume roughly that amount, at least at peak performance, which means the 155H is somehow less efficient than even Intel's last-generation chip.

Of course, this pre-launch review isn't without significant caveats. For starters, we know very little about the testing conditions, including the model of the laptop, which tends to be pretty important. We don't even know if the power consumption figures given were the average or the maximum, which would be nice to know.

However, one interesting thing in the Time Spy results could tell us something useful: a CPU frequency over time chart. It looks like the 155H peaked at 4.5GHz just three times and, for the duration of the test, had a very inconsistent clock speed that dipped to as low as 3GHz or so at times. That could explain the middling CPU performance results, but since we can only see half of the graph, it's difficult to say for sure.

Realistically, it's hard to imagine Meteor Lake having worse CPU performance and efficiency than Raptor Lake, especially considering it uses a new microarchitecture and the latest Intel 4 process (formerly 7nm). Something is definitely strange with these results. If any data here is representative of Meteor Lake's actual performance, it might just be the Time Spy GPU score.",technology
"Transcript

Hi, I'm Janna Levin.

I'm a Professor of Physics and Astronomy

at Barnard College of Columbia University.

And today I've been asked to explain black holes

in five levels of increasing complexity.

A black hole might be different than you imagine.

To some extent it's a place and not a thing.

Black holes play an important role

in the history of the universe,

in sculpting galaxies that we live in,

and possibly in the ultimate fate of the universe.

[tense music]

Hi.

Hi, welcome.

Tell me your name.

Jude.

I wanted to ask you

if you have ever heard of a black hole?

Yeah, I think that they're scary and cool.

'Cause you can get sucked in and get lost forever

and get plopped out in a random place.

It's like a big, giant, black thingy.

So black holes, you describe them as huge.

The interesting thing about black holes

is they're hugely heavy,

but they're actually physically really small.

What really matters is the density.

Do you know what density is?

It's not weight, but it's how much of it is in it.

Here, let me show you something.

I can ask how heavy it is. Yeah.

I can also ask how big it is,

which is a question about its volume.

If I make it smaller,

then what's happening is it's becoming more dense.

So imagine I crushed this really, really small.

It would weigh the same, it would have the same mass,

but it would be much more dense.

How does it go that small?

If a star is heavy enough to explode into supernova

what's left begins to collapse under its own weight.

And if that's heavy enough,

the core will not be able to stop collapsing,

'cause it no longer has the thermonuclear fuel,

it's run outta fuel.

And if it's run outta fuel,

it's no longer shining and pushing outward.

And without that it itself begins to go dark

and there's nothing fighting the collapse anymore.

And that's when you form a black hole.

So if like the sun all collapsed on itself,

it would form a black hole?

Well, that's a really good question.

So interestingly, the sun itself isn't heavy enough.

So it has to be heavy enough

that when it begins to collapse,

it just overcomes all attempts to fight it.

If you made something really dense,

you would have to travel faster than the speed of light

to actually escape.

That's 300,000 kilometers per second.

So it goes so fast that there's it's all dark?

So it goes so fast that it goes completely dark.

Any light that veers too close will fall in,

will not be able to make it back out again.

If a light is shining from the sun near a black hole,

the black hole's not touching it.

Why does the light get pulled in?

Why does that happen?

Because the black hole is taking other stuff?

It is taking other stuff,

but the funny question was like,

if I wanted to move your chair,

you'd think it was really strange

if I didn't have to come near you

and actually grab the chair and move it.

One of the things Einstein thought about

is he imagined that

what the black hole is doing

is it's changing the shape of space around it.

What do you think of that idea?

It's crazy.

Isn't it crazy?

And then Einstein goes a step further

and thinks, well, what black holes must be doing

is curving the space so strongly

that even light gets caught.

Sometimes you can get light caught into a whole orbit,

literally the light going round and round in an orbit.

So black hole, it doesn't attract light,

it moves the space so that the curve is pointed towards it?

That's right.

We've been talking for a little while about black holes.

What are you gonna walk away with

in your impression of what a black hole is?

It's kind of curves in space

that are all coming to one point.

Everything that goes on those curves

changes directions to come in

and even light can't escape it, nothing can.

You said that very beautifully.

Does that feel like a different idea of a black hole

than the one you had before we spoke?

Yeah, a lot.

[midtempo music]

Have you heard about black holes?

Yes, I know it has a lot of mass, but it's very small.

I know that there are several theories about the universe

due to black holes,

like, around the universe and how it's made.

So a lot of times stars are born together

in two star systems

and when they die, if they're heavy enough,

they will collapse under their own weight

and form a black hole.

So here you have a black hole and a big fluffy star.

And what will happen is

it'll start to tear apart its neighboring star.

Literally parts of the star

will begin to spill onto the black hole

and splatter on the black hole.

But let's say both those stars formed black holes.

And what these black holes do

is they are like mallets on a drum.

They create literally waves

in the shape of spacetime as they're moving.

So imagine mallets on a drum,

how the drum ripples.

Depending on how the mallets are moving

you hear different sounds.

So effectively these black holes,

as they get very close together

in the final stages of their life together,

they're orbiting each other at hundreds of times a second.

It's this really crazy event,

but it's happening in complete darkness.

Eventually they bobble together and they merge

and then they wring out,

the spacetime's going crazy around them,

it's this storm in spacetime,

and they settle down to a quiet black hole.

Then those waves that they created

travel through the universe, basically undisturbed.

For a long time people thought,

well, even if black holes are out there,

they're impossible to observe.

And then they got very clever.

You might wonder how we could possibly hear black holes,

that sounds crazy.

So I'm gonna show you, but I'm gonna need your help.

This demo involves an electric guitar.

Do you play at all? A little bit?

Okay, you wanna do the demo for me?

So the LIGO instrument electronically records

the ringing of the shape of space

with its very complicated instrument.

It stands for

Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Waves Observatory

and the design was incredibly difficult

and they didn't know if they would succeed.

I think of the instrument

as like the body of the electric guitar.

And then they take the readout

of the motions of the waves that they're recording,

just like that guitar

is recording the motions of the waves on the string.

Now just play it like a little bit.

And you can't hear anything, right?

You're not meant to hear an electric guitar

when it's not plugged in.

What's happening is the guitar strings are ringing,

but so quietly that we can't actually hear the sound.

And this is like the gravitational waves,

which are ringing the drum of spacetime,

but so quietly that they're not move the air

and we're not hearing them.

So now play and I'm gonna turn the volume up a little bit.

[electric guitar music]

While I can't actually hear

the ringing of the strings themselves,

I can hear the data of the shape of the string

recorded and played through this amplifier.

And that's kind of the idea behind the LIGO instrument.

How do you know that it's

like the black hole that's making this sound

and nothing else?

It's a great question.

If I didn't see you playing the guitar,

I would recognize the sound of a guitar.

And even if I had never heard of a guitar before

I could figure out the frequencies

that the string was playing,

I could tell how strongly it had been plucked,

and I could tell the length of it

and where it was pinned down

from the harmonics of the string.

And I can tell the different lengths of the strings

from the notes that they play.

So I can actually

reconstruct the instrument that's playing it.

And it's very similar to LIGO,

we can listen to the notes, the amplitude, the harmonics,

and we can deduce the size

and shape of the objects doing that.

And they're very massive and they're very small

and they have all the markings of a black hole.

Is there anything that like,

gets affected on Earth because of those waves?

It's a really good question.

Only this instrument,

and that's why it was so hard to build.

And by the time it gets here, it's so weak

that it's only squeezing and stretching space

at like the fraction of a nucleus over very large distances.

Has your understanding of black holes changed

over the course of our conversation?

I knew there were waves for like everything,

but I never thought specifically,

oh yeah, black holes have, like, waves.

I know more and less.

I know what you mean.

[gentle music]

I'm Jayda, It's nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, and where are you studying?

I'm a senior at NYU.

I'm studying physics and environmental studies.

What is your impression of what a black hole is?

So it's a star that has collapsed.

It has so much concentrated mass and gravity

that there's a point outside of the black hole

called the event horizon.

So once you get past the event horizon,

nothing, not even light can escape from that.

So that's a great definition

and I wanna pick that apart a little bit.

So what you described is just right.

Stars, when they run out of thermonuclear fuel

are gonna collapse under their own weight.

It'll explode in a supernova, it'll leave a core,

and if the core itself is heavy enough,

it will keep collapsing.

It does, as you say, reach this point

where not even light can escape.

But the amazing thing is it leaves that point,

you called it rightly the event horizon,

it leaves it behind kind of like an archeological record

because the start itself

can no more sit at the event horizon

than it can race outward at the speed of light.

So the core of the star keeps collapsing

and where it goes nobody knows.

So in a weird way,

the black hole isn't anymore a crush of matter.

It left it behind in its wake,

but the stuff of the star is gone.

I've heard of Schwarzschild black holes,

which is a black hole that is static,

a Kerr black hole or a Kerr-Newman black hole,

which is a black hole that rotates,

but what makes a black hole static versus rotating?

And what's more common?

It turns out that there are only three quantities

that define a black hole,

its electric charge, its mass, and its spin.

So the most general black hole can also spin

and it can also be electrically charged.

Whether or not they are has to do with how they formed.

If a star collapses,

it will likely be spinning when it collapses

and the remnant black hole that forms

will likely be spinning.

A black hole of a certain mass, charge, and spin

is indistinguishable from any other black hole

with those same properties.

So in some sense, they're like fundamental particles,

which makes them absolutely exceptional

for any other astrophysical object.

Have you heard the stories about what happens

inside a black hole?

I remember that once you pass the event horizon

space becomes time and time becomes space,

in like, a coordinate sense.

So from the outside, if you're an astronaut,

you're watching your friend,

another astronaut going into the black hole,

it's as though your times become rotated

relative to each other.

So the profound thing is as an astronaut on the outside,

looking at this round event horizon,

you think of the center of black hole as a point in space,

but to the person who's fallen in,

it's not a point in space at all, it's a point in time.

The singularity, or the end of it all,

the crush in the center of a black hole

is in their future.

So they can no more avoid the singularity

than you can avoid the next instant of time coming.

So the death in the singularity is inevitable.

Although we don't really think

the singularity necessarily exists.

I sort of know what a singularity is.

I think of it as something

where everything is compacted into one single point,

it's a place where the laws of physics

don't exactly work out.

What did you mean when you said

that you don't think the singularity really exists?

So the singularity is definitely predicted

in Einstein's general theory of relativity

and that's purely a theory of spacetime.

And in the theory of spacetime,

there is no question that a singularity would form

when the star collapses catastrophically

inside the black hole.

Now, even when people talked about singularities

back in the '60s, they thought, you know, quantum mechanics

is part of the story of the whole of physics.

It's not just gravity.

And if we understand quantum gravity

we'll realize that singularity

probably doesn't ever actually form.

So since we obviously have never been to a black hole,

how do we know for sure,

like, what happens after you cross the event horizon

or what happens inside a black hole?

Is it just like, inferred from the math?

I would say to some extent we don't know for sure.

What we have found is that

the mathematics is so unbelievably powerful

that we're able to disprove wrong ideas

just in pen and paper.

Just very recently, within the past couple of years,

the first ever human-procured image of a black hole

showed us what we expected to see of the event horizon.

So Jayda, after our conversation today,

what would you say a black hole is?

Something that I had never thought of before is

a black hole as kind of

a type of quantum fundamental particle.

I've also learned how event horizon of a black hole

kind of hides a singularity.

The beauty of being a student

of something like black holes

is you never stop

having new impressions of what this enigmatic phenomena is.

So in a year, I'll tell you what I learned that's new.

Awesome!

[classical music]

I'm Clare.

And you're in graduate school

and you're getting your PhD.

What year are you?

I'm a second year.

So I'm measuring star formation histories

in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.

Does the Large Magellanic Cloud have a big black hole?

So, I think the prevailing wisdom for a while was no,

but my answer honestly is I'm not sure.

Yeah, and probably nobody is. [women laughing]

Have you heard a lot in your studies

about these super massive black holes

that we think lurk in the centers

of very nearly every galaxy?

So I don't study AGN a lot,

but I do have a long term interest in black holes,

it's one of the reasons I entered the field.

I always was curious about

how a black hole of that size was able to form.

Was it the result of mergers between smaller black holes,

ultimately creating gravitational well deep enough

to contract a protogenic disc for a whole galaxy?

Or, man, what happened?

Yeah, I think it's a really good question.

The only mechanism that we know for sure

can form black holes is to collapse of very massive stars.

So it's sensible to think,

well maybe some very massive stars in a young universe

collapsed under their own weight and then they merged

and after some time they got big enough,

but the black holes from stars

can be tens of times the mass of the sun,

maybe hundreds of times to the mass of the sun

if they merge.

To get to millions and billions,

and if you just do the simple arithmetic

of how many years that would take,

there aren't enough years

in the 14 billion years of the universe's lifetime.

So they must have come from somewhere else.

I am at a loss

to think of what could have possibly happened

in between the start of the universe

and the formation of our galaxy

that could create such a massive object.

Yeah, I think that's right.

I think people are really perplexed

about how you make something so big

in such a short period of time.

It's kind of funny, the bigger you make a black hole,

it seems maybe counterintuitive,

but the less dense the material has to be

out of which you make it.

So you can, out of something the density almost of air,

you can make a supermassive black hole.

You can't make a star out of that,

but weirdly, if you skip the star phase altogether,

it's conceivable that they directly collapse.

And so there's suddenly a new way to make black holes

that nature has figured out.

We spend all of our time,

when we learn about black holes in school,

predominantly through star collapse.

[Janna] Yeah.

I didn't even realize that there

was an alternate route to creating a black hole.

There might be many alternate routes.

It might be in the very early universe

that bubbles in unusual phase transitions

from very high energy universe to a low energy universe

can make black holes.

Like, we haven't really thought of

the range of possibilities.

And so there could also be primordial black holes

that are still around

that also skipped the star stage altogether

that were formed really in the very earliest phases.

And I think the interesting thing is,

with your looking at like the Large Magellanic Cloud,

is to wonder if we're gonna merge.

Absolutely.

We thought the canonical picture of the Clouds

was essentially that they had formed with the Milky Way,

maybe in its halo,

and had been in a stable orbit for about a Hubble time,

or about 14 billion years.

Young guns in the field have thrown a wrench in that theory

that they've always been orbiting

and that perhaps they're on their first orbit,

they're on an unstable orbit.

Will they join us?

Can you tell us about Andromeda?

Andromeda is part of the big three in the local group.

The local group being a group of galaxies

that are not expanding

with the expansion of the universe away from each other,

they're trapped.

Gravitationally, all friends.

Yes, they're all friends.

And Andromeda is one of the few galaxies

that is traveling towards us

and do for a merger event at some point.

So given a sufficiently low velocity,

we would just have two big galaxies that,

for the most part,

pass through each other, pass by each other.

But given a sufficiently high velocity,

we will have some crazy black hole interactions

and some crazy star interactions.

But when we do merge with Andromeda,

presumably our black holes will merge

and Andromeda indeed has

a very big black hole as well at its center.

And then we'll have this just gigantic-

Supermassive black hole.

Yeah, and it's very possible that as you said,

the collision won't be so severe

that it'll be very disruptive.

So our entire solar system could stay intact

and here we would go with the sun and all the other planets

in orbit around a new black hole.

They're kind of misunderstood giants in a way.

So I was curious,

have you heard anything new or interesting

in the field of black holes

that will shape future discussions?

We work a lot right now

on thinking of black holes as batteries.

So a black hole that can take, like a giant magnet,

astronomical magnet in the form of another collapsed star,

like a neutron star,

and flip it around so fast, near the speed of light,

that it actually creates an electronic circuit

out of this moving magnet.

And so that the power

that can come out of these electronic circuits

created by these batteries can be tremendous.

You know, I know that at a certain point

for our civilization to become sufficiently advanced,

to travel the cosmos beyond, you know, the moon or Mars,

we may have to be able to harness the power of our sun.

Would it be similarly possible to harness

the power of a black hole like you were mentioning,

to travel?

It's a great question.

I once did a calculation of

using a black hole made out of the moon

and the strongest magnet we could find on Earth

to see if I could make an electronic battery.

And honestly,

you only get about enough energy to power New York City.

But we have to find one in our neighborhood first.

Yeah, wouldn't be my favorite thing.

So Claire,

we've had this pretty fascinating conversation

about supermassive black holes in particular.

And after our discussion,

what is it that has changed for you in your perspective

or what is it that excites you?

Oh, I think our discussion kind of

exposed a piece of black holes that I don't think of often,

which is that they're not just life takers,

they're life givers.

And they inform a lot about,

not just how a galaxy is destroyed or made,

but how it's shaped and how it eventually, you know,

builds life like ours.

So maybe I have to give black holes a little bit more props.

[gentle music]

Hi, Dan, I'm so glad you could make it.

What have you been working on with black holes

in the time since I've last seen you?

There are a lot of aspects to black holes.

The one that's kind of interested me most lately

is trying to understand them

from the point of view of information,

how information is stored and processed

and recovered from black holes.

Which turns out to be a really interesting perspective.

Talk us through Hawking's initial revolution

that led to a lot of these conversations

about the information around black holes.

Hawking's big insight was that

he had to apply both the rules of quantum mechanics

and the rules of gravity

to really understand how black holes behaved.

But Hawking took a point of view

where he brought quantum mechanics into the game.

He really that if you took that into account,

that it's actually not quite true

that black holes are black,

that actually things can escape from black holes.

So what you're describing is the famous Hawking radiation

where a black hole cleverly kind of steals energy

from the quantum vacuum

and radiates and in the process of evaporates.

And of course this caused a big kerfuffle

because when the black hole evaporates,

eventually that event horizons is yanked up.

And the question is, where did everything go

that had once fallen in?

A way to think about Hawking radiation

is to imagine that pairs of particles and antiparticles

appear out of the quantum vacuum

and the particle can escape the black hole,

but the antiparticle falls in.

But the particle and antiparticle are a pair

and if the antiparticle really falls into the black hole

and is destroyed at the singularity,

that poor particle outside the black hole

has lost his partner.

It also violates the rules of quantum mechanics.

If you have two particles that are entangled,

that has to be preserved.

Now, to be clear,

nobody disputes that black holes will quantum radiate,

that Hawking radiation is a solid prediction.

The black holes should in fact evaporate,

that's not disputed, right?

That's right.

It would be wonderful if we could have

some experimental of evidence for this,

if we could really build a black hole in the lab

and test to see whether it behaves this way.

But I think there is hope

that we'll be able to detect some of these effects

either indirectly,

by looking at black holes out in the universe,

or also maybe indirectly in the laboratory

by looking at systems which aren't black holes,

but which radiate in kind of similar ways.

There's this domain of black holes in astrophysics

where we see stars collapse,

and we know that they exist

and there's whole observational astronomy around them.

And then there's this domain that we're talking about,

where, as you said, black holes are so special

because they're kind of guiding us in the right direction

to understand the very nature of reality.

And that makes them really unusually special.

And one of the things I wanted to draw out is that

we talk about the fundamental forces of nature.

So there's the matter forces,

and then the outlier is gravity.

We've quantized all the matter forces

in a way that we're rather comfortable with.

Gravity keeps resisting quantization of gravity itself.

And now we're thinking in a way that you're describing

that, well, maybe it's only the quantum forces altogether.

The pursuit of quantum gravity

has taken us to places we never expected to be.

I think what's exciting about physics,

about theoretical physics,

that you start following a thread,

you start developing a chain of logic,

and you never know where it's gonna end up.

Do you think there's ever a hope that

the kind of information that you think about,

the quantum gravity aspects of the universe

that you think about,

whether it will pan out or not,

will ever be viably observed

in these astronomical pursuits of the event horizon?

It's a real challenge, but astronomical observations

have gotten so fantastically precise.

And there is some hope that if you looked at things

like two black holes merging,

each black hole comes in with its own event horizon,

but then when the black holes merge,

there's a very complicated process

where these two event horizons merge

and oscillate and vibrate,

and then settle down into a single event horizon

for the final black hole.

There is some hope that if we can make

sufficiently detailed observations of this process,

if we could really see

the way the event horizon is behaving

as it settles down to this final state,

that maybe that could reveal

some of these quantum effects that we've been talking about.

It is amazing in the numerical simulations

of two black holes merging,

you really see the event horizons bobble around.

And we were talking earlier about how

really black holes are flawless,

they don't tolerate those kinds of imperfections.

And so you can so quickly watch the system wring away

that misshapen merger.

And it comes out in the gravitational waves,

which is literally the ripples in the shape of spacetime

until it settles down,

and then it's utterly flawless again.

It really happens fast.

It's quite amazing.

Yeah, it's a spectacular process.

In some sense, black holes aren't anything anymore.

They're just empty, curved spacetimes and nothing is there.

How would you possibly make one?

And then it becomes,

why are there so many

and where are they all?

Being a black hole scientist means

each question leads to more questions.

We know more and more,

but we also see how much more there is to understand.

I hope you've learned something about black holes.

"It appears that Beeper Mini, an easy iMessage solution for Android, was simply too good to be true — or a short-lived dream, at least. On Friday, less than a week after its launch, the app started experiencing technical issues when users were suddenly unable to send and receive blue bubble messages. The problems grew worse over the course of the day, with reports piling up on the Beeper subreddit. Several people at The Verge were unable to activate their Android phone numbers with Beeper Mini as of Friday afternoon, a clear indication that Apple has plugged up whatever holes allowed the app to operate to begin with.

Beeper Mini was the result of a comprehensive attempt to reverse engineer Apple’s messaging protocol. A 16-year-old high school student managed to successfully pull it off, and for a while, everything worked without a hitch. That effort became the basis for the new app, which requires a $2 / month subscription. Here’s what my colleague Jake wrote days ago:

Its developers figured out how to register a phone number with iMessage, send messages directly to Apple’s servers, and have messages sent back to your phone natively inside the app. It was a tricky process that involved deconstructing Apple’s messaging pipeline from start to finish. Beeper’s team had to figure out where to send the messages, what the messages needed to look like, and how to pull them back down from the cloud. The hardest part, Migicovsky said, was cracking what is essentially Apple’s padlock on the whole system: a check to see whether the connected device is a genuine Apple product.

Quinn Nelson, of Snazzy Labs, also made an excellent video that covers the technical details. The belief — or I suppose the hope — among Beeper’s developers and users was that it would be such an ordeal for Apple to block the Android app that doing so wouldn’t be worth the hassle. Apparently, it was easier than anyone expected.

This throws a huge wrench into Beeper’s plans; the company was hoping to evolve Beeper Mini into an all-in-one messaging app that would eventually wrap in RCS and SMS.

Reached for comment, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky did not deny that Apple has successfully blocked Beeper Mini. “If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is... if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, rather than using unsecure SMS? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?”",technology

Shams Charania, NBA basketball reporter Source: Sinclair Broadcast Group's Stadium

Shams Charania's primary job is straightforward: break news on the National Basketball Association. It's not a new occupation, but historically it's never been a particularly lucrative one. Social media and legalized mobile sports betting have changed the game. Being the first to tweet out news of a trade, free agent signing, injury or executive change has become a kind of esport of its own, with the information reaching millions of followers in an instant. NBA fans on Twitter are on a first-name basis with Charania and are equally intimate with his former Yahoo Sports colleague Adrian Wojnarowski, known as Woj, who now writes for ESPN . During the NBA offseason or as trade deadline approaches and players change teams at lightning speed, one of the two reporters will almost always break the news. The comments on their tweets come in by the thousands, and the public is keeping score. Wojnarowski's scoops even have their own moniker: ""Woj bomb."" Fans with too much time on their hands will post videos of a superimposed Wojnarowski dunking on Charania, or vice versa. Charania said he tries not to pay attention to the comments. ""I just have such blinders on,"" Charania told CNBC in an interview this week. ""I try to have tunnel vision, so every single day all I can focus on is my job."" While sports broadcasting personalities such as Craig Kilborn, Keith Olbermann, Bill Simmons and Robin Roberts have made millions of dollars by leaning on their charisma and developing popular TV shows, radio programs and podcasts, seven-figure salaries haven't historically been handed out to breaking-news reporters. But Charania, Wojnarowski and ESPN NFL reporter Adam Schefter are now the hottest commodities in sports journalism, and they're all due for big-time paydays. Each reporter's contract ends in 2022, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because of confidentiality. Wojnarowski and Schefter reportedly make $2 million to $3 million a year already at ESPN. Both declined to comment for this story. Charania declined to comment on details of his contract. The race is on to figure out who will be on the move and where they'll all end up.

Millions of followers

The interest stems from their towering social media presence. Charania has 1.4 million Twitter followers, Wojnarowski has 5 million, and Schefter has a whopping 8.9 million followers. Some 3 million people follow Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network.

Captive audiences have major value. Gambling companies, which count on a growing customer base to expand their businesses, are reportedly salivating at the idea of hiring major media names, even if it costs them millions of dollars to do so. Caesars Sportsbook has already lured former ESPN personalities Kenny Mayne and Trey Wingo to create and distribute sports betting content. But those guys aren't breaking-news reporters. Finding out information first and tweeting it to massive audiences is a very different skill. It's almost mechanical. The value is in the speed and accuracy, while opinions and humor can get in the way or distort the information. ""When you have legal gambling, all information is important, and so is the timing of its release,"" said Bryan Curtis, editor-at-large at The Ringer, who has tracked sports media for decades. ""News breakers will continue to gain more power versus the rest of us, to the extent that's humanly possible."" Charania's rise to fame has been particularly striking because he's only 27. Almost a decade ago, while studying at Loyola University Chicago, Charania started digging into NBA news. He got a job writing for a small basketball blog called RealGM. As a freshman, Charania began making relationships with fringe Chicago Bulls players and breaking smaller stories about players signing 10-day contracts. When the Bulls denied Charania game credentials because he was still in college, the cub reporter began driving up to Milwaukee. The Bucks were in a smaller media market and let him cover the team daily. In 2014, while a sophomore at Loyola, Charania scored his first big scoop. He reported that then-Bulls forward Luol Deng had been traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for former all-star center Andrew Bynum and draft picks. ""I was definitely pumped, heart racing,"" Charania said. ""It was exhilarating. Still is."" Charania's initial tweet elicited congratulatory comments from a litany of senior sports writers. Wojnarowski called him ""the best young reporter in the business."" A year later, he got a job reporting for Yahoo with Wojnarowski as he continued his studies. He soon started to build a reputation by breaking news on larger deals. In 2018, a year after Wojnarowski left Yahoo for ESPN, Charania joined The Athletic and Sinclair Broadcast Group's Stadium.

Monetizing breaking news

When millions of fans are glued to your every tweet, there's tremendous pressure to be right above all else. One significant error can destroy your credibility, especially from those wagering money on the information. ""It has to be accurate and truthful information at all times,"" said Charania. ""If I am doing anything other than that, then I feel like I'm failing everyone."" By everyone, Charania means not just people but corporate sponsors as well. Charania is now appearing in an AT&T 5G advertisement that emphasizes the network's speed and reliability, the traits most important to his success. It's part of a season-long partnership between AT&T, Stadium and Charania. T-Mobile ran a similar campaign with Wojnarowski and Schefter in 2018, and Samsung followed with a TV spot featuring the two ESPN reporters. The job is a grind. A lunch meeting with Charania means a constant series of five-minute interruptions from a stream of texts and calls, said Chris Reina, Charania's former editor at RealGM.

""I guess Woj has kids, but I don't know how anyone does this job with kids and family obligations,"" Reina said. The rise of the sports breaking-news journalist underscores the increased importance of data and information in the 24/7 digital world, compared with prior eras, when talking heads ruled TV news. The Ringer's Curtis attributes the change to fantasy sports, Twitter and ""nationalized sports fandom."" He said ""legalized gambling will complete the process."" The Athletic's $550 million sale to The New York Times last week is the latest chapter in the story. The Times wants to incorporate The Athletic's data-driven analysis. The Athletic's focus has been print journalism and podcasts, rather than video, which has historically commanded greater value due to higher ad rates. As traditional pay TV loses millions of subscribers each year and younger consumers turn to social media rather than cable, breaking news via Twitter and other social channels will only grow in importance. ""The world we live in now is totally different than it was five, six, seven, eight years ago,"" said Charania. ""Social media is how we're able to reach people. Because of Twitter, people were able to see my work and be able to identify with me, and I was able to gain an audience base. I'm lucky to be able to do this job now.""

"Copper, a tan-and-brown mixed-breed, spent October fighting for his life. The Missouri dog first got sick on October 7, a light cough quickly progressing into a wet hacking one, loss of appetite, and lowered blood oxygen levels. When antibiotics didn’t help, he was admitted to the ICU at his local veterinary hospital.

Copper spent a week in isolation, receiving oxygen support, IV fluids, and antibiotics. Even after returning home, with more antibiotics and an oxygen concentrator to use when he struggled to breath, Copper wasn’t out of the woods. He had to be rushed back to the hospital at one point for another night on oxygen support, and only now is he steadily improving back at home. “We felt close to losing him a few times,” Copper’s owner Kevin Mahoney says.

Over the past few months, the mysterious respiratory illness that almost cost Copper his life has been sickening dogs across the US. Veterinarians don’t know what’s causing it—yet.

Things have been worst in Oregon. The state’s Department of Agriculture began receiving reports of unusual canine respiratory infections back in August. To date, over 200 dogs with a similar illness have been reported in the state, and similar cases have appeared in multiple other states. The disease presents similarly to a bacterial condition known as kennel cough, though symptoms tend to be more severe, last many times longer, and aren’t responsive to the common antibiotics used to treat this known illness. In some cases, the new disease has been fatal.

David Needle, senior veterinary pathologist at the University of New Hampshire, has a lead on what the culprit might be; he thinks it may have been stalking canines for some time. In 2022, Needle’s team began looking at nasal and oral swabs taken from sick dogs in New England, in cases where no known cause of disease was found and the dogs weren’t responsive to treatment. They found a small DNA sequence of a potential disease-causing microbe in 21 of the initial 30 animal samples screened.

Now, in the most recent outbreak, they are screening dogs with long-standing coughs and sneezes from other states that have tested negative for known respiratory diseases—including some dogs from Oregon—to hunt for the same fragment. It’s present in some of the dogs currently sick, suggesting to Needle that the DNA is associated with the emerging illness somehow, but more testing is needed to confirm that the DNA does in fact belong to a pathogen, and what it is. Needle is certain it isn’t a virus—too many genes are present. His best guess is that it’s from an unfamiliar bacteria.

“The thing we found … it seems like it would be something that is really host-adapted and has evolved along with its host for a very long time—like thousands and thousands of years,” Needle says. This understanding is based on the type of bacteria the DNA appears to be from, and how the fragment compares to the genome of the most closely related bacteria, which are highly host-adapted. Furthering this belief is that this suspected bacteria is “not popping up in other animals or people now.” He theorizes that, having long coexisted with dogs, the potential pathogen at some point evolved the ability to cause disease, “either by mutating or acquiring a gene from another bacteria.” He stresses that as what they’ve found is not a previously studied type of bacteria, there is a lot to learn before any concrete answers are available.",technology
"When she considers how far she’s come, Dr. Paula Johnson sees the path that brought her from being a public school kid in Brooklyn to being the first Black woman president of Wellesley College and a tireless advocate for equity in medicine. It’s a path that refined her life’s work into a simple question: “How do we improve the health and well being of all women, particularly those who suffer the most inequity?”

It started with her grandmother, even though she didn’t realize it at the time.

“My grandmother’s psychiatric illness through a good part of my childhood was, when I look back, a motivating force,” Dr. Johnson says. Motivate it has: She is a member of the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She founded the Mary Horrigan Connors Center for Women’s Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and she has received several honorary doctorates and awards for her lifetime of work.

But before all of that, her family struggled for years to get her grandmother the medical help she needed, and that experience turned out to be the first step of a journey that would eventually make her a force for women’s health. Dr. Johnson left Brooklyn and went to Radcliffe College at Harvard University, following her interest in science toward the field of medicine. While in college, she happened to take a small seminar course taught by Ruth Hubbard, the first woman to be tenured in the biology department at Harvard.

“She was a remarkable trailblazer,” Dr. Johnson recalls. “She had moved away from her basic science and started teaching more about some of the societal and social issues having to do with biology, and she taught a course called Biology and Women’s Issues. It was transformational in a number of ways.”

Dr. Johnson says that the class opened her eyes to the ways that science could be biased, not only in the identity of the scientists doing the research but also in the studies themselves. The construct was overwhelmingly a male one; men were the ones doing the studies, men were the ones used as subjects for the studies, and women were largely ignored despite making up half the human population. The connection between what she was learning and what her grandmother had been through was clear.",technology

"“All of this confusion is revealing that Dobbs is not itself workable,” said Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, referring to the case that overturned Roe. “Dobbs is premised on the distinction between elective and therapeutic abortions, that … you can ban one while protecting the other. We’re learning in real time that that’s not possible.”

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old Dallas-area mother of two who is about 20 weeks pregnant, was recently informed by her medical team that her fetus has the likely fatal condition Trisomy 18 and that continuing the pregnancy would put her at high risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes and infection. But her doctors, afraid of prosecution or losing their medical licenses under the state’s near-total ban, said they would not provide an abortion until the fetus died.

Cox took the case to court, and a state judge ruled Thursday that she could obtain an abortion and that the doctor performing it could not be criminally charged. Hours later, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned Cox’s doctor and the hospitals where she practices that they could still be prosecuted if they go forward with the procedure. The court injunction, he argued, only blocks his office from bringing criminal charges, but doesn’t prohibit local prosecutors from doing so or stop state residents from filing civil charges.

Paxton added that with the state expected to appeal the ruling, the physicians won’t be protected from criminal charges should the lower court order be overturned.

“The [temporary restraining order] will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires,” he warned.

Democrats have since seized on the case and Paxton’s decision to intervene and appeal it to the state’s supreme court, believing it highlights two of their central arguments: women’s rights are in jeopardy under a GOP-controlled government and the system of checks and balances is under attack.

Biden officials focused on reproductive rights have been monitoring Cox’s case. But Paxton’s threat Thursday elevated the issue among those in President Joe Biden’s orbit, alarming allies who saw it as a direct attack on Cox and her doctors in defiance of a court order. The move also raised concerns that it could further confuse a medical establishment still struggling to manage the fallout of last year’s Dobbs decision.

Biden’s reelection campaign plans to argue the case is a prime example of the existential threat posed to women’s reproductive rights if Republicans return to power in 2024.

“Ken Paxton is doing a great job of expressing for thousands of women in Texas the horror of having the state in charge of your pregnancy,” said Cecile Richards, the former CEO of Planned Parenthood and current co-chair of Democratic Super PAC American Bridge 21st Century. “These are people’s lives that are at stake, and it’s only going to get worse.”

The campaign on Friday repeatedly highlighted coverage of Paxton’s statement. It also sought to use the legal standoff to target GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, portraying the case as a direct result of the former president’s actions — from appointing three justices to the Supreme Court to backing policies aimed at limiting reproductive rights.

“This story is shocking, it’s horrifying, and it’s heartbreaking — it’s also becoming all too commonplace in America because of Donald Trump,” Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), a Biden campaign co-chair, said in a statement. “The American people should know that Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans won’t stop here.”

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Doctors have warned since the fall of Roe last year that vague and unscientific language in state abortion bans leaves them unsure of when they’re able to intervene, even when patients have life-threatening complications.

Texas’ ban, for instance, has no exemptions for rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies, but allows abortions to take place when the patient is “in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”

Donley said that uncertainty about what that means — coupled with the threat of incarceration, bankruptcy and the end of their careers — is having a chilling effect on doctors.

“Think of all the words in there: What is ‘serious’? What is a ‘substantial impairment’? What is a ‘major bodily function’? Every one of those terms is a pressure point, subject to interpretation,” she said. “It’s understandable that hospitals are interpreting those exemptions in the most narrow way possible to protect themselves.”

Anti-abortion groups in Texas are rallying behind Paxton and characterizing Cox’s lawsuit as an attempt to undermine and ultimately get rid of the state’s ban. Both Texas Alliance for Life and Texas Right to Life told POLITICO they are unconvinced that Cox qualifies for a medical exemption and said she should carry the pregnancy to term even if the baby does not survive.

“When a child is aborted, they’re robbed of any length of life they might have had, and the family is robbed of the chance to hold and grieve that child. That is not the compassionate option for that family or child,” Amy O’Donnell, the spokesperson for Texas Alliance for Life, said in an interview.

John Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life, said he agrees with critics of the ban that its exemptions aren’t “speaking the exact language doctors do.” But he argued it’s the responsibility of the state’s medical board and private medical associations to educate doctors about when to apply those exemptions.

“They have failed in their job to explain to doctors and hospital ethics committees and attorneys what the law is,” he said. “Medical associations need to do their job and educate physicians on the front lines.”

Both Cox’s case and another filed Friday in Kentucky by an anonymous pregnant woman represent a new chapter in the legal battles over abortion post-Roe. Until now, most cases have been brought by doctors and advocacy groups challenging bans on behalf of their pregnant patients, because pregnancy and abortion are so medically precarious and time-sensitive compared to the slow pace of court proceedings.

GOP officials have argued in court in Texas, Kentucky and other states that those doctors and groups have no standing because they aren’t the ones harmed if a pregnancy continues, and interests aren’t always aligned between doctors and patients. Now that pregnant people are filing challenges, it will test who, if anyone, conservative-leaning judges allow to bring a lawsuit.

“There must be a way into the courthouse doors,” said Brigitte Amiri, the deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project who is working on the Kentucky case. “They can’t say there’s no third-party standing for doctors, then say we can’t have a pregnant person bringing this case for other reasons. You have to allow citizens to challenge laws.”

Cox’s legal team stressed that it’s not feasible for most people in her situation — or most people seeking an abortion in general — to have the time, courage and resources to bring legal challenges.

“Health care doesn’t work this way,” said Molly Duane, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “I certainly wouldn’t want my doctors waiting around for a court to decide whether or not she could save my life.”",political

I'm about to play Stockfish 16,

the strongest chess computer in the world.

And we are going to see how long I can survive.

What?

What the [beep] is that? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not fine.

Queen takes Bishop, Checkmate.

That was horrible.

I never want to do that again. I got Checkmated in 34 moves.

The most important thing is I had a lot of fun. No I didn't.

My name is Levy Rozman.

I wanna find out a little bit more about

how Stockfish thinks so I can use its tricks

to beat other humans.

Today we'll talk to Gary Linscott, software engineer

who has worked in computer chess for over 20 years.

So Gary, you worked on Stockfish.

What exactly makes it so good?

Stockfish really takes advantage

of super powerful computers.

It searches tens of millions of physicians per second.

So if you give it 30 seconds,

it's gonna be searching upwards of a billion positions

and that's more positions than a human

will see in their entire lifetime.

I could live a hundred lifetimes.

I would not be able to win this game.

Not only that, the evaluation function it uses,

it's a way of assessing the board.

By itself is probably stronger than almost all the

chess players in the world.

Your chess Elo is basically a number

that quantifies your skill level

and the highest ever Elo achieved

by a human is by Magnus Carlsen.

My Elo right now is 2,322.

What exactly is Stockfish's Elo right now?

It's probably greater than 3,500.

I never had a chance.

To understand how Stockfish actually thinks,

we should start at the very beginning of the game.

Most chess openings are subjective for humans.

A human will choose an opening

because they get more fun out of it.

You might like something because it gives you a big center

or very active pieces.

That's how most players choose their openings.

In my game against Stockfish, I played Pawn to D4.

Let's see which opening Stockfish plays

and it responded Knight to F6.

Gary, so the way humans learn chess openings, we read books,

we create chess files and we try to memorize them

'cause we can't access them during tournament games.

That would be like cheating on a school test.

An opening book in chess is a gigantic chess database.

Does Stockfish have a chess opening opinion as early

as the second or even first move?

The way that it thinks about the opening is

really different than a human.

It is not using chess theory.

It very rarely assesses an opening position.

What it's assessing is the resulting structures

that might evolve from that opening,

but way, way down the game tree, it's already assessing

the end game right from the getgo.

So on its second move, Stockfish played D5,

which is a very popular move.

And here I made a decision to capture this Knight.

Humans might see doubled pawns and feel unpleasant.

They might see a weakness in their position.

Does Stockfish have these little buzzwords like weakness

or inactive piece?

What actually goes into that?

The evaluation function is trained off of a huge library

of chess games that have been played.

And so it kind of absorbs that knowledge.

It's just all going into a giant neural net.

And then you can train your evaluation function

to learn what's good and what's bad.

And then that network runs when Stockfish is searching the

the position and then uses it to navigate the opening.

So to succeed in our quest

of understanding Stockfish a little bit better,

let's dive into middlegames.

Most middlegames begin around move 10 to 15.

It's the stage right

after the opening when you've gotten all your pieces out.

You can think of the middlegame in chess as a

gigantic ocean, this massive tree of possibility.

So in my middle game against Stockfish,

Pawn to C4 is what I played.

Stockfish played a move

that I don't think any human being

would play here against me.

The absurd pawn to G5, which made me audibly gasp.

Ho, ho, ho, ho. What is that? Oh my God.

Is that actually the best move in the position?

That move violates most human chess principles

that we have been brought up with?

You shouldn't push ponds in front of your king.

You should not weaken an area of the board

where you can't claim any advantage.

How does Stockfish break these age old principles?

In this case, it might just be that the move is too

far past kind of the human frontier to be a reasonable one.

It's gonna assess every possible

move and it's gonna rank them.

It all comes down to a single number,

which is what's the likelihood

that I'm gonna win from this position?

Stockfish doesn't have emotions

and opinions, it will just play the best move

that it thinks exists.

Yes, Stockfish definitely does not

emotionally consider it.

It is assessing with like grand master level quality,

but it then searches 50 moves, 60 moves into the future

to evaluate what is the best possible move.

I'm curious, like as an incredibly strong human,

how many moves do you search into the future?

I didn't realize this was the roast of Levy Rozman.

Sometimes I can go 10 moves, if it's an end game position

and I can kind of identify the forcing moves for both sides.

Sometimes I'm stuck in a middlegame

and I'm already indecisive.

It's like being at a restaurant.

You have three good options.

They're all very difficult to evaluate.

And I'll flip a coin,

but that doesn't work against Stockfish.

I counted, in this position, black has 41 legal moves.

How does Stockfish know which of those to scrub

and ultimately decide on one,

if three or four look really, really good,

It builds a game tree

and that game tree is gonna have all the legal moves.

It's gonna rank all of those moves.

It takes one step forward at a time.

It'll search two moves ahead,

then three moves ahead, then four moves ahead.

[Levy] Three or four moves speak to me

in about five seconds

and that's probably why I'm a good speed chess player.

But deciding on the best move,

sometimes I need to spend 5 minutes, 10 minutes

uncovering the truth about one of those moves.

Chess Computers actually do a similar sort of process.

Stockfish actually only looks at about two moves per

position and that's what's called the alpha beta search

technique, which is what Stockfish

and most other engines are built on top of.

Alpha Beta allows the engine to eliminate many,

many moves from a position because it knows that they are

worse than the best move that it's found so far.

And that allows alpha beta

to prune a huge amount of the search trees.

For example, if it was white's move,

one of the legal moves is Knight to E4 which is really,

really stupid because the Pawn would take the Knight

and white would be at a catastrophically worse position.

Some computers will just be able to discard this right away

and humans will too.

Alpha beta by itself can take those 35 moves that you have

to look at on average down to about 15 or so,

which is a huge reduction.

The last stage of chess is the endgame.

Is there any difference in the way

that Stockfish approaches the endgame

versus the middlegame or the opening?

Yes. Once the number of pieces goes

below a certain amount, seven,

then Stockfish can actually solve the game perfectly.

Chess is solved if there are seven pieces

remaining on a chessboard or less.

Exactly. Yeah.

There's what are called endgame table bases.

And by solved we mean literally every combination

of moves possible.

If the Bishop goes here and the Knight goes here,

or if the Bishop goes to that square originally

and the Knight goes there or there or there

or any of these combinations,

all of that is solved.

Literally Stockfish just has

to look up the position in its database

and it knows exactly what the answer is.

Even for seven pieces, it's only about 10 to 20 terabytes

of data, which is a lot.

But you know, manageable.

There is no more evaluating.

A best move is the best move

and a position is either winning,

a draw, or a losing, and that's it.

It's completely non-negotiable.

Exactly. Now the chess computers are capable

of playing without the table bases as well,

and they will still play incredibly strong chess there.

But they could make a mistake.

Gary, I lost to Stockfish.

I got checkmated in 34 moves,

so we didn't make it into an end game.

All right.

But that's just as well.

Stockfish always knows how

to close out a game in the least amount of moves,

even when the world's greatest players don't.

I have a game here, Magnus Carlsen versus Fabiano Caruana

from the 2018 World Chess Championship.

Magnus was in an end game where he was down a piece,

but neither one of them found the right technique.

Fabiano has a Bishop and a Knight,

and Magnus only has a Bishop.

Fabiano could not convert despite his extra material

because it looked like Magnus had a defensive fortress.

The game ended in a draw.

While the players were playing

and the entire world was watching,

Stockfish was screaming at them from the digital cyberspace

going, you idiots forced checkmate in 35 moves.

That is ridiculous.

Like how could it have possibly known

that if both sides made a move

for 35 moves, black would win.

What Stockfish can do is look forward into the table

bases and every path to the table bases.

The best that you can possibly do is that mate in 35.

If Stockfish was playing black here instead of Fabiano,

it would've played Bishop to H4,

then bring its Knight here

and then trap its own Knight on the edge of the board.

So the Knight now cannot escape anywhere

because white's bishop would take it.

No human being would play chess like this.

You cannot trap your Knight on the edge of the board,

but apparently white actually runs out of moves first

and slowly but surely black would've won that end game.

Stockfish saw that from a distance.

No human on the planet saw that.

So Stockfish is a very, very specialized AI.

How does it compare to some other AIs,

autonomous cars or something else?

Stockfish is only good at one thing

and it's super good at that one thing,

which is playing chess.

Chess engines have now borrowed the state

of the art research and artificial intelligence,

which is deep learning.

However, they're still fundamentally limited

to the domain of chess.

Chess has, I think, been opened up, in a way, by AI.

People can leverage the chess engines

to improve their own skills,

and that's kind of like the ideal use case

for AI technologies, is that they help humans,

you know, do things better.

I agree with Gary.

I think AI has been a net benefit for chess.

I think it's helping people improve at a rate

like we've never experienced.

We do obviously have to tackle the issue

of potential cheating,

but I'm gonna stay positive and optimistic.

Anyway, now that I know a little bit more about Stockfish,

I'm gonna go have my rematch.",technology
"The trip marked his tenth to the capital to discuss — and lobby for — migrant funding since taking office, City Hall reps said.

On this week’s trip, Adams didn’t get any commitments of federal reimbursements for asylum-seeker care, allowance for more migrants to legally work, or a plan to enact a “decompression strategy” to divert migrants from New York — requests he is making as he grapples with an influx of more than 150,000 people seeking asylum since last spring. He readily describes it as a crisis that he predicts will cost the city $12 billion over three years.

While his priorities remain in limbo, Adams is getting some help.

FEMA Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg confirmed the disaster agency will have a staffer embedded in the mayor’s office “to help streamline the information sharing” — something Adams’ chief of staff Camille Joseph Varlack mentioned last month.

Congress is in the midst of negotiating a supplemental budget package that could get Adams some of what he wants, like aid for municipalities serving migrants, and stricter border policies. But not even the powerful leaders from New York can promise the mayor anything at this point.

“People think that Schumer and Jeffries know what will happen and are keeping it close to the vest, but we really don’t know what will happen,” a New York-affiliated Hill staffer granted anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations told POLITICO.

Another person close to negotiations described them as “extremely fluid.”

But the city’s delegation is on board with securing more money for New York, the staffer said, adding: “He shouldn’t feel disheartened that Democrats don’t understand that the migrant crisis is fucking killing us.”

The problem has overwhelmed City Hall since migrants seeking asylum began coming to New York in larger numbers last year. Adams has continually lamented the situation, while using the issue as a scapegoat for his and the city’s myriad problems. As a result, his and Biden’s once-chummy relationship has taken a turn.

Just this week, a Quinnipiac University poll revealed the depths of Adams’ troubles: A mere 28 percent of New York City voters approve of his job performance. The mayor once again blamed that result on the federal government declining to support New York more as it contends with migrants who need housing, work and schooling.

Just 26 percent of city voters approve of the way he’s handling migrants.

“Our residents are weary, our residents are angry, our residents are seeing the impact of the migrants and asylum-seeker issue,” he said, “how it is taking away from the resources that should go to the day-to-day resources of running a city.”

Adams responded Friday by doing what many politicians do in times of crisis — surrounding himself with religious leaders.

The mayor held a press conference on religious unity at a time when the city has seen a 250 percent rise in ethnically-motivated hate crimes in the last two months, he said Friday, including a 150 percent rise in antisemitic hate crimes.

Adams was also given a surprising show of solidarity from Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who has been floated as a progressive challenger to the mayor for his reelection.

“A lot of folks might take too much time talking about what makes he and I different. When we’re together, we talk about what makes us the same and the things we agree on,” Reynoso said — gifting the mayor a toy sanitation truck to highlight their mutual antipathy toward rats.

But don’t read into the action for insight on a potential mayoral run, he said in a text message after the event: “Just showing love, nothing more.”",political
"I don’t know who needs a battery-powered combination refrigerator, freezer, and ice maker on wheels that can be charged by a solar panel, but I like knowing that you’re out there, wandering the planet with a cocktail in hand while bending Mother Nature to your will.

The EcoFlow Glacier is pitched at RV and boat owners or anyone looking to bring modern luxuries into the great outdoors. Its list price starts at $1,099 / €1,199, but that’s before adding extras like a 297Wh battery for a day away from the grid, wheels and telescoping handle to make the 50.7-pound (23kg) unit more portable when its 38-liter (40-quart) capacity is maxed out with food and drinks, and up to 240W of solar panels to keep that beach party bumpin’ for as long as the sun will shine.

I’ve been testing the Glacier for a few weeks, and I’m starting to understand its appeal. It helps that I’m a budding vanlifer who also enjoys the occasional libation.

8 Verge Score EcoFlow Glacier $ 1099 The Good Efficient: lasts about a day on battery under heavy usage

Importantly, the Glacier cools down fast. EcoFlow claims it will drop the temperature from 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) in 15 minutes. In my battery test at home in a room measuring 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius), it took 17 minutes for the Glacier to cool down to my desired dual-zone temperatures of 42.8 degrees Fahrenheit (6 degrees Celsius) for the fridge and 14 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 10 degrees Celsius) for the freezer. The reported temperature on the built-in display and EcoFlow’s app aligned closely with my own thermometer, which measured 6 degrees Celsius and negative 9 degrees Celsius on the two sides. On the fridge side, I packed a jug of prechilled milk alongside bottles of room temperature tonic water, and in the freezer, I placed two bags of ice and half a loaf of bread.

The compressor is noisy when initially cooling down the unit, measuring about 41dB from one meter away in my testing. It then goes almost completely silent, minus the occasional gurgle and some weird scratching sounds, which I’m told is gas inside the fridge moving through a one-way valve. The sound is akin to a tired but determined little mouse trying to escape a steel bucket loaded with thumbtacks. It’s noticeable in a very quiet room but infrequent and subtle enough that it took me a few days to realize that my house did not, in fact, have an infestation issue.

In regular power (not Eco) mode, the compressor comes on every 30 minutes or so and then runs for about three minutes to maintain my desired temperatures. At 32dB, the sound isn’t too bad, but it’s loud compared to any modern built-in kitchen fridge and something you’d definitely notice when sleeping nearby.

A removable divider separates the fridge and freezer sections, and the EcoFlow Glacier can automatically detect if it is inserted. When it is, you are presented with temperature controls for the two separate zones. Otherwise, EcoFlow treats the internal capacity as one giant fridge or freezer with space under the lid to store the divider. The Glacier also remembers your previous temperature settings when the partition is added or removed. Smart.

The unit itself is sturdy enough to sit on. Configured as a dual-zone fridge (left) and freezer (right). The ice maker is underneath the tumbler. Eighteen cubes in about 18 minutes. The hollow cubes are reasonably thick.

Making ice is rather interesting since you have to make it and then detach it. Let me explain.

You first need to fill the reservoir with up to 1.4 liters (a little over a third of a gallon) of water. That’s enough to make about five batches of ice before a refill warning appears in the app and on the unit itself. You then hit the “make ice” button in the app or on the Glacier control panel, choose either small or large cubes, and wait anywhere between 11 and 17 minutes — the first round of ice takes longer. The ice forms around a field of 18 metal pins inside the reservoir, and it’s loud. In my testing, it hit around 51dB from a distance of one meter for the entire ice-making process. The unit beeps when finished and continues to do so until you run a separate operation to detach the ice. Fortunately, the beep can be turned off in the settings.

The excellent EcoFlow app clearly shows the two steps required to make ice, alongside desired and actual temperatures, and battery power remaining.

Hit the “detach ice” button to begin releasing the ice from the pins. This process took anywhere between 30 seconds and three minutes in my testing. Once the countdown timer is complete, a little tug on the basket lifts the hollow ice ovals out of the reservoir, but not without dripping water everywhere if you forget to shake off the excess. Good thing that Glacier has an IPX4 resistance to splashing water and light rain. The ice produced is relatively robust, making bigger ice “cubes” with thicker walls than those produced by my own dedicated ice machine.

EcoFlow says that the Glacier will run for up to 40 hours off its 297Wh battery, but my real-world testing yielded just 22 hours. That actually seems reasonable since I was using it heavily in regular power mode — not Eco mode. I made ice four times — two batches of small cubes and two batches of large — for a total of 72 cubes during my battery test, all while the fridge was loaded and keeping each compartment cooled at a steady 6 degrees Celsius / negative 10 degrees Celsius as described above. Glacier’s 120W DC compressor consumed about 12Wh to 15Wh of power during each session, which is very good compared to typical ice makers that use inefficient AC compressors. I could have extended battery life in Eco mode, which allows for a wider range of temperature fluctuations.

Plugged into an EcoFlow smart plug (sold separately), I can see the power consumed over a day in full-power mode; dual-zone (6 degrees Celsius / negative 10 degrees Celsius) cooling; and three batches of ice (see power spikes).

When plugged into an AC outlet, the Glacier used a total of 394Wh over a 24-hour period. During that time, I made three batches of ice, while continuing to operate in a dual-zone (6 degrees Celsius / negative 10 degrees Celsius) configuration. Eco mode in the same scenario consumed 354Wh in a day.

As for portability, the removable telescoping handle and wheels are a necessity, in my opinion, for anyone who needs to even semi-regularly move the 30.6 × 15.2 × 17.5 inch (776 × 385 × 445mm) unit from place to place, especially when loaded with food and drinks. The handle is a bit short for my six-foot frame, which caused me to bash the fridge into the back of my legs at times. Further, the wheels are rigid, causing the fridge (and the glass bottles inside) to vibrate like hell when pulled along bumpy roads. But I’d rather suffer those indignities than have to carry this beast alone for more than a few feet at a time.

The handle and wheels are sold as an option but are likely required for many. The Glacier weighs almost 51 pounds (23kg) before loading it with food and drinks.

Some other notable considerations:

The Glacier can’t be powered by solar alone. Connected panels simply charge the removable battery via an XT60 port on the fridge.

You also can’t make ice when only powered off a 12V cigarette outlet — another reason you’ll want to pay more for an optional battery or two.

The battery chemistry is Li-NMC, not LFP, in order to pack more capacity into a smaller space.

The Glacier has a single XT60 input port for power / charging (car and wall adapters included in the box).

EcoFlow says the battery charges in as little as 2.1 hours under perfect 240W (11–60V, 13A Max) solar conditions (which don’t exist), 2.2 hours from AC (180W), or about four hours (12V) or 2.1 hours (24V) when plugged into a vehicle (192W, 8A Max).

The removable battery has a bidirectional 100W USB-C PD port. That means it can charge your gadgets while also powering the fridge or be recharged via the same USB-C charger you use for your phone or laptop.

Cleaning the ice maker’s water reservoir is a challenge with all those pins sticking up. The water can be drained via a small hose hidden by a panel door — something you’ll want to do before trying to roll it away. Otherwise, the water will slosh out.

The built-in carrying handles on the top left and top right of the unit can also be removed for more permanent installations.

When the lid is open, two lights help illuminate the insides.

The Glacier can join your local network over 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, where it can then be monitored and controlled remotely via the excellent EcoFlow app. It also supports Bluetooth for direct connectivity.

Oddly, the Glacier doesn’t offer a direct DC battery port to receive power directly (and efficiently) from one of EcoFlow’s own lineup of giant batteries.

As a gadget fan and outdoor enthusiast, I must say that I really like the EcoFlow Glacier. It does what it says it will on the box and performs each function well, which is really saying something for a three-in-one appliance. But let’s be real, if you’re going to buy this thing, then you should almost certainly get it with a battery for $1,399 / €1,399 and likely the removable wheels / handle combo as well, boosting the price by another $99 / €119.

Is that price justified? Hard to say, because if you’re the type looking for an ice-making fridge / freezer combo for use in remote locations, then the usual rules of value for money probably don’t apply. It’s really a question of how much you’re willing to spend to take modern comforts into places where those luxuries aren’t usually available.

Fortunately, EcoFlow devices are regularly on sale, especially during the end-of-year holidays, which could save you 20 percent or more on that list price.",technology
"Part of / Building for tomorrow

At CES in 2021, 5G was just about everywhere you looked. It was the future of mobile communications that would propel autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and AR into reality. The low latency! The capacity! It’ll change everything, we were told. Verizon and AT&T wrote massive checks for new spectrum licenses, and T-Mobile swallowed another network whole because it was very important to make the 5G future happen as quickly as possible and win the race.

CES 2024 is just around the corner, and while telecom executives were eager to shout about 5G to the rafters just a few years ago, you’ll probably be lucky to hear so much as a whisper about it this time around. While it’s true that 5G has actually arrived, the fantastic use cases we heard about years ago haven’t materialized. Instead, we have happy Swifties streaming concert footage and a new way to get internet to your home router. These aren’t bad things! But deploying 5G at the breakneck speeds required to win an imaginary race resulted in one fewer major wireless carrier to choose from and lots of debt to repay. Now, network operators are looking high and low for every bit of profit they can drum up — including our wallets.

If there’s a poster child for the whole 5G situation in the US, it’s Verizon: the loudest and biggest spender in the room. The company committed $45.5 billion to new spectrum in 2021’s FCC license auction — almost twice as much as AT&T. And we don’t have to guess whether investors are asking questions about when they’ll see a return — they asked point blank in the company’s most recent earnings call. CEO Hans Vestberg fielded the question, balancing the phrases “having the right offers for our customers” and “generating the bottom line for ourselves,” while nodding to “price adjustments” that also “included new value” for customers. It was a show of verbal gymnastics that meant precisely nothing.

Verizon in particular has cried 5G wolf more than once

But in an indirect way, the whole rest of Verizon’s earnings update gives us a good picture of exactly how 5G is going for the carrier. There’s no talk of robot surgery or fleets of autonomous cars. As it turns out, you need a standalone 5G network to deploy a lot of those things — something carriers are still building out gradually. Verizon in particular is guilty of crying 5G wolf more than once. First, it tried to tell us that mmWave was the real 5G, which is fast but way too range-limited for any of those use cases. Then, it tried to sell us on low-band 5G, which actually turned out to be slower than 4G in some cases. The company is now slowly converting its existing network into standalone 5G as it lights up mid-band spectrum, but that’s a yearslong effort.

On that earnings call, Vestberg did point to a pillar of Verizon’s current 5G strategy that doesn’t require a complete overhaul of the company’s nationwide network: selling private networks, or secure, high-bandwidth networks, for industrial and manufacturing businesses. But as another investor on the recent earnings call notes, it was hardly mentioned outside of some passing remarks about its potential. What gives?

Vestberg says that this is coming along slowly. One problem standing in the company’s way, RCR Wireless News editor-in-chief Sean Kinney explains to The Verge, is that carriers aren’t really set up to sell their services to specific industries. “If you’re going to sell 5G and edge computing services to a hospital, you need a sales organization that understands healthcare. That knows exactly how hospitals run, knows what their problems are. You need that for every vertical industry — for transportation, logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing and hospitality. And that’s just a hard thing to do.”

Bringing 5G to sectors like manufacturing isn’t exactly a snap of the fingers, either. Not every kind of manufacturer even needs or wants 5G, for starters. Kinney says there’s potential in certain kinds of manufacturing like automotive, but lots of factories tend to be, well, old and don’t lend themselves well to fast upgrades. “How do I put a SIM card in a robotic arm that I bought in 1982? You can do it, but was it worth it? Did it actually deliver?”

“How do I put a SIM card in a robotic arm that I bought in 1982?”

Instead, there’s one 5G use case where the big three networks are finding traction, and it comes up over and over again in their earnings reports: fixed wireless access, or FWA. If you’re keeping score at home, that’s internet that comes to your house over radio waves rather than a cable. T-Mobile and Verizon have aggressively expanded their FWA offerings over the past couple of years, and even “fiber is everything” AT&T is getting in on the action with Internet Air. It’s nice for people to have more than one option for high-speed internet, but it’s hardly robot surgery — it’s not even necessarily the best way to improve the dismal state of home broadband.

If there’s a real, transformative benefit to 5G, it will likely be a combination of network advances and changes in behavior. People will start to see 5G working in situations where they wouldn’t expect to have a reliable data connection — just ask any of the Taylor Swift fans who moved a collective 29 terabytes of data on AT&T’s network in a single day on her Arlington, Texas, Eras Tour stop. Those kinds of crowded stadium events are where 5G’s extra capacity really outshines LTE.

AT&T spokesperson Jim Greer points out that the company has also seen a 30 percent annual increase in traffic on its network overall and said in an emailed statement to The Verge that “the 5G network is the ‘killer app’ that will change how we live and work.” Maybe 5G wasn’t a destination, it was a journey, etc. There’s something to that — when you realize you actually can stream video from a packed stadium or that you don’t have to wait until you’re at home on Wi-Fi to download something, your thinking changes about what you can expect from your connection.

Jeff Fieldhack, a director at Counterpoint Research, also sees real potential in network slicing, where carriers can give priority to certain kinds of network traffic. That’s important for safety-critical applications, like autonomous cars. Fieldhack says that slicing would allow networks to “prioritize the car going in through the intersection and not the YouTuber in the backseat.” Right now, they can’t distinguish between the two. There’s just one catch: as mentioned previously, you need a standalone 5G network to make that work. That’s something that only T-Mobile has achieved on a nationwide scale. AT&T’s and Verizon’s 5G networks still rely largely on 4G cores, and the switch to standalone 5G is a slow, yearslong project that is ongoing.

Even if 5G isn’t all smoke and mirrors, networks have backed themselves into a corner

Maybe 5G isn’t entirely smoke and mirrors. But by rolling it out with a breakneck “race,” networks backed themselves into a corner. They took on piles of debt; on that recent earnings call, a Verizon exec talked about the company’s desire to return to pre-spectrum-auction levels of debt. In the meantime, there are few returns to show for those investments — not helped by the fact that interest levels are high and smartphone sales are down. The networks thought they had a golden goose with 5G, but so far, it’s just laying regular old eggs — expensively, at that. And while they’re waiting for their efforts to bear fruit, they’re looking for other ways to boost their bottom line.

The simplest way to make more money is what Verizon calls “pricing actions.” That’s a nice way of saying “charging customers more.” The company boasted about implementing “over one billion dollars of annualized pricing actions in 2023” and pats itself on the back for keeping churn — that would be customers ditching Verizon — low in spite of it.

Maybe that’s because switching carriers is a chore that most people don’t want to undertake or that we’re all just numb to inflation-related price increases. But it probably doesn’t help that most of us have just two other networks to choose from even if we were determined to jump ship. And that’s one more piece of the 5G puzzle that’s missing: the fourth wireless carrier that was supposed to materialize from T-Mobile’s Sprint acquisition deal.

We know the story: T-Mobile was allowed to gobble up Sprint by selling Boost to Dish Network, which would use it as a springboard to become the country’s fourth wireless carrier while building its own standalone 5G network from scratch. One in, one out. How’s that going? Well, Dish has hit the coverage requirements set by the FCC as part of the deal. But it’s not as simple as “if you build it, they will come.” When it was sold to Dish, Boost had 9 million subscribers; now it has 7.5 million. And according to founder Charlie Ergen on the company’s last earnings call, of those 7.5 million people, the “vast majority” don’t have a phone that works on Dish’s own network. Instead, they run on the networks of AT&T or T-Mobile, which Dish contracts with as an MVNO.

More phones are starting to support Dish’s network bands, including the iPhone 15. But according to Ergen, the timing of T-Mobile’s shutdown of Sprint’s legacy CDMA network meant that Dish had to hurry up and replace a lot of phones for customers at a time when most new phones didn’t support the new network. Those customers likely aren’t ready to replace their phones just yet. Dish will next face its steepest challenge yet: covering 70 percent — and 75 percent, in some cases — of the population in each economic area where it holds certain spectrum licenses. In its Q3 earnings filings, the company said it “may need to make significant additional investments or partner with others” to hit that target. Doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.",technology

"This evolution has occurred for many reasons. Most of them trace more to the political exigencies of this era than the pursuit of justice.

When O’Connor was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, the judicial confirmation process had yet to become the partisan vise it is today. Presidents sought to choose broadly acceptable nominees, with at least equal attention to the nominee’s attainments as to their judicial ideology.

Politicians, especially, tended to have fairly opaque judicial ideologies. O’Connor was a stalwart Republican, dating back to Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign, but her judicial profile was less clear than her political leanings: She had spent five years as a county judge, rarely weighing in on national issues, and two years as an Arizona appeals-court judge. Thus, she was nominated mainly for what she had accomplished in life, and not to enact any judicial agenda.

By the standards of 1981, O’Connor’s experiences were highly useful for a high-court nominee. County courts are where the judicial rubber meets the road, where real-life disputes find their way into the legal system. O’Connor was charged with achieving a just result for prosecutors, defendants and civil plaintiffs in a wide array of cases. Her time on the campaign trail had also put her in contact with average people, helping her to better understand their expectations of the government and justice system.

Implicit in her role as Senate majority leader — for which she was the first woman in any state — was a certain amount of deal-making and compromise. This was not, of course, reflexive compromise, but rather the need to decide carefully when to draw a sharp line of principle and when to accept deals that achieve only some worthy aims. Presumably, a key consideration in any deal must be the greater good of the public.

But while politicians are, by the very nature of their work, attuned to the interest of the public, they also must take stances on politically divisive issues. And therein was the rub. As judicial nominations increasingly became proxy fights over abortion rights, having a record of either supporting or opposing such rights — while also weighing in on affirmative action, same-sex marriage or other social flashpoints — quickly became a liability. Eventually, it became an outright barrier to nomination.

In the 1990s and 2000s, elected politicians with strong legal credentials from Mario Cuomo to Orrin Hatch to Deval Patrick were often mentioned as potential high-court nominees but quickly dismissed because of their long records on various social issues. The huge volume of speeches and media interviews and campaign commercials simply served up too much fodder for critics. There was no way these public servants could survive the confirmation process.

In a rich irony, younger nominees with little experience outside of the classroom or federal bench turned out to have cleaner records — but more deeply ingrained views. It’s hard to argue that the people who supported them didn’t know this and want this; the charade of choosing nominees for their legal acumen when they were actually being elevated for their fidelity to a policy agenda fooled almost no one. Confirmation battles tended to turn on cat-and-mouse disputes over lines in judicial opinions or aspects of a nominee’s personal lives after which senators voted increasingly along party lines.

Some of the same nominees who, by dint of their slender record, could pose as neutral arbiters of the Constitution for the purposes of the confirmation process brought to their court work the haughty certitude of faculty-lounge debates. Whatever its outward attempts to portray civility, the court in its written opinions took on the character of a law-school debating society. Confident in their ideology and surrounded by like-minded figures, justices often voted a party line on divisive social issues but defended their stances as matters of high judicial principle. In their rock-ribbed views of the Constitution there was little room for interpretation, let alone compromise.

For many years, O’Connor was the main antidote to this tortured dynamic. She was widely advertised as the court’s swing justice. It fell to her, along with fellow justices David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, to craft a middle ground on abortion in the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. That opinion became a virtual fly paper for critics on the left and right. And yet now, in the wake of O’Connor’s death, many legal and political leaders are yearning for just such a compromise.

The historical assessment of politicians on the court is mixed. But so too are the assessments of legal practitioners and academic-minded judges. The logical conclusion is that each type of justice brings different skills to the table. Former California Gov. Earl Warren drew on the negotiating ability from a long career in politics to stitch together a 9-0 majority against school segregation in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education.

In my own research into Justice John Marshall Harlan, known for his dissenting opinions on racial segregation and economic rights that have been vindicated over time, political experience played a different role. Harlan’s dissents centered on his disagreement with his colleagues’ reading of the Constitution but unfailingly included passages assessing the impact of the court’s decisions on average people and the overall trajectory of the nation. Clearly, Harlan believed the court’s mission was not only to be faithful to the national charter but to rend a just result for all.

Like O’Connor, Harlan had an early career in elective politics alongside many other formative experiences. The sheer fullness of his life added to his wisdom and character. Some of the current justices can draw on instincts honed during other chapters of their careers, but many, arguably, cannot.

The vociferous tributes to O’Connor suggest that, at the very least, the effective ban on former politicians serving as high-court justices deprives the court of relevant experience. It remains to be seen whether, with the abortion debate entering a new chapter, future presidents and Senates will open themselves to a broader range of judicial candidates.",political
"Your PC's graphics card is the part that has the biggest impact on gaming performance. After a couple of years in which it was impossible to find the best graphics cards for less than MSRP, we're seeing some solid sales and everyday low prices.



But, with scores of third-party cards and many different sellers, it can be difficult to determine what the lowest price is for an RTX 4060, a Radeon RX 7600, or any GPU across all brands and stores. That's why we're updating this page daily with the lowest prices in the U.S. on each GPU from the most recent two generations of Nvidia, AMD, and Intel cards. We're listing the lowest price today for each graphics card, regardless of whether it's made by Asus, Zotac, MSI, Sapphire, Gigabyte, ASRock, etc.

Check out our list of the best graphics cards and our GPU benchmark hierarchy to see evergreen performance data to help you make an informed decision when choosing a new GPU for your system.

Nvidia RTX 40-Series: Lowest Graphics Cards Prices

Nvidia's 40-series graphics cards include the most powerful GPU currently available, the Geforce RTX 4090. The 4090 combines a massive 24GB of GDDR6X VRAM, with superfast core clock speeds and Nvidia's 4th generation of Tensor cores for unrivaled ray-tracing ability.



The RTX 40-series cards also feature Nvidia's proprietary DLSS 3 software support for AI frame generation, which helps to increase frame rates on higher resolutions and settings. In general, Nvidia cards are best for ray tracing, with more features than the competition. You'll also generally pay more for Nvidia GPUs relative to similarly performing AMD GPUs.



The 4090 isn't on ""sale"" anywhere, as demand remains high. Impending China export restrictions on the RTX 4090 aren't likely to help matters, and we're seeing an upward trend in pricing for that GPU. The other RTX 40-series GPUs are all selling below MSRP, however, which is good to see. RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 cards in particular are far more competitively priced than at launch.

Nvidia RTX 30-Series: Lowest Graphics Cards Prices

The RTX 30-series was a huge step up in performance over the 20-series cards, especially in ray-tracing performance. Three years later, Nvidia's RTX 30-series GPUs remain capable cards, and prices have come down now that the supply chain shortages and cryptocurrency mining are over.



However, RTX 30-series cards don't support DLSS 3 frame generation, and they're no longer in production. Most 30-series cards cost more than you'd want to pay, with the exception of the lower-tier parts (3070 Ti and below). Unless you find an excellent deal on a 3090 or 3080 class card, we would look to the above 40-series parts.

AMD Radeon RX 7000-Series: Lowest Graphics Cards Prices

AMD's latest 7000-series of graphics cards offer a step-up in performance over the 6000-series, with increased ray-tracing performance and raw computational performance. Combined with AMD's FSR software, these GPUs can crank out the frame rates in the latest games.



Nearly all of these GPUs are selling below their launch MSRPs, sometimes by a fairly wide margin. The RX 7900 XT in particular represents a great blend of performance and features. Here are all the lowest prices for the 7000-series models currently available.

AMD Radeon RX 6000-Series: Lowest Graphics Card Prices

Some of the best value-for-money GPUs on offer, AMD's 6000-series of graphics cards provide great performance with a very respectable price tag. You can pick up an RX 6800 XT for less than an RTX 4070 and, at 1440p, it can often outperform the later in pure fps — at least in rasterization games.



The major downside to AMD Radeon RX 6000-series cards is that they aren't great for ray tracing, particularly at the low end. However, if you don't care about ray tracing, it's hard to find a better value. Many of AMD's newer 7000-series GPUs are more of a sideways step from the previous generation, with some new features but without a major boost to performance. The RX 7600 for example is only a few percent faster than an RX 6650 XT, and the same goes for the RX 7800 XT and RX 6800 XT.

Intel Arc GPUs: Lowest Graphics Card Prices

Intel's entry into the GPU market has been a little hit-and-miss. In some titles, these cards perform respectfully well, but in older DirectX games, the cards suffer from some poor performance issues.



Driver updates however are relatively frequent and many improvements have been made, but most of all, the prices of these GPUs have hit a price sweet spot that has been abandoned by Nvidia and AMD. For 1080p, gaming the Arc-series of GPUs should certainly be considered for any budget gaming system.

I'm Dr. Sanjay Juneja,

hematologist and medical oncologist.

I'm here to answer your questions from the internet.

This is Blood Support.

[upbeat music]

First up, What happens if person gets injected

with the wrong blood type?

It's gonna be really bad

and that's because it recognizes that protein as foreign,

as a virus, and it just goes rogue.

It's just like destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy.

Generally, we treat it with immediate steroids

and may need to consult some very fancy people

to try to churn the blood and get it right.

We have a question from @paydun.

Do we even know why we have different types of blood...

like really?

And the answer is we don't.

There's basically eight different basic ones

that are different variations.

You can have A, B, O or some combination.

And when we're saying those letters,

it basically reflects an antigen or a protein

on the surface of the red blood cells.

But we do know that certain areas

have more blood types than others.

One of the main reasons

is because of infections and viruses.

For example, malaria likes to get into red blood cells

and basically cause you all that sickness if you are type A.

So you'll see more type O in those areas

because they were less likely to die.

Next question from Ryan Rodriguez.

Could blood actually spray and/or jettison

from the human body as is sometimes seen

in movies, shows, and games?

The answer is yes.

If you cut an artery, that pressure is higher.

An artery is your oxygenated blood.

It's the stuff that just got the oxygen from the lungs

and is being pumped out.

It's the top number on your blood pressure,

and it carries oxygen and all the fuel and the stuff

that all your cells need to the tissue.

But when you're drawing blood

and the stuff that's the veins,

it shouldn't be at the pressure to be shooting out

at somebody.

Veins are a passive, more limpy process

because it's the bottom number of millimeters of mercury

on your blood pressure,

and it's the blood that is now deoxygenated.

It's done its job and the red blood cells are coming back

to get more oxygen into your lungs.

@Garrett_Sandlin, What the fuck is a hematologist...

Lol.

A very nerdy person usually that studies blood.

When we think of blood, you think of the the red stuff

and it carries oxygen, but it's actually far more than that.

It's constituted predominantly by three things.

Red blood cells, right? They carry oxygen.

They're like, Ooh, gimme oxygen, lungs

and then they go deliver it to the rest of your body.

But the other parts are white blood cells,

the antibody stuff that you hear about vaccines

that live for years.

The third part is platelets. Platelets help you clot.

They're the reason that when you get a cut,

it actually closes up.

Those are generally the three parts

and then the last one is what's called plasma.

And plasma is this beautiful harmony,

balance of taking care of things when it comes to clotting

and should you clot more, should you clot less

and fight infections.

Point being, there's a reason

that you have to do all of internal medicine for three years

and then an additional one or two years in hematology

just to understand how complicated this is.

Next question by Dr.Moxie Coms open,

What exactly is a hemorrhage?

A hemorrhage is a general term to just mean bleeding.

So you could be hemorrhaging, technically,

from your arm from a cut,

but we usually use it in a colloquial sense to mean a lot.

@spiidyy, What's the difference between red blood cells

and white blood cells?

Red blood cells are pretty much all the same thing

in your body.

They carry oxygen.

Oxygen is the fuel on every cell in your body.

White blood cells have all different kinds.

There's neutrophils and lymphocytes.

Neutrophils are stuff that go up with bacterial infection

and fight things when you inhale them

all the time walking around.

And then you have the lymphocytes,

which is all that antibody stuff.

Antibodies are smarter when it comes

to attacking pathogens or viruses and stuff.

That's why you get vaccines when you're young.

They're already prepped and ready.

They're hardwired because you gave them the wanted poster.

They're kind of smarter marines

and that's the whole concept behind vaccines

as well as just getting an infection.

Posted by ChampionK448, How do scabs work?

Scabs are basically the evidence of the clotting process.

The moment the endothelium,

that is the inner lining of the red blood vessel,

when it feels injury, it sends a whole cascade of markers

and signals and say, Yo, I'm like, I'm cut here.

And then the platelets, which are the things that float

in your bloodstream, they're actually yellow,

which is why they're found in plasma.

They basically are the endothelium,

the inside lining of the blood vessel floating around.

And then they go to that point of the injury

and then they get out these little tentacles

and they latch on and that's the platelet plug

and they start sending out a lot of signals.

Yo, yo, come. We need to regenerate this.

So when that platelet formation starts,

then you start getting a blood clot after that.

That is the immediate process that's happening

to quickly restore that as fast as possible.

Next question from @MugishaElliot, My doctor friends,

what causes a blood clot and how does it kill somebody?

A blood clot is actually a complicated downstream series

of events to make something that's hard

and put together, that's clotting.

We need to be able to clot, right, all the time.

I mean if you get a cut, you need to be able to clot it.

However, you can have a clot that comes out randomly.

This is an example of what happens if you get a blood clot.

Especially if this blood vessel was in your lungs,

a pulmonary embolism,

and you blocked the blood flow entirely

to be able to get oxygenated,

you're in big trouble.

Next question, @McCoyee,

What happens when you centrifuge blood?

We are basically spinning down the blood.

The blood has multiple components.

It has red blood cells that carry oxygen, it has plasma,

it has white blood cells that fight infection,

and it has those platelets.

So today, we'll be using an example,

back like science class, of oil, vinegar, and dye.

When you take that uniform solution

and you want to isolate your plasma,

if you put into the machine

and then the centripetal force forces the densest thing

to the outside, that's why it's angled.

And now you have a nice separation.

You have what looks like the plasma at the top,

which is clear, and that's the stuff

that if you get platelets

or you're getting the plasma stuff in a hospital,

you'll notice that the bag is yellow

and it's different than when you're getting red blood cells.

Next question, @ihatetrace,

Hey Siri, there's still blood in my urine.

How much is too much?

If you were seeing blood in your urine,

that's too much.

Even having red blood cells that you can't see

called microscopic hematuria

Any much is too much if you can see it.

@jacquesderridad, Is blood really blue in the body?

The blue concept is inaccurate.

The veins appear blue, which are the lining

or the piping that has the blood in it.

@uMthonos, How does the blood pressure arm thing work?

What a blood pressure cuff is doing

is assessing what pressure is your heart pumping at.

The left side of your heart is pumping blood

all throughout your body.

You continue to elevate the pressure

until the pressure in the cuff

is more than the pressure of your heart

pushing the blood to the end of your fingers,

and then you start to come down.

So you're at 180, 170, 160, 150, 140,

and then all of a sudden you hear that top number

of that strong left ventricle in your heart

able to start pushing.

That's when you know your top number.

And eventually, the beat fades away. Why?

Because the bottom number is the passive way that our blood

after it is done and given the oxygen to everything,

it needs to come back to the heart to get more oxygen.

By Deft with many Ts, Why do people faint

when they see blood?

The reason that we pass out in general

is because if our blood vessels dilate,

which is what's happening

when you see something that's scary,

and your brain is not receiving enough blood anymore.

So the theory is, through evolution,

our bodies learned that I'm having trouble getting blood

with oxygen and fuel to the most important organ in my body,

the least I can do is completely collapse

so I don't have to combat Newton's gravitational law

like downward.

Next question by Makala Phillips @98kala,

Every time I'm on my period,

I'm so confused how girls can bleed so much and still live.

Your bone marrow is constantly making blood.

And so if you were to check a reticulocyte,

which is a baby blood vessel, it's cute,

it's actually bigger than normal,

you'll see that during and after your cycle,

that reticulocyte count should be up.

That's showing that your bone marrow is spitting out

and trying to accommodate for the circumstances.

Because your red blood cells all only live

about 90 to 120 days so it's always doing it

and it knows when you need more.

@sirjeff32, Can someone die from high blood pressure?

Like this is a real question.

The answer is yes. Two times over.

You can die from acutely high blood pressure,

which means at that moment.

Too much, you know, Adderall, cocaine, methamphetamines

because they raise your blood pressure.

Now the blood pressure itself will not, you know,

kill someone,

but those blood vessels that are taking

that insult from the heart, it's 200, it's 220,

then if it cracks and pops open

now you're bleeding into your brain or anywhere else

and that can cause, obviously, immediate deaths.

But then over time, the reason people are so obsessive

about it is because that injury

from that flow of that blood pressure

over and over and over eventually start causing

this kind of stuff, plaque burdens and a little injury,

and then now this coronary artery disease

or cardiovascular disease is starting to clog up everything.

And remember the way that your heart functions,

your brain functions, your kidneys function,

all the things that are called vital organs

start losing the amount of circulating blood

and oxygen they need to operate correctly.

Next question from @MarkBski,

How often are new blood cells made

and what are they made from?

They're all made, for the most part, in the same place.

They are made in the same place and that's your bone marrow.

When you break a chicken bone, you see that dark,

you know, ruddy stuff.

It's in the bone, within the bone itself,

and they're basically prompted by stem cells

and your stem cells say, Hey, I need some more.

Your red blood cells live about 90 to 120 days.

So when they're getting kind of recycled in this spleen

and old, you make new ones from the bone marrow.

This next question from Ari, Weird question,

does anyone know if low white blood cell count

is ever serious?

If it deviates from your baseline

and you see this massive drop,

then that, generally, is thought to be something

to investigate or be serious.

But what's crazy is in Black Americans

and as well as some other minority groups,

ranges we have for normal are actually based

for the most part on Caucasian Americans

from like the 1980s.

They took 10,000 healthy people and were like

You look really healthy, let's see what your number is

and said, This is what we consider normal.

So up to one out of three to one out of five Black Americans

will actually repeatedly look low

on the white blood cell count,

but more specifically on the neutrophils.

That's something to be said about ranges.

So if you're ethnic and you're using the range

of someone in America of what our cutoffs are,

realize that we only know normal by sampling people

and saying You look healthy

and this is what we think is normal.

@Enoch_Nyanz, What are the signs of leukemia?

Leukemia is when something has gone very wrong,

very, very wrong in your bone marrow.

Your bone marrow has like a hierarchy and pecking order.

You have just the number of cells that you need

to differentiate and mature and grow.

When leukemia happens is it's not regulated anymore.

Cancer means unregulated cell growth.

If you have acute leukemia, market exhaustion,

market fatigue, your blood count is like super low,

and you may be losing weight,

and you're exquisitely sensitive to getting infections.

And oftentimes, you'll notice you start getting, you know,

spots of little pinpoint red dots out of nowhere

because your platelets are so low.

@Jinnah2Imran, Why do mosquitoes prefer some people,

but wouldn't bite others?

One of the main things that they're theorizing

is if you have more CO2,

which is bicarbonate, in your blood,

apparently mosquitoes can kind of almost sense

in the blood that has more bicarbonate.

Also, depending on what type you have, supposedly,

that may kind of trigger or have a predilection

on what mosquitoes favor.

But the truth is it's quite complicated

and we all wish that Noah

had just slapped those two mosquitoes.

Well, that's all the questions.

I really hope you learned something

and appreciate the blood system more.

We'll see you next time.",technology
"It’s not a great situation. The fact is I don’t think there are probably any platforms that have the tools they would need in place to address the problem through removing it. Addressing through removal is something that takes so much effort, especially if you want to have an appeals process, which you should think of as a human right in some ways.

What’s the alternative?

Well, you shouldn’t ever have just one approach to a problem, right? You want to have labels as well as the ability to remove certain types of content. You want to have a principled, structured approach on how you prioritize types of misinformation, what kind you remove versus don’t remove. And you want to communicate that to people so that they hopefully understand.

Education is really important. But here’s the challenge: Education is most impactful when you see it the moment that you need the information. You should immediately see a label like, “This has been determined to potentially be AI. We have this level of confidence that this is generated content.” There’s all sorts of things that could be explored.

Think about how unified the tech industry was around child sexual exploitation. It was the first thing that got all the different tech companies talking to each other, and then it was terrorism and then suicide, which are not great topics of conversations in the first place, of course. And those were first because they were so clear-cut in terms of being problematic. And this, misinformation generated by AI, is another thing that is clear-cut in terms of being problematic. I can almost guarantee you that tech companies are in fact set up to pass information to each other about different misinformation campaigns that are hitting the platform at different times.

Do you miss Twitter?

I miss a lot of the people. We had some pretty big hopes. We had some pretty great plans that we were really starting to shift toward, some major changes that we were trying to make. And I will probably always be a little bummed that I never got to see those come to completion or even the beginning of fruition.

Twitter in name is dead, but do you think Twitter, the platform, is dead?

I’d need more data before I could make that call. Anecdotally, certainly there’s been a lot fewer tweets. Also, dead in what way? There’s a very active right-wing Nazi group, some very active groups on there. I think it is dead in certain ways for certain things. And then for other people, it’s exactly what they want.

Do you think that there will ever be another Twitter?

I don’t know that that’s going to be super likely. It really was like lightning in a bottle in a lot of ways. Even in the aftermath of it, even with X, the fact that there’s Threads and Mastodon and Discord and Bluesky and all these other decentralized nodes and new platforms and everybody wants a piece of it and they’re all going for it … that’s cool. Right? Rad. Go people! But it’s fragmented.

At its shining moment, Twitter was like the Tower of Babel before it fell.

"In the mornings in Varanasi, the air on the banks of the Ganges fills with the scent of burning bodies. On the steps of the Manikarnika ghat—the holiest of the city’s stepped riverbanks, upon which Hindu dead are cremated—the fires are already lit, and mourners assemble by the hundred to accompany their loved ones at the end. Pyres of sandalwood (for the rich) and mango wood (for everyone else) are already burning; on one, a corpse wrapped in white is visible in the flames.

Down at the river, where I’m watching from a boat, some families are engaged in the ceremonial washing of their dead, the corpses shrouded in white linen and decorated with flowers. A few meters away, a man from another family (usually, the honor is bestowed on the eldest son) wades into the water, casting in the ashes of an already cremated relative so that the Ganges might carry their spirit onwards to the next life or even moksha, the end of the rebirth cycle, and transcendence.

The funeral ceremonies, held against the backdrop of the ancient city, are undeniably beautiful; but the same can’t be said of the river itself. The water’s surface is flaked with ashes; ceremonial flowers linger in the eddies. Just downstream, a couple of men are diving for discarded jewelry. Not 50 meters upstream, another group, having finished their rites, are bathing in the filthy water. An older man, clad in white, finishes his bathing with a traditional blessing: He cups the fetid Ganges water in one hand and takes a sip.

The Ganges is one of the most densely populated river basins in the world, providing water for an estimated 600 million people. But to Hindus, it is more than a waterway: It is Ma Ganga, the mother river, formed—according to the sacred text the Bhagavata Purana—when Lord Vishnu himself punctured a hole in the universe and divine water flooded into the world. Water from the Ganges is widely used in Hindu prayer and ceremony; you can buy plastic bottles of it from stalls all over the subcontinent—or order one on Amazon in the UK for as little as £3.

And yet despite its sacred status, the Ganges is one of the most contaminated major rivers on earth. The UN has called it “woefully polluted.” As India’s population has exploded—in April 2023, it overtook China to become the world’s most populous country—hundreds of millions of people have settled along the Ganges’ floodplain. India’s sanitation system has struggled to keep up. The Ganges itself has become a dumping ground for countless pollutants: toxic pesticides, industrial waste, plastic, and, more than anything, billions upon billions of liters of human effluent.

It’s March 2022, and I’ve come to India while reporting my book, Wasteland, about the global waste industry. And few issues in waste are more critical (yet less sexy) than sanitation. In the global north, sewage is a problem that many of us assumed was more or less fixed in Victorian times. But access to clean water and adequate sanitation remains an urgent global issue. Some 1.7 billion people worldwide still do not have access to modern sanitation facilities.",technology
"Stupid. Divisive. Fugly. The Hummer shouldn’t have sold in numbers, but it did. Might Elon Musk pull off a similar trick with the stainless steel Cybertruck?

Forty-six months after the official unveiling—when design chief Franz von Holzhausen famously shattered the prototype’s Armor Glass with the spirited throw of a metal ball—yesterday’s Cybertruck Delivery Event confirmed that Tesla’s Texan Gigafactory is finally now slowly spitting out Cybertrucks.

With an estimated 2 million preorders from self-styled “reservationists,” this Blade Runner–inspired electric pickup could make the world’s most wealthy man even more unfeasibly rich. If half of those $100 refundable deposits stack up, that’s revenue of more than $65 billion, based on a newly inflated $61,000 price tag—up $21,000 from what was promised four years ago.

“Just 15 percent of those preorders would equal the annual US truck sales of Toyota,” says Boston University Questrom School of Business professor Tim Simcoe. “But Tesla faces the challenges of scaling up production and achieving a sufficient flow of paying customers.”

On Tesla’s March 1 Investor Day, Musk said demand for the Cybertruck was “so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” But landing even 15 percent of the reservationists seems optimistic because the vehicle is running late and isn’t global—Cybertruck won’t be for sale outside of the US, Canada, and Mexico for some time, and doesn’t appear to meet safety regulations in the European Union and Australia anyway.

The price bump will also be a drag on demand. The vehicles picked up by the 10 or so customers yesterday—likely to be “manufacturing unit” one-offs rather than true retail models, and which will be tethered to Tesla for some time—was $21,000 more expensive than the $39,900 base model promised in November 2019. Crucially, the world has moved on since, with a slew of competitors selling here-now, traditionally-shaped product.

Ford snuck in ahead with its $49,000 F-150 Lightning, the battery-powered version of the truck that has dominated the pickup segment for decades. GM will soon roll out its $52,000 electric Chevy Silverado, and Stellantis is readying its $58,000 RAM 1500 REV. Extroverts wanting a look-at-me e-candy truck can buy Rivian’s $73,000 R1T.

F-150 Lightning owner Coleson Bruce, a pickup driver for 30 years, might switch from Ford to Tesla. “I put in a reservation [for a Cybertruck] the day after the original reveal,” the tech startup executive told WIRED on a Zoom call. “While I’m not one of the earliest in line, I have the possible advantage of being in Austin,” he says. Historically, Tesla’s new product deliveries have often been weighted toward favored geographies rather than first-come-first-serve, Bruce says.",technology
"Not a flattering portrayal of Sam Altman.

A new report from The Washington Post says that senior OpenAI staffers had indicated to the board Altman had been “psychologically abusive.” The board had also worried that it couldn’t keep Altman accountable.

All of that contributed to Altman’s firing, the report says — though, as we now know, Altman ultimately came out on top.",technology
"Could the best graphics cards of the future be made in Vietnam? Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, will discuss potential semiconductor collaboration with the Vietnamese government and companies in Hanoi on Monday, Reuters reports. The move could be an attempt by Nvidia to diversify its supply chain and reduce reliance on its traditional partners.

The meetings will explore potential partnerships and technology sharing between Nvidia and its partners. Reuters claims an invitation letter to the event points to ways 'to boost the semiconductor industry' in Vietnam and 'Nvidia's potential partnership with Vietnamese tech firms.'

Vietnam is not known for chip manufacturing, but the first name that comes to mind when discussing this country in the semiconductor context is Intel, which has an extensive test and assembly facility near Ho Shin Minh City. This facility plays a crucial role in Intel's global supply chain, yet the company scrapped plans to make additional investments in the facility.

Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions open the doors for Vietnam to move beyond chip assembly to chip production. One of the main points of interest is whether Nvidia agrees to share technology with at least one Vietnamese company.

An industry insider, who wished to stay anonymous, suggested that such a deal is expected to happen at the meeting. This could be a big step in transferring important technology to Vietnam, helping it become more influential in the global semiconductor market.

Major Vietnamese companies like FPT, Vingroup, and Viettel are set to attend the meeting, though they are not sharing any specific deals they might be discussing. The report says the Vietnamese investment ministry, which is organizing the event, has not made any comments either.

Many companies are trying hard to reduce reliance on China-based and sometimes Taiwan-based production facilities due to geopolitical risks and the U.S. crackdown against China's artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and semiconductor sectors.

Nvidia has already moved the assembly of its AI and HPC hardware from China, but its chips are still made and assembled in Taiwan. It is evident that the company might be exploring ways to diversify its supply chain further, but how Nvidia could use Vietnam remains to be seen.",technology
"Say goodbye to the Chevy Bolt EV... again.

General Motors won’t be bringing over the original hatchback Bolt to the automaker’s Ultium platform, just the larger Bolt EUV, GM confirmed after InsideEVs first reported the news. That comes after GM said it was discontinuing Bolt production but later confirmed that it would resurrect the EV as an Ultium vehicle for 2025.

The original Bolt EV was built on GM’s older and soon-to-be-obsolete BEV2 platform. The automaker has since shifted to the Ultium battery architecture for its next-generation EVs, including the Cadillac Lyriq, Hummer EV, and GMC Sierra EV. Chevy is building a trio of Ultium-built EVs, including the Silverado EV, Blazer EV, and Equinox EV.

“We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt”

“We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt,” Cody Williams, senior manager for communications at Chevy, said in a statement. “We will share details as we get closer to its launch date. As we’ve said before, the new Bolt will build on the formula that has made it a success today.”

Joining them in 2025 will be the Bolt EUV, which is slightly longer and comes with more cargo space than the Bolt EV. The differences are pretty slight: the 2022 Bolt EUV is about nine inches longer than the Bolt EV but basically the same height and width. The Bolt EUV has 97 cubic feet of passenger volume and 16 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, while the Bolt EV has 93.9 cubic feet of passenger space and 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats.

First introduced in 2016, the Chevy Bolt EV was intended to be the automaker’s first stab at a mass-market, battery-electric vehicle with 200-plus miles of range and an affordable price tag. The company released a refreshed model, as well as a slightly larger EUV version, in early 2021.

But thanks to Tesla’s dominance in the EV market, sales of the Bolt EV and EUV were pretty anemic for several years. This year has been one of the Bolt’s best sales years yet, with record sales in the second quarter across multiple markets.",technology
"The Samsung Galaxy S23 line came to market back in February 2023, so it's high time we looked ahead to what the Samsung Galaxy S24 (and its siblings) might bring to the mobile table next year.

Naturally, we’re still a couple of months away from the release of the Samsung Galaxy S24 line, but we’ve nonetheless put together this one-stop guide to all the latest news and rumors surrounding Samsung’s next Galaxy S phones.

Latest news The first spy shots of the Galaxy S24 Ultra's titanium body may have just leaked, showing design differences with the S23 Ultra.

Could land on January 17

There might not be a Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus

Samsung debuted its Galaxy S23 phones at Galaxy Unpacked in February, with the Galaxy S23, S23 Plus and S23 Ultra all going on sale from February 17. The Samsung Galaxy S22 range was revealed around the same time a year prior, so we’d expect next year’s Galaxy Unpacked event – which will likely fall in either January or February – to play host to the launch of the Galaxy S24 line.

So far, all the Samsung Galaxy S24 release date rumors point to January, so that's probably the most likely month. Some have got more specific, with one source claiming the Galaxy S24 will land in mid-to-late January, and the most recent Samsung Galaxy S24 release date rumors pointing to January 17.

We've heard that date twice now, with a second source additionally claiming that pre-orders for the Samsung Galaxy S24 will open on January 18, and the phone will ship by January 30.

It’s worth noting that we don’t yet know whether Samsung will again release three Galaxy models in the S24 line – a vanilla S24, an S24 Plus and a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The company has stuck with a three-pronged release strategy every year since 2020, but The Elec reports that Samsung may be preparing to ditch the Plus variant due to “polarization in the flagship product market” and the “stagnation of the entire smartphone market”. Though we've elsewhere heard that the Plus is still planned.

Samsung Galaxy S24: price

Likely to be upwards of $799.99 / £849 / AU$1,349

Prices might be similar to last year

The Ultra could cost more than the S23 Ultra

We haven't heard much about Samsung Galaxy S24 pricing, but using this year’s Galaxy S23 phones as a marker, though, we can safely assume that the vanilla S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra will cost at least $799.99 / £849 / AU$1,349, $999.99/ £1,049 / AU$1,649, and $1,199.99 / £1,249 / AU$1,949, respectively.

Indeed, one Galaxy S24 price leak points to prices remaining similar to the current models.

However, one older leak points to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra costing even more than the S23 Ultra, so you'd better get saving.

Samsung Galaxy S24: colors

We've heard a few rumors concerning potential Samsung Galaxy S24 colors, with the first coming from serial Samsung leaker Ross Young.

According to the tipster, the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus and Galaxy S24 Ultra will debut in four colors: Black, Gray, Violet and Yellow. As with the Samsung Galaxy S23, it’s likely that Samsung will make additional color options available exclusively through Samsung.com, and Ross Young claims these will be orange, light blue, and light green.

We've now heard that exact same selection also mentioned by leaker @UniverseIce, who has a fairly respectable track record.

Another big leak suggests that those indeed will be the colors that we're going to see, and that the same colors will be available with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra – only they'll have slightly different names.

For comparison, the Galaxy S23 line shipped in Phantom Black, Green, Lavender and Cream, while the Samsung Galaxy S22 shipped in Bora Purple, Phantom White, Green, Pink Gold and Phantom Black.

If Young’s claim rings true, the Galaxy S24 will mark the first yellow Samsung phone since the Galaxy S10e, which launched in Canary Yellow back in 2019. But the Galaxy S24 might also mark the first Samsung phone since the Galaxy S9 to not be made available in white (the S23’s Cream is de facto white).

Samsung Galaxy S24: design and display

The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is expected to improve upon its predecessor's already impressive camera array (above) (Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)

Likely to have roughly the same screen sizes as last year

iPhone 15 Pro-style designs rumored for the S24 and S24 Plus

The S24 Ultra might have a slightly different camera layout

Assuming there are three models in the S24 line, you’ll likely have to decide between the Galaxy S24’s 6.1-inch display, the Galaxy S24 Plus's 6.6-inch one, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra’s 6.8-inch screen (that’s assuming these phones adopt the same display sizes as their respective predecessors.

That said, the standard and middle models might be marginally larger, at 6.17 inches and 6.65 inches, respectively, according to one Galaxy S24 Plus screen leak. The latter phone may also come with a WQHD display, meaning it could be closer to the S22 Ultra than the base S24.

Unless Samsung rocks the boat, we’d expect the vanilla model to stick with the S23’s 120Hz AMOLED display (2340 x 1080 pixels), with the S24 Plus and S24 Ultra sporting the S23 Ultra’s glorious dynamic AMOLED 2X panel (1440 x 3088 pixels), as well as its dynamic refresh rate that can scale between 1Hz and 120Hz. That might top out at 144Hz this time around though.

However, one leak suggests both the Samsung Galaxy S24 and the Galaxy S24 Plus will also be able to dynamically adjust their refresh rates between 1Hz and 120Hz. Their predecessors could only drop to 48Hz, so this would be a big upgrade, and could help improve battery life.

There's also talk of a new, more power efficient M13 OLED panel at work on at least the S24 Ultra, with scale of production dictating whether this more power efficient panel also gets used on the S24 and S24 Plus. Also on the screen front, we've heard that all three Galaxy S24 models might have a peak brightness of 2,500 nits, which would make them the brightest smartphone screens on the planet.

Since then, another source has echoed that brightness claim and also said that all three Samsung Galaxy S24 models will get an M13 screen.

Intriguingly, the actual look of the phones may be very different to what we’re used to. Samsung recently hired Hubert H. Lee, a former design executive at Mercedes-Benz, to lead its smartphone and smartwatch design department from 2023 and beyond, so the S24 and S24 Ultra may veer away from recent Galaxy S models in terms of aesthetics.

Indeed, several leaks point to design changes for the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus, with both phones reportedly in line for smaller bezels. They're rumored to be getting slightly flatter edges, too, following the lead of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and, ironically, the iPhone 15 Pro. Recent Galaxy S24 render leaks (below) seemingly corroborate this.

We've also seen renders of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus with a similar design, and of the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with no real changes other than smaller bezels, some of which can also be seen below. Leaked dummy units of the Galaxy S24 and Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus also show the same design as these renders.

That said, another leak suggests that actually the Samsung Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus will look identical to their predecessors, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra will only have a slightly tweaked camera layout. Another still says the S24 Ultra could flatten out its display and join the S24 and S24 Plus, leaving curved displays in the past.

We've seen leaked case images too, which also show all three Samsung Galaxy S24 models with near identical designs to their predecessors.

We've also heard though that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra might use titanium for its frame, rather than the aluminum of its predecessor. Titanium is stronger relative to its weight, but also more expensive.

The same source has since made this claim again, though specifying that the Galaxy S24 Ultra will use a titanium alloy, and that it will apparently weight 233g. That's 1g less than the S23 Ultra, and if the change in frame material is the main factor affecting the weight then that's likely to mean the S24 Ultra will be substantially stronger than its predecessor.

Another source (The Elec) also points to a titanium frame for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, and one leaker actually claims that all three Samsung Galaxy S24 phones will ship with iPhone 15 Pro-style titanium sides, but since this rumor contradicts reports from other prominent tipsters, we'd suggest taking it with a pinch of salt for now, even if newly-leaked spy shots of a supposed S24 Ultra apparently show the titanium frame off up close.

Perhaps the most comprehensive leak regarding the design of these phones has come from Windows Report, and we can see minimal changes from the Galaxy S23 handsets, as well as the colors that the handsets will be available in.

Samsung Galaxy S24: camera and battery

Largely the same camera hardware as last year has been rumored

The Galaxy S24 Ultra might have some upgrades to its 10x telephoto

The Ultra might have a 50MP telephoto camera

As for the phone’s cameras, tipster Ice Universe claimed that Samsung would replace the S23 Ultra’s telephoto sensor with a “new solution” on the S24 Ultra, while the phone’s main camera “will remain the same.”

The Galaxy S24 Ultra is expected to replace the telephoto sensor and adopt a new solution. I think the main camera will remain the same or be slightly changed.December 28, 2022 See more

More recently, another tweet from RGcloudS suggests the S24 Ultra will adopt a “Gen4 optics” zoom camera design to “significantly improve” the phone’s zoom capabilities.

In practice, that could mean a wider 2.5-2.9 aperture and the possibility of 150x digital zoom on the S24 Ultra, which would offer better low-light performance than its predecessor and trump the latter’s already impressive 100x Space Zoom capabilities.

We've elsewhere heard that these upgrades could mean a variable telephoto camera, which can move between 3x optical zoom and 10x. It's not totally clear whether it would be able to optically zoom to levels between those two (such as 5x) or just to those two levels though. Either way, it would mean only one telephoto lens is needed rather than two.

Disappointingly though the same source has since said that while this feature was planned, it now won't be happening, and that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will have the same cameras as the S23 Ultra, other than ""minor improvements"" to the 10x zoom lens. That would mean a 200MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide, a 10MP 3x telephoto and likely a 10MP 10x telephoto.

They also add that apparently the standard Galaxy S24 and Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus will have the same 50MP main camera as their predecessors.

That said, another source claims that Samsung will use a 1-inch sensor in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. This would allow more light in, likely improving low light shots and dynamic range. However, the source doesn't have much of a track record, so we're skeptical.

Indeed, Ice Universe – who was one of the original sources pointing to a variable optical zoom – has since returned with detailed camera specs from ""Korean sources"" and they don't include either a variable zoom or a 1-inch sensor.

In fact, they're exactly the same specs as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has, including exactly the same sensors, with the only different being a '+' version of one of the sensors being used instead, which they claim makes for a ""negligible"" improvement.

But in a more recent leak, the same source has said the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra will have a new 50MP 3x zoom telephoto camera, which is at odds with their claim above.

Another source has echoed this 50MP camera claim, but said the other cameras will all have the same megapixel numbers as on the Galaxy S23 Ultra.

More recently still, @UniverseIce has returned with the claim that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra won't have a 10x optical zoom at all, which sounds very unlikely, since this is a key feature of the line. That said, other sources have since backed this up, pointing to a 5x optical zoom instead, though the Galaxy S24 Ultra might still have 100x digital zoom.

So the leaks are a bit all over the place, but most of them now point to minimal camera changes for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra at least, with less known about the cameras on the other models.

When it comes to the selfie camera, it looks like there won't be any change: we'll get a 12MP camera again, and no under-display technology. Once upon a time the Ultra model got an upgraded selfie camera, but not any more.

Beyond the hardware, the cameras might get an AI upgrade, as Samsung has applied for trademarks for Magic Pixel, Flex Magic and Flex Magic Pixel, which sound like photo editing features.

As for the battery, that might see improvements, with a report claiming that Samsung is working on an electric-vehicle style battery for smartphones.

This would use a stacked rather than rolled design, allowing for 10% greater capacity in the same space. Though whether this will be ready in time for the Galaxy S24 is less clear.

We've also seen a certification pointing to a 4,900mAh battery in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus and a 5,000mAh one in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. That would mean a slight upgrade for the Plus model, as the S23 Plus was 4,700mAh, but no change for the Ultra.

Those same specs have been mentioned elsewhere, with the source adding that the standard Samsung Galaxy S24 will have a 4,000mAh battery, making it 100mAh bigger than the S23.

We've also heard 5,000mAh mentioned again for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, along with 45W charging, which is the same charging power as the S23 Ultra.

More recently, another certification has emerged, which also mentioned 45W charging for the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, as well as for the Galaxy S24 Plus, but said the standard Samsung Galaxy S24 would be limited to 25W. Those are all identical speeds to the previous models.

Samsung Galaxy S24: specs and features

Expect an extremely powerful new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset

Samsung might have an exclusive 'for Galaxy' version of the chipset

Might use an Exynos 2400 in some regions or models

More baseline RAM than the last few generations

Under the hood, the phones will probably be running Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chipset, which looks set to be the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 come 2024.

That said, some regions might get an Exynos 2400 instead, which will probably be slightly less powerful. Alternatively, Samsung might equip the standard Galaxy S24 with an Exynos 2400, while the Plus and Ultra models get a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Another report has also claimed the S24 Ultra would be equipped with the 8 Gen 3 in all regions, strengthening the possibility of that being the case.

In any case, every model in the Galaxy S23 line runs on a bespoke version of Qualcomm’s already impressive Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, so the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 versions of the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra are sure to be even more powerful handsets than their predecessors. The Exynos models likely will be too, but perhaps not to the same extent.

Indeed, a leak suggests that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 will be significantly faster than the 8 Gen 2, and new benchmark scores for both the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Ultra seemingly confirm as much.

Per a Geekbench listing, Samsung’s next base model achieves a single-core of 2,051 and a multi-core score of 6,204. In our own testing, the Samsung Galaxy S23 achieved benchmark scores of 1,855 and 4,903, so it’s safe to expect tangible performance improvements from the former phone.

Similarly, Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, achieves a single-core score of 2,214 and a multi-core score of 6,744. In our own testing, the iPhone 15 Pro Max achieved benchmark scores of 2,935 and 7,207, respectively, while the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra achieved scores of 2,011 and 5,365, respectively.

We've also heard that the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra might come with up to 2TB of storage (which is double what the S23 Ultra has), and that the 256GB model might have 12GB of RAM. Though, oddly, this source also claims that there's a chance of a 128GB/8GB model, despite the S23 Ultra starting at 256GB.

Contradicting the quoted memory above, however, the same industry sources that stated the Ultra (and possibly the other S24 models) will get an M13 OLED display also claim that the baseline amount of RAM might increase across the board; with the standard Galaxy S24 starting at 12GB (rather than the current 8GB) and a jump to 16GB for the S24 Ultra.

We've heard a similar but not identical leak elsewhere, with one source claiming the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus will start at 128GB/8GB, but that there will also be a 256GB/12GB model, and that all Galaxy S24 Ultra models will have 16GB of RAM.

Similarly, a benchmark points to 12GB of RAM and an Exynos 2400 chipset in the Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, which would make for a RAM upgrade but an undesirable chipset.

Most recently on the RAM front, it's been reported that the Samsung Galaxy S24 will have just 8GB, and the S24 Plus and Ultra will come in both 8GB and 12GB configurations.

We've also heard that the Samsung Galaxy S24 series could heavily feature AI, with one source describing the Galaxy S24 as an 'AI phone', and Samsung itself now applying to trademark 'AI Phone' and 'AI Smartphone'.

Samsung also recently announced its first on-device large language model (LLM), Samsung Gauss, and it would make sense for the Galaxy S24 to be the first Samsung phone that features these new AI capabilities. In fact, a recent Korea Times report suggests that Samsung Gauss will indeed debut on the Samsung Galaxy S24 line, so we're excited to see what this LLM brings to the mobile table.

That said, one source suggests that the Galaxy S24's AI skills could require a subscription.

Finally, Samsung might swap from Google to Bing for its default search engine on devices, which is sure to please Microsoft and almost no one else. Then again, a more recent report says this won't be happening.",technology
"But not long after, Wilcox had some bad days of his own.

A month after the office’s unveiling, it had to respond to its first mass shooting, in Lewiston, Maine. Then another one in Chicago. They’re just two of the 630 mass shootings so far this year.

“The gun violence that is happening is unacceptable,” Wilcox said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine. “The truth is that we have a lot of ground to make up.”

Biden can claim credit for signing the first gun safety law in nearly 30 years and has issued a slew of executive orders, but he’s also been criticized by progressives for not doing more. The new White House office was a long-sought goal of gun safety activists, who were eager for further action from the administration, particularly with new legislation all but doomed in Congress amid Republican resistance.

Despite the ongoing carnage, including a tragedy that hit Wilcox’s own family, he remains optimistic that America can tackle this growing crisis. And he made the case that the federal government is building new systems right now that might actually stem the bloodshed.

“Gun violence is rooted in heartbreak,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean it’s rooted in hopelessness.”

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Your office’s name includes the word “prevention.” Did you expect that responding to, rather than preventing, mass shootings would play such a big role in your job?

The president gave us four clear tasks: The first is to expedite the implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the previous executive actions. The second is to identify new executive actions that we can take to reduce gun violence. A third is to expand the coalition of partners that we work with to get more state and local action. And then the fourth is to improve the support for our communities and individuals impacted by gun violence.

And it’s not just mass shootings, it’s concentrations and surges in gun violence. And so was I surprised? No, absolutely not. But my fellow deputy, Greg Jackson, had been working on developing the first-ever, whole-of-government response to gun violence when it occurs even before that shooting [in Lewiston] and so he was well prepared to lead the largest federal response ever to an act of gun violence.

And that’s a system for how federal agencies can jump into action in the event of another shooting?

Exactly. Since we knew this was our job from the jump, we had already worked with the agencies to begin to understand what potential resources they could bring to bear to respond to gun violence. When that tragedy happened in Lewiston, we were just forced into action. That system only gets perfected over time, especially as we look back at lessons learned. We hear more about needs, and we develop a real comprehensive response plan.

The thing that we know is that no shooting is the same. Part of the art of the challenge is not to apply a cookie cutter formula to every incident, but to be thorough with the tools that could be brought to bear so we can be adaptable to what the situation demands.

Do you have specific examples of what this looked like in Lewiston?

My fellow deputy was on the ground within a couple of days — there was obviously a delay since it was an ongoing [manhunt]. We were able to bring multiple agencies to the scene so that we could support the kids that are going back to school and the principals that are dealing with the fallout; the Veterans Affairs Department working with the veterans community; directly addressing the needs of the deaf community, which was specifically impacted in this shooting; and working with the Chamber of Commerce on support for small businesses.

We really were bringing federal resources to bear in a coordinated fashion that just never had been activated like this before.

Is there anything that you learned from this response?

Look, I think the things that we learned are some of the things that Greg and I have always known. The pain and the trauma lasts longer than a news cycle. Families of individuals who are shot live with that the rest of their lives. Parents that lose children will never recover. And communities live with that reverberation of trauma for years and years, if not their entire lives.

What we’ve been able to bring is that perspective to this office, so that the systems that we put in place and the interventions that we support are meant for healing and helping those that are closest to this pain. And it’s not just about mass shootings. It’s about gun violence in all its forms, about domestic violence, about community violence. It’s about suicide. It’s about accidental shootings.

How does your office play a role in coming up with new ideas for executive actions, and should we expect any new policy moves soon?

Yeah, we’ve been working around the clock, and there is so much support in this administration for taking action. Our job is about focusing the efforts of this administration. There are several offices and dozens of agencies that all have specific pieces to address this problem. But the issue is, when you have multiple people attacking the same issue, you can see silos. You can see things happening in parallel, but not with strategic coordination. And so we are a dedicated office that acts as that coordinator.

Both you and Jackson bring experience as not only advocates, but as survivors of gun violence. How has this informed your work?

For example, when it came to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we knew that one of the purposes was to implement extreme risk protection order laws and red flag laws. We could dive in and immediately assess the progress in terms of where that funding was and how it was getting to the states. And we convened the states very quickly, to encourage them to get their plans in so that they can begin accessing this money and spending it on the implementation of these red flag laws. Because at the end of the day, we know that these are the types of laws that can save lives because after way too many of these incidents everyone’s saying, “I saw the flag.”

That’s literally the reason my cousin isn’t here today. The man who killed her was in the middle of a mental health crisis that his brother wanted to take action on. He tried some things, but there was no tool at that time to get the guns out of his brother’s hands, even though he wanted to. So that guy walked into the mental health hospital where my cousin was just volunteering for winter break from Haverford College and he shot and killed her and others.

I still today can picture the funeral. I can see where people were sitting. And you want to do something. You want to do something not just for your family, but the families that you don’t even know yet.

There’s obviously a lot of push and pull between policymakers and advocates. Have you disappointed any former colleagues yet in the advocacy world?

You’d have to ask them if they’re disappointed. Look, there’s no time for grace. There’s only time for the urgency of action. And I think people see that that’s how Greg and I move and that we are here to put in all the work and they know the reasons why we do it. And so I think we welcome all the ideas. We’re not shy, to say bring us the best ideas.

What’s been the biggest challenge?

The biggest challenge we face is that gun violence has continued. Some of the solutions that have been put in place are beginning to make a difference, and we’re seeing reductions in violent crime and homicide in our cities across this country.

But we still know that the gun violence that is happening is unacceptable, and the president has told us as much — that it doesn’t matter that we passed the first law in 30 years. It doesn’t matter that this administration has taken more executive actions than every other administration combined. What matters is that this gun violence is happening everyday. So I think that the challenge is that we don’t have a minute to spare.

A lot of people are losing hope. Many are scared to send their kids to school. What would you say to Americans who feel like gun violence is never going to end?

The truth is that we have a lot of ground to make up. We’ve had years of underinvestment in the community-based organizations that are doing the hard work on the ground, to intervene and stop violence before it starts — six years where the leading federal agency to enforce our gun laws was without a confirmed director. And we were 30 years from the last time that we had any advancement in our gun safety laws. So we’re just getting started at putting all those pieces into play.

Gun violence is rooted in heartbreak. But that doesn’t mean it’s rooted in hopelessness. In fact, it’s the opposite. And the truth is the 20 years I’ve been involved in this prove that to me. The NRA thought they were going to work out of the West Wing. Twenty years later, we’ve established the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

And in 2013, after a tragedy that captured the nation’s attention, we only got 54 votes in the U.S. Senate for a background check policy. And in 2022, after another tragedy at a school and a tragedy in Buffalo, we saw 65 votes in the U.S. Senate for a bill that included multiple interventions, not just when it comes to gun laws, but in mental health.

I see survivors and students and young people leading on this issue in ways they never had before. And so, I’m filled with hope.",political
"A UK-based System Integrator Chillblast product manager was caught stealing nearly $250,000 (£200,000) worth of PC hardware over several years and then selling it on Gumtree and eBay. The company's product manager, with the help of a former employee, pulled off the heist. Both were found guilty in court today, where they were awarded for their efforts with a jail term.

The dynamic duo sold up to thirty laptops, ten desktop systems, fifty graphics cards, and a large number of storage drives & monitors. The heist occurred during the pandemic and the bitcoin mining boom, so many of these components, especially the graphics cards, could have easily sold above retail pricing.

The Saga of a Seven-Year Embezzlement

Matthew Hudson, now obviously a former employee of the company, was in cahoots with a former employee, 32-year-old Daniel Key. Because he was able to exploit the trust of his colleagues due to his position and access to inventory checklists and customer returns, he was able to get away with it for seven years, from 2013 until 2019. Daniel Key helped Hudson sell these stolen goods and split the profits from their sales.

It took several years for the scheme to be uncovered, as Hudson was very good at hiding his tracks on paper until 2019. Hudson manipulated stock levels, stole items from custom returns, and made new items in the inventory unavailable by showing items as returned and credited. However, an employee spotted a special notebook only the company could have had in stock, listed for sale on Gumtree. Benedict Miles, Chillblast's managing director, was made aware of this. He got Key's address from the Gumtree listing and compared the product's serial number with his inventory list, and they matched.

The next day, Hudson was suspended but attempted a not-very-clean getaway by offering a resignation letter without prejudice and reimbursement for the stolen goods. Chillblast rejected the lowball offer and demanded the return of the work laptop. A Chillblast employee probed his laptop before the hard drive could be returned to him for privacy reasons, finding more incriminating evidence as it contained his phone backup, thus exposing the criminal operation.

Hudson and Key were arrested in 2019 but weren't charged by the police until 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other issues between the Crown Prosecution Service and the Dorset Police. Hudson was finally sentenced to jail for three years and eight months on December 7th. He'll serve half the sentence in prison while the remainder will be served on license (parole). On December 9th, his accomplice, Daniel Key, was sentenced to two years in prison after being found responsible for selling about £109,000 worth of stolen goods.

Though Key was unemployed, Mathew Hudson held a respectable position in the company until he was caught. The total estimated worth of the stolen goods is roughly $250,960, of which Daniel sold $136,773 worth of inventories. Assuming an even split between the two, he flushed his career for $182,570, which averages to about $26,082 over seven years.",technology
"President Joe Biden

Those iconic gold-rimmed Ray Ban Aviators are a big part of Biden’s brand. But that brand is in the toilet — just look at the poll numbers. Biden could use a makeover to squash chatter about his old age, and what better way to signal he’s still got it than by rocking the sunglasses that Gen-Zers are emptying their wallets for? He might even be able to “how do you do, fellow kids” his way into going viral — especially when K-pop fans start making “who wore it better” memes comparing the president to K-pop sensation Jennie, the lead singer of the girl group Blackpink who is often spotted in the same shades.

Vice President Kamala Harris

As she gets back out onto the campaign trail in 2024, Harris could have fun with a statement piece — like these knitwear bunny ears from her influencer step daughter Ella Emhoff. Emhoff and Harris share a passion for knitting, and while the bunny bonnet might be a little more fashion-forward than some swing-state voters are used to, at least the vice president can promote her strong family values on the campaign trail. Plus, who doesn’t have a strange knitted item from a relative in their closet somewhere?

Speaker Mike Johnson

The public is freaked out about Johnson and his son using an app that allows users to monitor one another’s phone activity to discourage the use of porn. We have a better solution: There’s no need for an anti-porn app if you don’t use a smartphone at all. Gift Johnson and his son a flip phone and free them from their censorship duties. Luckily there are an abundance of flip phones on the market these days since they are so trendy with Gen Z-ers looking to unplug.

Justice Clarence Thomas

What can you get the man who’s already been given everything — including a house for his mom, tuition for his grand-nephew and a huge RV? Here’s a thought: Due to explosive reports revealing the lavish gifts Thomas received from billionaire Harlan Crow (not including the RV — that was financed by Thomas’ pal Anthony Welters, who made his money in healthcare), the justice might have to skip his yearly visit to Crow’s luxurious private resort in the Adirondacks. But with this photo calendar of the mountains, he can at least reminisce about the good old days when lavish gifts weren’t scrutinized. The Supreme Court ethics code might not have a gift price limit, but just to be safe, we’ve picked a book under $20, which is the gift limit for employees of the executive branch.

Vivek Ramaswamy

At the Iowa State Fair earlier this year, Ramaswamy ended his chat with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ in rap form — specifically, with Eminem’s “Lose Yourself.” Maybe if he’d practiced more, he would have won her coveted endorsement, which instead went to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. No offense to Slim, but we think a MasterClass from Nas — specifically lesson No. 2, “Telling Your Life Story Through Music” — would help Ramaswamy lay down some bars that could score him some real political points.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley

Haley says her heels are “not for a fashion statement — they’re for ammunition.” Like most of the internet, we had no idea what that meant — until we found these shoes with gun-shaped heels. Haley is a known gun lover — 10 years ago, she flaunted a $575 Beretta she got for Christmas — so you can expect this gift to be a bull’s-eye.

Governor Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.)

There’s one foolproof way to beat the wearing-shoe-lifts-allegations: Find yourself some clear shoes. Unfortunately on the campaign trail — especially in the chilly states of Iowa and New Hampshire — it’s not exactly appropriate to wear flip-flops or sandals. A proper(-ish) alternative are these see-through penny loafers that are notably lift-less. These dress shoes might not convey the kind of cowboy mentality that DeSantis is attempting to cultivate, but they’ll give him something even more important: unimpeachable evidence that he’s just as tall as he says he is.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Tinfoil Hat ($4.59; assembly required)

What do you get for the guy who’s scared of everything? A roll of Reynolds Wrap standard aluminum foil, which can quickly be fashioned into a hat to protect from whatever conspiracy theory is firing up his campaign lately. Wearing it in public might not help his poll numbers — and it’s not exactly “Kennedy-esque” — but it will certainly make a fashion statement.

Dr. Cornel West

Ever the music buff, West has described his quixotic presidential run as “like jazz,” meaning that he’s up for improvisation. We’re all for staying light on your feet, but between leaving two political parties in the span of a few short months, switching campaign managers multiple times and currently relying on just four staffers to do the job of leading his campaign, he might want to tone down the spontaneity and introduce a little structure into his presidential run. These classical tunes would be a great start.

Former Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.)

It took all of three days after leaving Congress for self-described “Republican It Girl” George Santos to set up a Cameo account (which allows users to pay him for personalized video messages). His videos are already delighting the internet — one ended up in embattled New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez’s inbox, by way of Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman — but the production quality leaves quite a bit to be desired. If he’s spending all that money on botox and lip filler, he needs a ring light to make it all shine. Plus, it’ll come in handy when Santos inevitably films his audition tapes for reality TV after the Cameo cash from the holiday season dries up. For posterity’s sake, our bet is he ends up on The Masked Singer, but we can’t count out Dancing with the Stars.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.)

Sinema is a known wine lover: She interned in 2020 at Three Sticks Wines in Sonoma, California, while also serving as a senator, and she got embroiled in scandal after her campaign spent $1,180 at the very same winery. This particular bottle is a “bold, brawny red wine” from nearby Napa that also happens to carry the same label that some spurned Democrats have called her ever since she left the party in late 2022: Traitor.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.)

Coal in your stocking is usually the ultimate diss from Santa. But during his time in Congress, Manchin has made two things clear: He loves coal, and he loves West Virginia. This gift combines both and would serve as a reminder of all the ways he propped up his state’s coal industry while he reminisces during his retirement next year.

New York Mayor Eric Adams

In November, POLITICO found that Adams had attended over 80 events celebrating Turkey in his eight years as Brooklyn borough president. His consistent presence at Turkish events is particularly relevant in light of the FBI’s ongoing probe into whether Adams’ mayoral campaign conspired with members of the Turkish government and accepted illegal campaign contributions. Given that he has to be a little more quiet about his love for Turkey these days, why not slip him some Turkish sweets to snack on in the privacy of his own home? To boot, the scandal might help Adams learn some important lessons about any alleged temptations, just like Edmund learned when the White Witch gave him Turkish delights in the Chronicles of Narnia.

Former President Donald Trump

Let’s face it, the four-times indicted former president is going to need some incredible lawyers to escape a guilty verdict or two. But that kind of legal help is way outside the price range of most MAGA fans. So how do you let your persecuted hero know you don’t want to see him wearing orange? Send him a Monopoly “get out of jail free” keychain. It’s a cheap gift, though, so don’t be surprised if Trump asks you to throw in a few dollars toward his legal fees too, since he is bleeding money.",political
"YouTube has introduced a new moderation tool for creators that allows them to pause comments, preventing any new comments from being added to videos while preserving those that have already been posted. In a blog post published on Thursday, YouTube said the feature enables creators to “take a break from managing comments if they become overwhelming” and provides some flexibility over how comments are managed.

Before this update, YouTube creators only had two options for moderating what would otherwise be a complete commenting free-for-all: either hold comments for manual review before publishing them, or completely disable all comments on a video. YouTube says the Pause feature is rolling out now — we’ve asked the company for clarification on global availability and will update this story if we hear back.

YouTube’s existing comment moderation tools haved been renamed to make them easier to understand.

As part of its announcement, YouTube also renamed some of its existing moderation settings for easier comprehension. This means instead of being presented with options to “Hold potentially inappropriate comments for review” and toggle to “Increase strictness” — which is a lot to cram into any options menu — users will instead be given a simple choice between On, Pause, or Off. Enabling comments also toggles some optional moderation levels to choose from: None (completely unmoderated), Basic (which holds “potentially inappropriate” comments for review), Strict (which holds a broader range of comments for review), and Hold All.",technology
"First things first

McHenry said his top priority is to pass and enact legislation on cryptocurrency, data privacy and capital formation.

He said he’s working with House leadership to find floor time for landmark crypto bills that would revamp the digital asset powers of the SEC and CFTC and also set up a new legal pathway for stablecoins.

McHenry said his biggest challenge on the crypto bills is “politics.” He said Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who have pushed back on his proposals, are leaving consumers worse off.

“It’s just a question of getting enough floor time and focus from policymakers to see why we need market structure, why we need a definition, why we need regulators that are fully empowered and why that’s good for capital formation, why that’s good for consumer protection,” he said. “What we need is broader engagement. And on some of these policies, like with China and with digital assets, a significant challenge is education.”

McHenry said recent Treasury Department recommendations to bolster crypto anti-money laundering rules are “problematic.”

“But they’re showing that there is a need for congressional action to bring clarity here,” he said. “I welcome that, and I welcome the conversation on the proper approach and a balanced approach.”

In addition, McHenry is working with Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Select Committee on the CCP Chair Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) to hash out a compromise on how to police capital flows to China by the end of the first quarter.

McCaul and his allies are backing legislation that would restrict U.S. investment in certain sectors of China’s economy, including AI and quantum computing. McHenry wants to use company-specific sanctions instead.

He said he opposes McCaul’s bill.

“It’s a deeply flawed approach that limits American business and doesn’t actually have a strong effect against China,” he said.

Republicans on the other side, who are fighting for restrictions on outbound investment into China, say McHenry is outnumbered. But he’s not backing down.

“They thought they could roll me and say nasty things about me in the press and I would cave,” he said. “They can say nasty things if they wish, but that doesn’t make their policy good or effective.”

What’s next for Financial Services

McHenry is planning to tee up a series of additional oversight and legislative targets in the first quarter. January’s focus will be on “rogue regulators,” followed by work in February on “holding bad actors accountable” and a March emphasis on American competitiveness.

— “We’re going to start with a focus on rogue regulators from this administration: the capital rule, the Basel Endgame, the climate rulemaking and the regulatory agenda of the Securities and Exchange Commission.”

— “Then we’ll have a keen focus on AML-BSA policies and China’s abuse of the international finance system. So a lot of focus on OFAC and FinCEN and how we enforce sanctions, how we carry out economic statecraft and how we protect against money laundering at home.”

— “Then we want to pivot into how we enhance our competitiveness. That too entails the Basel Endgame, the rulemaking of the administration and also what we seek to do to make the economy better” via policy.

The “opening act” will have a heavy emphasis on oversight but legislation is also planned, including on sanctions and anti-money laundering rules.

Why now?

When asked why he’s retiring, McHenry said it’s been a “key year in my service in Congress” and a “helluva ride,” after being a central player in electing a speaker and then temporarily serving in the post himself. He also cited GOP committee term limits, which mean he wouldn’t be able to keep serving as the Financial Services committee’s top Republican after 2024 without seeking a waiver.

“Republican term limits are impactful and matter, and they’re good for the institution and for the Republican conference,” he said. “It’s a net win. In my circumstance, I knew that was the deal going in.”

“I’m not down on the institution in any way,” he added.

What he’ll do after leaving office

"石川 確かに、トップダウンとボトムアップは都市開発における長年の争点です。ただ、大切なのはそのどちらも行き来できることであり、わたしたちはその中間者や媒介者としての役割を担うことが求められていると考えています。近年は経済性などの定量的な指標にとどまらない、定性的な街や都市の評価軸の重要性が叫ばれていますし、わたしたちの活動も数値化されにくい街のミクロな営みや文化、風景のなかに価値を見出していくものです。とはいえ、その定性的な価値というのは非常に判断しにくいという側面もあります。

──だからこそ、数値はステークホルダー間でわかりやすいコミュニケーションの媒介となるわけですね。

杉田 長期的視点に立てばこそ、定性的な価値を、数値や言語で定量化することの意義が増すと思っています。例えば、わたしたちが大丸有地区（大手町・丸の内・有楽町）で開催しているアーバニストのための学びと実践の場「URBANIST CAMP TOKYO」では、都市における人間と人間以外の生き物との共生を考える「リワイルディング（再野生化）」をテーマに、調査・実践・検証の3つのフェーズごとに今後約半年間にわたって活動する予定です。その検証フェーズでは、アカデミアや専門家の参加のもとで価値を評価し、企業や行政にもわかりやすいかたちで定量的／言語的に翻訳することを目指します。経済性だけにとらわれない定量的な指標づくりをし、それが大規模開発においても説得可能な材料となる指標になればと思っての取り組みです。

石川 理想は市民一人ひとりが都市を主体的に楽しみながら生活する「アーバニスト」として都市にかかわれる状態があることですが、その実現には時間がかかります。長い時間軸で考えないと、都市の価値は判断できません。すべてを定量的な評価軸に押し込めてしまうのではなく、双方の視点からステークホルダーに伝えていける評価軸をつくっていけたらと思っています。

杉田 建築家の隈研吾さんはかつて、「発酵するムラ」というキーワードを用いて「ある日コミュニティに酵母菌がやってきたとき、うまく発酵できるか、腐ってしまうかは環境次第である」と語っていました。わたしたちの役割は、外から何かを持ち込んだり、そのときに社会の“発酵”、つまり熟成や変化がうまく進むような環境を整える媒介者となったりすることなのではないかと思っています。

──ハイパーローカルをグローバルに考えていくことも活動の軸に据えていますよね。

石川 はい。わたしたちは短期滞在か長期滞在かにかかわらず、それぞれの地域に何かしらのアイデアや視点を残していくことを目指してきました。例えば神戸市のプロジェクトでは、for Citiesのチームも長期滞在しながら“よそ者”としてリサーチを進めますし、来年はクライアントとともにベトナムを訪れることも予定しています。また、日本も含めたアジア各国のプロジェクトで出会ったアーバニストたちを短期間アーバニスト・イン・レジデンスとして招き、アイデアを交換し合いながら、滞在中に作品やプロジェクトを残してもらいました。これまでのまちづくりは、担い手が居住者や長期滞在者に固定化していた側面もあるので、よりオープンなかかわり合いの可能性を常に模索しています。

"The music switches from soft elevator tunes to Usher, signaling that the day’s events are about to begin. Brother Sinclair Skinner, the Summit’s cofounder, enters the auditorium, and the stragglers in the room snap to order. Skinner is one of those people who’s never met a stranger in his life. He’s wearing his usual “I ♥️ Black People” T-shirt—it’s his version of a black turtleneck. His cat-eye glasses, lenses tinted pink, are giving Clark Kent meets P-Funk Mothership. He says a few words of welcome, and we stand up to receive libations from Priest Nana Akua N. Zenzele: “Bless us abundantly. We ask that you continue to support our people in this blockchain summit and that we are supported in using this technology throughout the world.” We sing along to a Howard student’s beautiful rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

I’m here as a nonbeliever. I worry that the Black-utopian narrative of a crypto-fied future leaves out how many of us will survive to the end of the story. With Skinner onstage, though, my mood swivels toward optimism. It helps that he’s an unusually credible narrator: a Howard alum, with a storied history in organizing protests on that campus and for the 1995 Million Man March, as well as forming the first Black super PAC for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. He was turned on to crypto when he helped organize a DC Occupy encampment and saw how a Bitcoin wallet was used to distribute resources. In 2017, he launched the remittance company BillMari by embarking on a bus tour of historically Black colleges and universities, spreading the gospel of this new tech to young Black minds. The tour ended in Zimbabwe, where it was abruptly stopped by the uprising against Robert Mugabe. (“When people tell their startup launch stories, I say mine included a coup,” Skinner tells me later. “If you can’t top that, I’m not impressed.”) The idealistic ethos of crypto—anarcho-populist protest meets decentralized network, as Skinner saw it—convinced him it could be a way to build a pan-African movement.

The next year, in 2018, Skinner created the Black Blockchain Summit to hash out with other Bitcoin disciples, currency creators, artists, and government reps what the future could look like for Black communities globally. This was during crypto’s early wave, when Nipsey Hussle was evangelizing the digital revolution. Then, as the market inflated, scams proliferated, and Black investors started to get crowded out, Skinner envisioned the summit as a “safety net” by which Black people could learn from and protect one another. He still sees it that way. When I ask him what he thinks of the FTX crash, he replies that no one should be surprised. The company’s founder may have used the language of altruism, but “it’s still the same white elites moving money around,” he says. What about the risks for the average investor? Skinner acknowledges that crypto is a gamble—but the promise of the future it might deliver seems, to him, magnitudes better than sticking to the status quo. When you have nothing to lose, and no sign that TradFi or Silicon Valley will show up for Black people, gambling on crypto starts to look like a necessity.

Crypto holds a certain appeal for Black people. Black Americans are significantly more likely to invest in cryptocurrency than white Americans and to buy crypto as their first investment. A definitive picture of the current moment is hard to capture, but last year an estimated 25 percent of Black Americans owned cryptocurrency; for those under 40 years old the portion jumped to 38 percent. At the same time, Black people are significantly less likely than white people to think of cryptocurrencies as risky. They are about twice as likely to believe, falsely, that cryptocurrency is both safe and regulated by the government—a perception helped by Black celebrities paid to lend cultural cred to white-led crypto companies.

All this might start to form a picture of a Black populace that is uniquely vulnerable to crypto’s deceptions. But the Black Blockchain Summit insists on troubling this assumption. As the debris settles from last year’s crash, the energy in this room continues to be bullish. I want to know: What’s left to buy into?",technology
"College leaders have faced intense scrutiny as they’ve attempted to navigate competing pressures on campus, and critics on both sides of the issue and in both parties say they’re failing.

Lawmakers have slammed university officials over their responses, with Republicans taking aim at the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania at a House Education Committee hearing Tuesday. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has launched more than a dozen investigations into incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia in schools since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks roiled campuses across the country.

Volokh, who helms the popular “Volokh Conspiracy” blog now housed at the libertarian Reason Magazine, said he thinks college officials should more often just keep their mouths shut.

“It’s not our job to opine on, or to even express horror, at horrible things,” he said.

Protests over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on college campuses are nothing new, but the war has clearly heightened the long-simmering tension. And now college leaders are stuck playing referee over what might be considered legitimate pro-Palestinian advocacy and what’s discrimination against Jewish people.

The Education Department is expected to soon come out with its own answer in a long-delayed regulation that Jewish civil rights groups say should make clear when a university must intervene in antisemitic or Islamophobic incidents. The proposal could closely align with former President Donald Trump’s executive order, which threatened to pull federal funding from colleges that ignore antisemitism on campus.

Clarifying Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to say it protects against discrimination based on national origin could be useful, Volokh said, but restricting how people speak about Israel on campus could set a “very dangerous” precedent for universities.

He also discussed what he called “censorship envy,” and why activists on the left may soon decide they’re not as eager to curb so-called “hate speech” after all.

This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

The First Amendment is one of your main areas of expertise as a legal scholar, and you’re a big free speech proponent. How do you feel about the climate on free speech, amid fierce debate over pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses?

I’m worried that there is pro-Palestinian speech being suppressed. I’m worried that there’s some pro-Israeli speech being suppressed. I also think that there are some things that are being too much tolerated.

When there are demonstrations where people take over some school building or something like that, that’s not protected speech. I think that should be quickly stopped and punished. And that’s true whether it’s pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel.

College leaders have been lambasted for their response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. How should they respond to campus protests, rallies and demonstrations?

I think the optimal response for college leaders ought to be: We’re happy to talk about things that are happening at our university. When it comes to things that are happening in the world at large — even utterly atrocious things — it’s not our job, that’s not what we get paid for. It’s not our job to opine on, or to even express horror, at horrible things. Horrible things happen all the time in this world.

But many universities have recently spoken out on a wide range of topics: the killing of George Floyd, abortion, and about a variety of other subjects. So now, the view of some is OK, one Black man is killed by a police officer in America and you speak out, perfectly fine. You’re entitled to speak out. But 1,200 Jews, including some Americans, are murdered in a deliberate attack in Israel by Hamas, and you keep mum now?

A major debate taking place on Capitol Hill is the question of “hate speech” and “speech you hate.” How would you draw that line? How should Congress be handling this discussion differently?

As a First Amendment matter, there is no line to draw because “hate speech” is not a First Amendment term.

Now, some people have been trying to push back on that. They say certain viewpoints should be banned by the government; either people should go to jail for expressing those viewpoints or they should be fined or sued, or they should be expelled from public universities. Those people do have to try to explain when is criticism of Israel antisemitic and therefore hate speech. Or anti-Israeli and therefore presumably hate speech based on national origin. And when is it just criticism of the government of the State of Israel.

You could argue, well, we need to draw a line between this speech and other speech. Then the line becomes very difficult to draw up. One possibility is that some people on the left, who both have campaigned for somewhat more restrictions on supposed hate speech and who support the Palestinian cause and who are sharply critical of Israel, maybe they’re going to reconsider.

Maybe they’re going to say, “Wait a minute. If we allow suppression of hate speech, we see already that the pro-Israeli forces are using that as a tool to suppress anti-Israel advocacy. So, maybe we ought to agree with Justice [William] Brennan and Justice [Thurgood] Marshall and other leading liberal justices of the past who refused to come up with a hate speech exception and see that it’s actually important to protect speech. Otherwise, our own speech might be next on the chopping block.”

The presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn will testify before the House Education Committee about their response to the war. To what extent are university presidents able to claim First Amendment protections for allowing demonstrations on campus in support of Palestinian people that lawmakers and Jewish students have found objectionable? Is this different for private universities?

Private universities are not bound by the First Amendment because the First Amendment only applies to government action. Now, a lot of private universities have essentially said we protect the free speech of our students, even though we don’t have to.

Public institutions are directly constrained by the First Amendment. If a public university wants to punish a student because of his support for Hamas, let’s say speech saying “Hamas was right, Hamas is justified in killing Israeli civilians.” That would be unconstitutional. It can’t punish students for their viewpoints, whether those viewpoints are seen as hateful or pro-murder or otherwise.

The University of California and Berkeley Law are being sued over claims of allowing antisemitism to go unchecked on campus. Berkeley says pro-Palestinian demonstrations are examples of free speech and they’ve permitted “Zionists” to be excluded from clubs by saying that’s based on student viewpoints not religious discrimination. As a professor at UCLA, how do you think the U.C. system has handled demonstrations? And is this First Amendment argument from Berkeley valid?

I haven’t looked closely at that particular complaint, but I can say generally, the University of California has to allow antisemitism on campus in the form of antisemitic advocacy.

Even if you completely persuade some judge, “Yes, this criticism of Israel is antisemitic.” The judge’s reaction has to be, “OK, University of California is bound by the First Amendment. It can’t suppress criticism just because it’s antisemitic.”

On the other hand, a university does have a duty to protect its students from violence. For example, if the university has allowed antisemitic violence or antisemitic vandalism while coming down hard on other kinds, then in that case, that might be discrimination based on their being Jewish — that they’re not being protected where other students are being protected.

The Education Department has launched several civil rights investigations into colleges and K-12 schools over alleged antisemitism or Islamophobia. What’s your sense on whether that’s a good idea or if they risk impinging on free speech?

If all this reflects is they have a complaint, well, presumably they can’t just ignore the complaints. If the opening of the investigation is simply, “OK, somebody made an accusation, then we need to at least have a look at it and see if this is a legit accusation that is legally adequate.” And on top of that, maybe investigate the facts to see if the facts support it.

The department is also expected this month to unveil a regulation that would specifically make discrimination based on national origin or shared ancestry illegal. A previous executive order by President Donald Trump included the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, which included denying Israel’s right to exist. Are you concerned that could be a First Amendment issue for campuses?

There are two very separate things potentially in play here. One has to do with this question of whether discrimination against Jews is prohibited by Title VI.

Title VI only bans discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color or national origin. It doesn’t cover religion. Why? Because there are universities that routinely discriminate based on religion with some religious universities. Because of that, Title VI doesn’t ban discrimination based on religion.

So some questions have arisen, does it even ban discrimination against Jews? And generally the federal government has said, well, yes, it does, because discrimination against Jews, likewise discrimination against certain Muslim groups, is really discrimination against a kind of national group, a kind of ethnic group. There’s been talk of making that clear.

There’s a separate question, though, of whether the government should adopt this International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism. That would pose very, very serious First Amendment problems.

To the extent that there are attempts to try to restrict antisemitic speech or classifications imposed by universities by working in anti-Israel sentiment into that category, that would make it essentially very dangerous for universities to tolerate certain kinds of criticism of Israel — criticism that is constitutionally protected — and that the federal government, I think, has no business trying to suppress.

In fact, there is a Department of Education decision in a case involving Rutgers, under the Trump administration, that seemed to adopt the IHRA definition. And I sharply criticized it. I think that that would be a very serious suppression of speech. Even though it would be a way of trying to pressure universities, including private universities, it would be the government imposing such pressure and that should be restrained by the First Amendment.

Stepping back a bit, how worried are you that free speech rights are going to be permanently curtailed because of the fallout from the Israel-Hamas war?

I am worried. I think to the extent that people do conclude, “Yes, this speech is beyond the pale, we have to suppress this kind of speech,” and that it’s legitimate for the government to suppress this kind of speech or for private universities that have before endorsed broad free speech rights… I think it would be very dangerous.

There’s a phenomenon I call “censorship envy,” which I think we’re seeing a lot of here. It’s just a reflection of what I think is human nature. If somebody says things that I find really offensive, but everybody else has to deal with things that they find offensive, I can say, OK, fine, I’m just going to try to ignore this person or argue against them or just have to deal with it, because everybody has to deal with it.

But if I see that other groups have gotten speech that they dislike suppressed, then I think what kind of chump am I if I tolerate speech I dislike. I should get at least the kind of protection against offensive speech that other groups are getting. And I think we’re seeing that in a lot of arguments for suppressing the anti-Israel speech.

I’ve often made such arguments myself and said look, we should be as free to criticize Israel as any other country. And people say, well, in principle, we may agree with you Volokh, but we know what will happen if somebody criticizes Blacks or criticizes gays and lesbians or criticizes trans people or criticizes women.

Given that that kind of speech is effectively being suppressed in various ways, well, then we need to suppress speech that praises the murder of Jews as well. But once that happens there’s going to be all these calls for more exceptions. That does worry me.",political
"Santorum declined to say which campaigns they were. But in a primary defined by its low-polling also-rans, calling the former Pennsylvania senator would make sense.

“I’m the patron saint of all these guys who are looking for a longshot win, which is great,” said Santorum.

In a campaign where all of Donald Trump’s opponents are scrambling for evidence that they have a shot of overcoming his enormous lead, Santorum is a proof point. But the fact other candidates and their supporters bring him up is also a sign of just how desperate the race has become — with Trump’s rivals relying on a pre-Trump mindset of how politics works, back when the GOP did not revolve around a Trumpian gravitational pull.

“That was back when we all subscribed to this lane theory of politics, which Trump has sort of abandoned,,” said David Kochel, who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns in Iowa. Now, he said, the primary “has to do with personality and celebrity. He is the axis around which voters determine who they are.”

The outlines of Santorum’s unlikely victory are remarkable. In the lead-up to that year’s caucuses, Santorum ran just $23,000 worth of television ads. Much of his victory is credited to the385 town halls and speeches he gave while traveling the state’s highways in a silver 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup named “Chuck Truck,” after his Iowa aide Chuck Laudner.

Nearly twelve years later, you can still detect the hard edges of bitterness in Santorum’s voice as he talks about his effort.

“The story that you guys have never told, nor do I think you have any interest in telling — you certainly didn’t then — was some guy who lost his Senate race by 18 percent six years before the caucus, and went to Iowa in a truck and car all by himself and campaigned all over the state and spent less than a million dollars the entire campaign, and won the Iowa caucuses,” said Santorum, the buttoned-down conservative father of seven children. “Candidly, if I was a Democrat, I would be a hero in national politics. But because I am who I am, nobody ever knows that.”

Santorum recalls attending lonely events where just one caucus goer showed up — not much different from the crowds Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson are drawing now. Once, he trekked to a GOP headquarters in Montgomery County, in the southwestern corner of the state, where only the county party chair, Margaret Stoldorf, showed up. Thirty awkward minutes later, Stoldorf shuttled him to the nearby courthouse, introducing him around.

“It turned out that Margaret, who was not a supporter of mine that morning, became a supporter of mine, and we won Montgomery County,” Santorum said, realizing he didn’t need mega political rallies to win but just the right person to hear his message, and carry it elsewhere.

Santorum’s win is mostly forgotten because the result wasn’t immediately clear in the hours and days after the caucuses. Initially, Mitt Romney appeared to have won by eight votes. Some two weeks later, the Iowa GOP declared Santorum the winner. And, of course, he didn’t win his party’s nomination. “In order to clarify conflicting reports and to affirm the results released January 18 by the Republican Party of Iowa, Chairman Matthew Strawn and the State Central Committee declared Senator Rick Santorum the winner of the 2012 Iowa Caucus,” the state GOP’s statement read at the time.

Fast forward more than a decade, and a number of non-Trump campaigns are trying to emulate his approach. Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy biotech entrepreneur, has said he’ll do at least another 200 Iowa events before the caucuses. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday notched stops in each of Iowa’s 99 counties. Doug Burgum, the wealthy governor of North Dakota, is criss-crossing the state, too.

And campaigns are not only copying his example. They are invoking Santorum explicitly as evidence they have a shot. Senior officials from sputtering campaigns ranging from Ramaswamy’s to Mike Pence’s this year have all pointed to his come-from-behind victory as reason to believe, even as candidates not named Donald Trump languish 30 points or more behind the frontrunner.

“I always say that the real caucus and primary sprint doesn’t happen until after Thanksgiving. That’s just the way it’s always been,” said Mike Biundo, a senior adviser to Ramaswamy, who also served as a top aide to Santorum in 2012. “Rick Santorum was sitting at around 3 percent at this time.”

“Recall, Rick Santorum was at 5 percent in 2011,” Marc Short, a Pence senior adviser told reporters in the spin room following the Reagan Library Debate in Simi Valley, Calif., in September, attempting to explain away Pence’s low polling less than a month before his candidate would drop out.

Before the primary began — before it became clear that so many longshots would need a Santorum-like miracle in Iowa — Santorum says just one candidate in the 2024 field asked him for his opinion on the race: Pence, whose six-month campaign also leaned heavily on Iowa and hoped to replicate Santorum’s success. (Santorum said he advised Pence not to run: “Mike’s a really fine guy, and he’s a good friend. I just didn’t think this was the time for him to run. And I encouraged him to let this election pass.”)

That Santorum’s caucus victory is now getting more air is somewhat ironic. It happens, of course, in a year when Trump has so dominated the field that any jockeying in Iowa seems to be about who will finish second or third behind him. And ultimately, Santorum dropped out in April, before his home state of Pennsylvania voted. He did not win his party’s nomination; Romney did that.

At the moment, Santorum thinks Trump is going to win Iowa. But he doesn’t think it’s impossible that someone will catch him.

“If someone can catch fire at the end, there’s a chance for that landslide type of activity that I experienced,” he said, while en route back to Iowa for his role as a grassroots adviser to the Convention of the States, which champions an Article V gathering of the states to enact changes to the Constitution.

“I always say that I’m somewhat responsible for these huge Republican fields,” Santorum says, “because these guys say, ‘if Santorum can do it, anybody can.’”",political
"Microsoft has been gradually improving its built-in Notepad app on Windows 11 in recent years, and now, it’s finally getting a character count. In a new Canary channel test version of Windows 11, Microsoft has added the character count at the bottom much like Microsoft Word’s count of the number of words in a document.

“When text is selected, the status bar shows the character count for both the selected text and the entire document,” explains Microsoft’s Windows Insider team in a blog post. “If no text is selected, the character count for the entire document is displayed, ensuring you always have a clear view of your document’s length.”

This is the latest addition in a line of changes to Notepad this year, with the app recently getting a new autosave option that lets you close it without seeing the pop-up save prompt every time. Microsoft has also added tabs to Notepad, a dark mode, and even a virtual fidget spinner.

Alongside the Notepad changes in this latest Windows 11 test build, the widgets section of the OS is also getting some improvements. You’ll soon be able to just show widgets and hide the feed of news and articles that appear inside the widgets screen. I’m personally glad you’ll be able to hide this because it’s typically full of low-quality news articles and junk that I don’t want to see inside a built-in feature in Windows.",technology
"Digital health company Celero Systems is developing an electronic pill that can measure heart rate, breathing rate, and core temperature—from inside the human stomach. As a first step, the company envisions people with ongoing conditions using the digital capsule to monitor their vital signs at home. But in the future, they hope to use it as a kind of internal alarm system for drug-related overdoses.

In a small clinical trial published in November, the company tested the device on people with sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing occasionally stops and starts at night. To get a proper diagnosis, people often need to spend the night in a hospital, where they get covered in electrodes that measure their heart rate, breathing, muscle twitches, and brain activity: a comprehensive evaluation called polysomnography. This is a recipe for a crappy night’s sleep, whether you have apnea or not.

Patients can instead opt for an at-home test that involves wearing a breathing monitor on their finger overnight. But this can still cost hundreds of dollars, and it’s not always accurate. These wearables can’t measure respiration directly, just variations in heart rate presumably caused by breathing. But a pill inside the stomach can’t fall off, and it can measure lung movements internally.

Celero’s monitoring pill isn’t really a “pill” in the traditional sense—it’s a biocompatible plastic capsule, roughly the size of a big multivitamin, stuffed with tiny sensors, a microprocessor, a radio antenna, and batteries. Prior to working at Celero Systems, CEO Ben Pless primarily worked with medical implants, including one of the first implantable defibrillators. But ingestible devices, or digital pills, always intrigued him because, he says, “you could get inside the body without surgery.” Ingestibles offer many of the same benefits of implantables—they’re unobtrusive and you can’t forget to wear them—“except you implant it with a glass of water rather than a surgeon,” he says.

The capsule remains intact throughout its digestive system journey, keeping all of its electronics safely contained until it winds up in the toilet a couple of days later. Meanwhile, all the measurements are wirelessly transmitted to a laptop, where a researcher, doctor, or even the patient can access them. As far as Pless knows, Celero’s ingestible device is the first to monitor cardiac and respiratory activity in humans.

For the study, 10 sleep apnea patients at West Virginia University (WVU) Medicine Sleep Evaluation Center swallowed the pill prior to their regularly scheduled sleep studies so researchers could see how the pill’s measurements compared to a polysomnogram, the current gold standard. It was nearly as accurate, only off by about one breath per minute—more than capable of detecting respiratory depression. No one reported any side effects or discomfort, and post-study scans confirmed that all of the pills were safely passed within a few days.",technology
"In the mornings in Varanasi, the air on the banks of the Ganges fills with the scent of burning bodies. On the steps of the Manikarnika ghat—the holiest of the city’s stepped riverbanks, upon which Hindu dead are cremated—the fires are already lit, and mourners assemble by the hundred to accompany their loved ones at the end. Pyres of sandalwood (for the rich) and mango wood (for everyone else) are already burning; on one, a corpse wrapped in white is visible in the flames.

Down at the river, where I’m watching from a boat, some families are engaged in the ceremonial washing of their dead, the corpses shrouded in white linen and decorated with flowers. A few meters away, a man from another family (usually, the honor is bestowed on the eldest son) wades into the water, casting in the ashes of an already cremated relative so that the Ganges might carry their spirit onwards to the next life or even moksha, the end of the rebirth cycle, and transcendence.

The funeral ceremonies, held against the backdrop of the ancient city, are undeniably beautiful; but the same can’t be said of the river itself. The water’s surface is flaked with ashes; ceremonial flowers linger in the eddies. Just downstream, a couple of men are diving for discarded jewelry. Not 50 meters upstream, another group, having finished their rites, are bathing in the filthy water. An older man, clad in white, finishes his bathing with a traditional blessing: He cups the fetid Ganges water in one hand and takes a sip.

The Ganges is one of the most densely populated river basins in the world, providing water for an estimated 600 million people. But to Hindus, it is more than a waterway: It is Ma Ganga, the mother river, formed—according to the sacred text the Bhagavata Purana—when Lord Vishnu himself punctured a hole in the universe and divine water flooded into the world. Water from the Ganges is widely used in Hindu prayer and ceremony; you can buy plastic bottles of it from stalls all over the subcontinent—or order one on Amazon in the UK for as little as £3.

And yet despite its sacred status, the Ganges is one of the most contaminated major rivers on earth. The UN has called it “woefully polluted.” As India’s population has exploded—in April 2023, it overtook China to become the world’s most populous country—hundreds of millions of people have settled along the Ganges’ floodplain. India’s sanitation system has struggled to keep up. The Ganges itself has become a dumping ground for countless pollutants: toxic pesticides, industrial waste, plastic, and, more than anything, billions upon billions of liters of human effluent.

It’s March 2022, and I’ve come to India while reporting my book, Wasteland, about the global waste industry. And few issues in waste are more critical (yet less sexy) than sanitation. In the global north, sewage is a problem that many of us assumed was more or less fixed in Victorian times. But access to clean water and adequate sanitation remains an urgent global issue. Some 1.7 billion people worldwide still do not have access to modern sanitation facilities.",technology

Hi, everyone.

My name's Emily Mullin, and I cover biotech for WIRED.

It is my great pleasure to introduce

someone who really needs no introduction,

CRISPR pioneer, Jennifer Doudna.

She is a biochemist

at the University of California, Berkeley.

Dr. Doudna, of course, won the Nobel Prize in 2020

for her role in discovering the gene editing system

known as CRISPR.

She's also the founder of the Innovative Genomics Institute,

a joint effort between UC Berkeley, and UC San Francisco.

Please, let's welcome Dr. Doudna to the stage.

[bright music] [audience clapping]

Thank you so much for being here, Dr. Doudna.

It's been 11 years,

over 11 years since your landmark paper

appeared in the Journal of Science

first describing CRISPR as a novel genome editing system.

For all of us in the room, for all of our benefit,

can you remind everyone

what the acronym CRISPR stands for

and where CRISPR comes from?

Well, hi, Emily, it's a great pleasure to be here.

Hi, everybody.

So CRISPR is an acronym that stands

for Clustered Regularly Interspaced

Short Palindromic Repeats.

[audience laughing] Remember that?

I'm amazed I remember it.

But what it really is,

is a very powerful technology for editing genomes,

editing the code of life.

So imagine a tool that allows scientists

to literally go inside of a cell

and make a precise change to the DNA in the cell

that encodes all the information required for life.

And we can do this now with a precision

that allows us to program CRISPR

to target a particular gene,

I'm sure we'll get into what kinds of things are happening,

but it means that we can understand the function of genes

at a level that was never possible before.

And, most importantly,

we can actually manipulate those genes,

we can rewrite the code,

and that's what makes this technology so powerful.

Thinking back to the early days

of when you were studying CRISPR in the lab,

was there a moment either in the lab,

or maybe it was over your breakfast,

or driving home from work one day

when the potential of CRISPR

really dawned on you?

Well, you know, CRISPR came from fundamental curiosity

driven research into a bacterial immune system,

a mechanism that bacteria used to fight viral infection.

And it was by studying how that works,

that we figured out how to harness it

as a very different kind of technology

for manipulating DNA.

And, for me, I think it was really the moment

at which we recognized the mechanism

of this immune system,

and how it could be used to target DNA

in a programmable way,

and the understanding of how to program it

that, for me, was that moment

of kind of the aha moment of saying,

This technology is really going to change the world.

So for those of us who are not geneticists,

why edit genes at all?

You know, why not just give somebody

a small molecule drug, for instance?

Well, imagine that you had a way to manipulate genes

that cause disease or cause health.

It gives us a tool that means that in the future,

and the future is now by the way,

we won't have to take a drug

over a long period of time to treat disease,

but we can actually, for a genetic disease,

go to its source and make a corrective change

at the level of DNA.

So it fundamentally changes the way we think

about our health and the way

we think about the future of medicine.

And the hope is that these will be one-time treatments,

a one and done, correct? That's right.

So in mid-November, some of you might have heard

that the UK approved the first CRISPR-based therapy,

it's called Casgevy.

It is a one-time treatment

for people with sickle cell disease

made by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics.

What was it like for you, Dr. Doudna,

when you found out this news

that CRISPR had essentially moved from an idea,

a concept in the lab to reality,

to treating patients to something

that doctors can now prescribe

to people with this terrible disease?

The reality of that, for me,

came home when I met Victoria Gray,

who is the first US patient to receive the CRISPR therapy

for her sickle cell disease.

Extraordinary story of a person

who had lived with this genetic disorder,

had affected her whole life,

made it difficult for her to be a mom to her kids,

to pursue her business interests.

And after receiving this therapy,

a one-and-done treatment,

it completely transformed her life.

She didn't have to deal

with the effects of sickle cell disease anymore,

and she was able to enroll in business school,

and she's starting a clothing company, it's amazing.

So, you know, seeing that kind of effect on somebody's life

and realizing that science and technology

are starting to enable people

to truly transform their future is extraordinary.

Right, I've spoken with sickle cell experts,

doctors who treat patients with this terrible disorder,

and they say this is truly

a transformative therapy,

these patients who have these terrible,

excruciating pain episodes

and now they don't have to deal with that anymore.

Here in the US, the FDA is now poised

to decide on whether to approve this therapy

by the end of this week,

and perhaps today we might hear actually, we don't know,

could happen Friday at 4:00 PM, like the FDA often does.

Some people are saying that this is a cure.

How do you feel about the C-word?

Well, how do I feel about the C-word?

I feel very excited about it.

I think we have to be cautious,

because it's still the early days of CRISPR.

But so far it looks like people

that receive this one-and-done treatment

truly are cured of the effects of their disease.

What are the biggest safety concerns

with CRISPRing cells

that are put into a person's body,

like with this therapy,

or as we're talking about future therapies

that might actually have the CRISPR mechanism

right in the body where you're CRISPRing

people's tissues, organs,

injecting this gene editing treatment right into the body?

Well, I have to say I love your use

of the word CRISPR as a verb, Emily, that's great.

To CRISPR. [laughs]

But I think, you know, when we think about safety,

it's important to recognize that this tool

is being used today to make permanent changes to DNA,

but it's also possible to use it in a way that makes changes

that are reversible.

So I think going forward there will be a whole toolbox

of CRISPR tools that allow the kind of manipulation

to genes that is appropriate

given a particular disease or application.

But it is critical to maintain a focus on safety,

and, of course, that's what the whole

clinical trial process is all about.

Right, so with this therapy, and with others,

we hear about off-target effects.

Can you talk about what off-target effects mean?

And if we're talking about a precise genome editing tool

that's programmed to target

a very small place in a gene,

what could go wrong?

Well, we don't want it to target the wrong place

in the wrong gene.

And so the goal really is to ensure

that CRISPR is as accurate and safe as possible.

There's been a huge effort in the field over the last decade

to understand, you know,

when and how does CRISPR make a mistake?

And when it does, what can we do about it?

And also, most importantly, how do we avoid that?

And I think what's very interesting

is that looking at the clinical data

that are coming from these trials that are ongoing,

it's turning out that in clinically relevant cells,

using the type of validated CRISPR tools

that are being deployed in the clinic,

it appears really very safe.

It doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue

to work on this and pay very close attention to it,

but I think so far that issue has really not been a problem

in the application of CRISPR in humans.

The process of administering this sickle cell treatment

for patients is complex.

It's complicated, it's not as simple as taking a pill

or getting an injection.

It involves extracting patient's stem cells

from the bone marrow.

Then in the lab you have to CRISPR them,

to use it as a verb again.

And then, those cells are then returned

to the patient eventually.

But in order to do that,

the patient is in the hospital for many, many weeks.

They have to go through chemotherapy

to get their body ready to receive these cells.

There are all sorts of side effects

that they might have because of this process.

So it's not something that I think patients

are gonna go into lightly,

even though it does carry the promise of the C-word, a cure.

So I'm wondering, in the future,

do you think that this process could be simplified,

especially for patients who really, really want this,

but maybe the prospect of this complicated,

complex therapy, it's too much maybe for them

to think about and to undergo.

So how are scientists like yourself thinking

about simplifying this process

so that it's not so arduous,

I guess, for the patient to go through?

Well, it's not only arduous to go through,

but it also is expensive.

And that's one of the real challenges currently

is that this therapy is expected to be priced

somewhere between 1.3 and $2 million a patient.

So that's a price point that just,

you know, will make it out of reach for most people globally

that could benefit from it.

So I've been very interested in the expansion of CRISPR,

you know, into the world in a way that makes it affordable

and accessible to people that can benefit from it.

That was a very important reason we started

the Innovative Genomics Institute

at the University of California here in the Bay Area.

I think, you know, the Bay Area

has always signified innovation.

It's been a place that inspires creativity

with all of the people here, many of them here,

that are thinking about the future

and how do we create the future.

And so in terms of thinking

about the future of genome editing,

I really want to be working to ensure

that we make this technology

widely available and accessible.

And the question is, how do we do that?

And I feel that it's very important

to be working in the context of a nonprofit, which we are,

but also partnering as much as we can

with all kinds of companies, entrepreneurs,

investors, various stakeholders,

to build the technology of the future

that will enable, at some point in the future,

a sickle cell patient to receive a one-time injection,

maybe even that's a pill at some point that they take,

that is curative of their disease.

And today that sounds a little bit fantastical,

but I think it's very achievable.

And we have some concrete ways

that we're working towards that goal

at the Innovative Genomics Institute

to make sure that it becomes a reality.

Can you elaborate on that? I can.

So one of the big challenges right now

I think with CRISPR, and you alluded to it,

is how we deliver the CRISPR editors into cells,

how do we get them into a patient?

And today that's being done primarily by an approach

that for sickle cell disease, for example,

involves taking stem cells from a patient.

These are cells that are the progenitors

of our blood supplies, our blood cells,

editing them in the laboratory,

and then putting them back into a patient.

But we imagine a day when we don't have to do that,

that we actually have a tool

that will allow us to target the CRISPR molecules directly

to the cells that need editing in the body.

And we're doing this in a variety of ways

at the Innovative Genomics Institute,

but one of them involves taking the machinery

that viruses use to infect specific types of cells,

gutting that machinery

of all of the viral replication DNA,

so that you don't have a replicating virus,

but using the delivery vehicle

to deliver CRISPR molecules in a way that we can program

so we can program the vehicle

to go to the cells where editing is needed.

I think this is a very exciting future direction

of the field and something that will offer,

we hope, in the future patients the opportunity

to get a CRISPR therapy in a much more affordable fashion.

So let's bring it back to today.

And you mentioned the price of this sickle cell therapy,

the one that was just approved in the UK,

Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics,

they have not announced a price for this therapy yet,

but as you mentioned, Dr. Doudna,

there are estimates that this could be upwards

of two to $3 million.

There are a lot of patients with sickle cell

in the US, over 100,000,

although not all those, of course, will be eligible

or may want this therapy.

But for those that do,

as a society, how do we make sure that these people

are going to be able to get this treatment?

I think one important conversation that needs to happen

is that we need to be working with payers,

insurance companies,

to understand how do you think about paying

for a therapy like this?

As we've been discussing,

ideally it's a one-and-done treatment

that cures somebody of a disease

that would otherwise recur over the course of their life,

which is obviously, you know, very, very expensive

to think about all of the hospitalizations,

blood transfusions, other kinds of treatments they need,

plus the economic impact on their ability to work,

and to support their family, to contribute to societies,

it's a huge cost.

And so I think that's a very important conversation

that, you know, is starting,

and needs to happen I think more intensively now

that CRISPR therapies are a reality.

This is a disease that mainly affects people

of African descent.

And it's a disease that scientists

have been studying for a long time

and have known the biological mechanisms behind,

since what, the 1950s I think?

It's taken a long time to get to this point

where we have a potential genetic cure for these people.

What do you think it's going to mean

for the patient community

to have something like this that is so revolutionary,

that could change the lives of so many people?

One of the things I'm excited about is that this is,

as you said, this is a therapy that's helping people

that have been traditionally not treated very well

by the medical community,

and so I think that's very appropriate.

I think it's very inspiring.

I really salute patients

that have been willing to go into these early trials,

that requires extraordinary bravery and willingness,

you know, to try something that's truly experimental.

But I also think they're blazing a trail for many others,

because the hope is that this will be the first

of many opportunities to use CRISPR

not only for rare genetic diseases,

but also for conditions that affect many more people.

And there are already pretty advanced clinical trials

that are looking into ways

to affect diseases of the liver,

but also to think about preventive medicine in the future.

So if we really wanna, you know, be futuristic

about where genome editing is headed,

I think that in the longer term

we're going to see applications that allow us

to protect ourselves from diseases

that we might be susceptible to due to our genetics.

And, on that note, let's shift to CRISPR's uses

in other areas of medicine.

So a biotech company called Editas Medicine

was developing a CRISPR treatment

for a rare type of inherited blindness

that it ended up benefiting I think one patient,

she had really good results,

but then it failed in the other patients

in this clinical trial.

What do you think that tells us

about the limitations of CRISPR?

Well, I think it tells us that in that trial

they were working with patients

who had very advanced disease of the eye

where it may have been too late in a way

for a genome editing technology,

or at least the way it was administered to them,

to be effective.

So, honestly, I don't think we can conclude anything

about CRISPR itself from that example.

I think it's more of a statement about the way

we need to think about treating diseases.

When we're talking about a genetic therapy,

we need to think about it from the perspective of,

what time points in the disease pathway

will this kind of approach be effective?

You mentioned this a little bit earlier

about the question of how to deliver CRISPR.

So I was hoping you could elaborate on this a bit

about what are the barriers

to applying CRISPR to other diseases?

I'm thinking about neurological diseases

when you're thinking about putting CRISPR in the brain,

or organs that are not necessarily easy to get to.

How do we edit those parts of the body?

Well, it's a big challenge, Emily, that's for sure.

I think when we think about putting CRISPR into the brain,

we face the same challenges

that any kind of neurological therapy faces,

which is that it's very hard to get molecules

across what's called the blood-brain barrier.

So with CRISPR today, what's happening is that people

are using a physical approach to do that.

So you can do injections that cross the blood-brain barrier

and introduce CRISPR molecules

into particular parts of the brain.

And, in fact, I was at a meeting yesterday

where I was reviewing some data

from a scientist at Ohio State University.

He also has an appointment here at UCSF in the city

that allows targeting

of particular parts of the brain

with various kinds of molecules,

he wasn't using CRISPR, but, in theory, one could,

and seeing amazing effects on patients

that have really devastating neurological disorders.

So I think that, again, thinking about the future,

which is a theme of this meeting,

it's really exciting to think about the opportunities

to target genes that make people susceptible

to neurological disease,

Alzheimer's, neurodegenerative disease,

I think these are very important areas

of focus in the future with genome editing.

You're working on a new initiative

around using CRISPR to edit the microbiome.

What diseases might be treated that way

and why the microbiome?

Well, let's start with what is the microbiome?

The microbiome is the collection of microbes

that populate our bodies, our planet.

They affect really everything

about our health and our environment.

And what's really interesting with CRISPR is that,

as I mentioned earlier,

it's a technology that came from microbes.

And so what we're trying to do now

is to use CRISPR at its source,

going back into those microbes,

but not doing it traditionally the way scientists

have investigated one type of bacteria at a time,

but to really think about how we can edit whole populations

of microbes in their native environment.

And in terms of the impact there,

why would we want to do this?

There's increasing evidence that our own microbiome,

the microbiome that lives in the human gut,

affects a lot of the health and disease impacts

that we experience over the course of our lifetime.

And so we think that in the future it will be possible

to use CRISPR to fine tune that microbiome

so that it either doesn't produce disease-causing molecules

or does produce molecules that improve our health.

And in the environment, we have a project with folks

up at the University of California, Davis,

to impact the production of methane

by microbiome populations that live in cattle.

And you may know that methane

is one of the most powerful of the greenhouse gases.

So being able to reduce or even eliminate methane production

by cattle would actually have an enormous impact globally

on greenhouse gas production.

So we're actively working on this in the laboratory

to make sure that the technology is effective.

And then, of course, very importantly,

with our institute partnering

with farmers in other countries

to begin educating them about this technology

and, ultimately, to help them

begin to deploy it when it's ready.

So would this involve swallowing a liquid probiotic

with CRISPR molecules in it?

Or what exactly are you imagining?

Could be that, yeah, this is one of the things

we're researching right now,

is what is the best way to deliver,

again, this back to this question of delivery,

how do we deliver the genome editors into the microbiome?

And one of the approaches

that could be very interesting actually,

is using the viruses that infect bacteria to deliver CRISPR

back into a particular species of microbes,

so that's something we're exploring.

So, as you alluded to before,

there are several CRISPR therapies

being tested in clinical trials right now for HIV,

cancer, a hereditary form of high cholesterol.

What are you most excited

about when you look out at the CRISPR landscape?

Well, I'm certainly excited about expanding opportunities

to help people with rare disease.

I think that's very important.

It's an area that most traditional pharmaceutical companies

don't focus on, because it doesn't offer

the kind of economic payout that they might be looking for.

And yet, if we look collectively at people

affected by rare diseases, it's a large number.

And so the opportunity with CRISPR

is that because of its programmable nature,

once we understand how to use it for one disease,

we can, we hope, reprogram it fairly readily

to use the same molecules for a different disease.

And so I think that's one application that I'm very excited

about and is a focus of the Innovative Genomics Institute.

And then, of course, we already spoke

about the opportunities in climate change

with methane production.

And I think there are huge opportunities

in agriculture more broadly that, frankly,

many of us will experience, I think, CRISPR in our lives

in the agricultural world

before we might experience it clinically.

We could have a whole other conversation about that.

And I wanted to ask you to do a little bit

of a prediction for my last question.

And because you just mentioned

about people's lives being touched by CRISPR,

if you could look out into the audience

and give me a sense of, in 10, 20 years,

how many people out there will get a CRISPR treatment

in their lifetime?

Hmm, that's a hard question.

I think in 10 to 20 years, if you're talking

about somebody receiving an actual CRISPR therapy,

it's probably gonna be still a relatively small number.

I think that by a decade or more from now though,

most of us will be experiencing CRISPR in our lives

through the food that we eat,

through the environmental impacts that we're able to deploy

with CRISPR to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

I think that will be the more broad global impact

in the near term.

Well, thank you so much, Dr. Doudna, for joining us.

This has been a great conversation.

Thanks a lot, Emily. Thank you.",technology
"Currently, there are no big sales events on the go, and with Black Friday firmly in the rear-view mirror, it's full steam ahead to the holiday season. This means some deals coming out before Christmas aren't the lowest prices we've ever seen, but should hopefully still be heavily discounted.

For a gaming laptop that packs in one of Nvidia's RTX 4060 mobile gaming graphics cards, and has a 144Hz refresh rate screen that measures 16 inches - paying under $1,000 is a rarity these days, but at Best Buy you can get your hands on exactly that. The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 is only $949 at the moment and is an ideal choice for work or play.

We reviewed a variant of the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 laptop back in August and were impressed with how well the laptop performed in our suite of benchmark tests, how long the battery lasted, and how affordable it was before any discounts. This earned this gaming laptop a deserved Editor's Choice award for its feature set, price, and performance.

Lenovo Legion Slim 5 (RTX 4060): now $949 at Best Buy (was $1,349)

A slimline gaming laptop from Lenovo that packs an Nvidia RTX 4060 mobile GPU and pairs with a Ryzen 5 7640HS processor to power the 144Hz 16-inch screen. Other hardware specs include 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a small 512GB SSD.

The Lenovo Legion Slim 5 also comes with 16GB of fast DDR5 RAM which is needed for current gaming. 8GB just won't cut it anymore, and this means you don't have to splurge out on any RAM upgrade. Unfortunately the same can't be said for the SSD. Laptop manufacturers always put in small SSDs, with upgrades raising the price through the roof, so you might want to invest in a larger 2TB-plus SSD for this machine as modern games can easily eat up a meager 512GB.",technology
"I crouch unseen behind the bureau, the guard blocking the only exit from the room. Silently, I reach for a goblet, throwing it to the opposite side of the chamber. As the guard steps toward the disturbance, I emerge, sneaking behind him. With a flick of my wrist, my hidden blade emerges. He’ll never take another step again. Also, his halberd starts fritzing on the floor before fading out of existence, a reminder that this is all virtual reality—or rather, VR within VR, the metatextual framing of Ubisoft’s latest Assassin’s Creed game.

Ubisoft has had its fingers in VR for years now, from early efforts experimenting with the format—think Eagle Flight, an aerial racing game with a literal bird’s-eye view that evolved from a tech demo—to more fully featured games, such as the social deduction title Werewolves Within or co-op space adventure Star Trek: Bridge Crew, both from its Red Storm studio.

Assassin’s Creed Nexus VR is different. It’s bigger, more ambitious, leveraging the success of the publisher’s biggest IP. And while Red Storm once more leads development, Ubisoft committed no fewer than eight studios to its creation. This is a push, one intended to make the case that VR gaming has finally, truly arrived, that it’s at last a format worth bringing AAA properties to in meaningful ways, rather than for gimmicky spinoffs.

It’s a prosecution Ubisoft makes alarmingly well. Playing Assassin’s Creed Nexus on the Meta Quest 3 has that rare distinction of shattering expectations and feeling better than it should. If you’re a longtime VR player, it brilliantly combines the best elements of immersive gameplay into a cohesive whole, allowing you to move, climb, hide, and fight your way around stunningly realized locations. For Assassin’s Creed fans drawn to VR for the first time, it does an exceptional job of placing you in the role of an assassin, with all the stealth and parkour mechanics you expect from the core games translated almost flawlessly to a first-person experience.

That it’s a canon excursion through Assassin’s Creed’s increasingly vast lore doesn’t hurt, either. The story’s present-day framing places you in the role of a hacker, one infiltrating shady megacorp Abstergo’s latest attempt at manipulating the past to control the future. Better still? Gameplay that puts you into the genetic memories of three returning heroes—Assassin’s Creed II’s Ezio, AC III’s Connor, and Odyssey’s Kassandra.

For longtime fans of the series, it’s an absolute delight to revisit these stab-happy leads years after their debuts, and Nexus leans into their different play styles, further justifying the multi-character approach. Ezio boasts two of the series’ signature hidden blades, emphasizing his more shadowy nature, while Kassandra feels like more of a fighter, befitting her mercenary nature in Odyssey. Even Connor, considered one of the less popular of AC’s protagonists, gets a generous showcase, with his use of a tomahawk and a bow and arrow bringing a materially different feel to both combat and stealth.

Simply being in the assassins’ collective shoes provides a whole new appreciation for how tough their actions would be too. The climbing action borrows from the likes of, well, The Climb, VR’s signature climbing sim, requiring you to reach for and grab on to each hang point as you clamber buildings. Parkour demands rapid response times as you use the Quest Touch controller’s thumbstick to grab for swings, pulleys, and ledges on the move. It is a workout. Still, once you’ve reached a high point and taken a Leap of Faith, the series’ iconic free falls into conveniently ever present bales of hay—check your fear of heights at the door—or perform an air assassination on an unsuspecting guard beneath you, it’s all worth it.

If that all sounds a bit disorienting, it can be. Even players who have spent years in VR might find Nexus’ free movement occasionally dizzying. Thankfully, there are a host of comfort and locomotion options to mitigate this, allowing players to slow things down as they get used to embodying an assassin.",technology
"Transcript

Hi, I'm Jim Kurose,

I'm a professor

at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,

and I've been challenged to describe the internet

in five levels of increasing difficulty.

The internet is the most technically complex system

that humanity has ever built.

The internet is a network of networks.

It's a platform on which all of the internet applications

that you've heard of can be built.

[bright music]

Hi, it's really, really nice to meet you.

What's your name?

My name is Skylar.

Skylar, we're here to talk about the internet,

and I bet you must use the internet a lot, right?

Yeah.

What's your conception about what the internet is?

The internet?

For me, it's just something to use when I need

like to search up something or watch videos.

The internet is, physically, these computers

that all talk to each other.

Billions of computers, in the case of the internet.

The internet allows us to do

a lot of really, really interesting,

what we call applications.

You ever think about how that video gets to you

over the internet?

Yeah, I have no idea.

Got a favorite movie?

Matilda.

Matilda. All right.

We're gonna actually build an internet.

I've got a couple of things here that I wanna show you,

or a couple of toys, actually.

Okay, let's pretend that these round balls are computers.

And the internet is something that connects them.

And right now, the internet is just one communication link.

And Matilda is sent over the internet from this computer

to your computer.

So the internet is a network for carrying information

from one computer to another.

Now this network here looks pretty simple, doesn't it?

Right? It's just one thing.

Should we add some more friends in?

Yeah.

Let's say we want to get a video from here, over to here.

How do you think that video would sort of travel

through this network?

Maybe it could go to here, to here, to here, to here.

That's right.

So that's pretty cool.

There are actually lots of different ways to actually go

through the internet to get from what we call a source,

the place that's sending the information,

to the receiver, the place that's actually gathering

the information together.

And that's something we actually call routing.

Huh, but wouldn't it just be easier

for it to go from here to here,

instead of going from here to here,

to here to here?

Yeah. So that's a really good observation.

In most pieces of the internet,

that's exactly what would happen.

We want to take what's called a shortest path.

But still, there are multiple paths.

And why do you think that might be valuable?

Maybe one way is messed up or broken.

So you go the other way.

Exactly.

So, Skylar, that was a great discussion

about what we just built.

And I wanted to talk to you about,

or ask you about maybe one other really important

part about networks.

And it's not so much the thing itself,

the physical thing,

but more about the rules about communication.

That's governed by something that are called protocols.

Are you up for one?

Yeah. Knock, knock.

Who's there?

Lettuce. Lettuce who?

Lettuce go on.

[Skylar and Jim laughing]

A knock, knock joke is an example of a protocol, right?

The computer that you are using say, makes a request,

you ask for something, you get something in return.

In the internet, there are protocols everywhere.

So that two computers that have never talked

to each other before know the rules

for talking to each other.

This global internet with billions of people using it

are just lots of smaller networks

that are all hooked together to each other.

But also, what the internet allows

are all of these what we call applications, Zoom,

video playing services,

can all run on top of the same internet.

Yeah, so there's one internet for all of 'em.

Exactly.

There's one internet and lots and lots and lots of things

that you can do on top of it.

[bright music]

So you're a student in high school, is that right?

Yes, I'm a sophomore.

Well, we're gonna be talking about computers here today,

and we're gonna be talking about the internet.

I always like to think of the internet by analogy

to say road systems for example,

where you have roads in your neighborhood.

You have state roads,

you have the Interstate Highway System.

And so the internet is a lot like that.

It's an interconnection of local roads,

local networks like the network in your house for example.

How does like all of the networks in my house connect

to all the city networks?

Wow. Great question.

Often, it's a little blue wire called an ethernet cable.

So that cable is able to bring bits of information

up into your apartment at say, a billion bits per second.

That's pretty fast, right?

Literally a wire that goes between a box in your apartment,

sometimes called a router or a modem in your apartment

that comes from an internet service provider

come into this first network and then that network connects

to another network connects to another network

connects to another network.

You could FaceTime somebody who's like in Australia.

You can talk to them at the same time,

and like you're reaching the same signals.

So how is it that it gets there so fast?

We could talk about that by analogy to a road system.

It's not just one big, super highway.

It's a lot of smaller super highways

that are all interconnected.

And those interchanges are what are called routers.

That's where the links come together.

You're talking about talking to a friend in Australia.

So oh, it's coming in from the East Coast

of the United States to this router,

and it's going out say, that routers in San Francisco,

it's going out on an underseas cable over to Australia

rather than in this direction up to Japan.

So there is an underseas cable?

The underseas cables are so cool!

They're these big cables that are laid down by switches.

They cross both the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean.

So the undersea cables are how the networks in Europe,

United States, Asia are all connected together.

How do you connect wirelessly?

That's really what we call the first hop.

It's like from your phone, from your tablet,

from the computer that you're on,

there's no cables coming in.

You go over a wireless connection.

Wi-Fi is the protocol that allows your computer to talk

to that first hop router over a wireless communication link.

And I was wondering how there's so many different movies

or TV shows that you can download and they're all there.

And if you just play it, it just knows what to play.

Like they're all in one spot.

Ah, you said they're all in one spot.

In fact, they're in lots of spots in Netflix.

And so most applications would like to connect you

with a server that's close to you.

Server is really just a big computer with a lot of memory,

a lot of discs that store all the Netflix movies,

and also so that you don't have to cross over

too many internet links to get from where the server is

to the TV or the device in your home.

So when I'm watching Vampire Diaries in my house,

how does it know exactly what to do

without getting scrambled up?

Ah, another great question.

There's a couple of things that could happen

inside the internet.

Information is sent in these little packets of information

from the Netflix server to your display device.

And literally, each packet that arrives says,

This is the first packet for Jenna.

This is the second.

This is the third.

This is the fifth.

This is the fourth.

And they're reordered for you.

Matter of fact, your computer will say,

using the TCP protocol to the server,

Hey, I didn't get packet four, can you resend it again?

And again, the Netflix server is very happy

to send you packet four again.

The other is the internet protocol.

If you think about sending letters

through the US Postal Service,

how you've got an address on it.

So every packet that flows from the Netflix server to you

has an address on it.

It says, This is going to Jenna.

It's going to the what's called

the Internet Protocol address of your device.

Think of all the range of devices

that are hooked up to the internet.

It's totally amazing, right?

Every single one of them has one thing in common,

and that is they speak the IP protocol,

the Internet Protocol.

That was a great question.

[upbeat music]

So tell me a little bit about yourself?

I am a senior at New York University.

I study computer science.

Have you taken any courses on the internet

or studied it at all?

I've taken Applied Internet Technology.

So we've talked about backend/frontend frameworks

and libraries, things like that.

Okay, so really at the application level?

At the application level, for sure.

I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you know

about the history of the internet.

Have you heard of ARPANET, for example?

I have not heard of ARPANET.

Okay, back into the 1960s, there was a research agency

in the United States called DARPA,

the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Actually, it was called ARPA at the time.

They wanted to build this notion

of a packet-switching network.

Not a circuit switch network like a phone network

where you get a dedicated path

and a dedicated set of bandwidth and links

from source to destination.

So what would packet switching enable?

I'm sure there's something big here, for sure.

There's a lot big, right?

And so remember, this was a Department of Defense,

was they wanted to have forms of of communication

that were very robust, that were survivable.

Packets could all find their own ways,

be routed differently through the network.

So if parts of the network failed,

you could route around failures.

Sounds like the reason

for like a request response type of structure.

So you can sort of see how the network architecture

that wasn't designed to be 100% reliable

inside the core of the network,

and had that complexity built into the edges of the network.

And to me, the really cool thing is you

put this infrastructure in place,

and then all these super creative people

think about amazing things to build on top of it.

And you see this proliferation of amazing applications.

Abstraction, I think it's the reason why everything.

Ah ha! Spoken like a real computer scientist, right?

You're a computer scientist. I'm a computer scientist.

We talk about APIs, application programming interfaces.

The API for the internet is something

called a socket.

And a socket simply says,

I can communicate if I know your internet address,

you know, 128.119.40.186,

that number is the IP address of my server,

the University of Massachusetts.

If you know that, you can write a program

anywhere in the world and send a message,

and it'll pop out at my end.

I will be remembering that.

[Jim laughs]

I've heard that there are like seven keys to the internet,

something like that.

Okay, well I don't know about the number seven,

but there's something in the internet

that's sort of similar to that.

It's called the Domain Name System.

The DNS's role is to translate names

like gaia.cs.umass.edu, or ibm.com, or facebook.com

to an IP address so that your application

can actually send a message to that name,

to that named service.

This whatever quantity of people

is able to have some form of control?

So that's a great question.

Who do you think controls the internet?

I'm pretty sure the internet is fairly decentralized.

Okay. What does that mean?

No one authority holds control

over any sort of decisions or destinations.

That's 98% true.

And if you own a network, like you're att.com,

or your verizon.com, you can do, within that network,

you can do what you want, right?

So in that sense, the internet is very decentralized,

that the control of the network is up

to whoever owns the network.

The 2% where you said there's nobody in control,

there's a a little bit of centralized control.

There's an organization called

the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

Its responsibility is to handle, as the name ICANN suggests,

names and numbers.

It's that little bit of centralization,

central authority that you need.

When can we see the next tenfold increase

in in Wi-Fi speed?

In terms of tenfold speeds of increases,

depending on what device you're using right now,

it's available, all you need to do is upgrade.

So the Wi-Fi protocol's called 802.11.

And this is sometimes a source of confusion for people.

How can it be that I've got a connection

at 100 megabits per second from our TV into our router?

100 megabits per second not enough?

Packets dropping?

Where do they get dropped, do you think?

Somewhere in their travel process.

Exactly, right.

And maybe they're dropped in your apartment,

but much more likely, they're dropped because of congestion

somewhere between the Hulu or the Netflix

or the Disney server, if you're watching a video,

and your home.

So even though you've got 200 megabits per second

on that last hop, you don't have 200 megabits per second

from the server into your apartment.

I see.

I'm curious, has our conversation

sort of changed your view or sort of taught you new things

about the internet?

I think that I've sort of realized

that the internet is a technology that's dependent

upon so many other factors.

Some more in our control, some less.

[bright music]

Tell us a little bit about yourself?

I'm Caspar Lant.

I'm a PhD student at Columbia University

under Henning Schulzrinne's tutelage.

Oh, good pronunciation. [laughing]

Thank you.

I'm interested in networking, IoT,

and sort of what kind of data science you can use

with the datasets that you get from such devices.

One of the things that I designed before,

starting my PhD with Henning,

was a IoT pill dispenser, essentially,

which pairs with your smartphone,

which does facial detection

and other computer vision controls

and can basically tell who's taking

some sensitive medication

and make sure that they've taken it correctly.

We have these low-power devices

they're sort of at the edge.

Is it just connecting them in across a wireless link?

Is that the primary challenge or?

Well, I think the primary challenge is that for sure,

but then an additional challenge

is keeping everything configured in the way

that you expect it to be configured.

So for example, most IoT devices require you,

when you're configuring them for you

to enter some kind of captive login portal

where you connect to a local network

that the IoT device produces,

and then you can input your Wi-Fi SSID and password.

But then say if you were to change the password

or the name of your Wi-Fi network

or you move to a new place, then suddenly,

everything needs to be reconfigured.

'Cause that's a problem that scales linearly.

That you don't want the complexity of managing them

to go up linearly with that.

You'd like it to still stay pretty flat as you start adding.

Right, exactly.

I mean, the good thing about IoT devices

is that they tend to transmit

very, very small amounts of data.

We're used to ethernet cables

that can handle many hundreds of gigabits per second

over a wired device.

What are the typical data rates for IoT devices?

I mean, not hundreds of gigabits.

No, I mean I would imagine upper bound, KB per second,

lower bound, you could see bytes per second just on average.

But I mean, say that you have a temperature sensor running

off of your Arduino that's reporting the temperature

in your house every minute.

That's going to be far less

than kilobytes per second on average.

My sense is you're spot on,

that they'll produce over time, a lot of data.

And that a lot of IoT is about computing on that data.

That computation happened mostly at the edge,

or somehow a combination between the edge

and something happening in a far away data center.

Well, my sense is right now that all that data tends

to be centralized because IoT devices

are usually the commercial products of companies.

Do you think they'll share it?

Not without some persuasion,

but I agree that these data

have massive, massive research value.

Something I'm interested in with my research

is collaborating with people who manage

these distributed sensor devices,

and then taking advantage of those datasets

and comparing them to, say you were interested

in doing a research project on how daily rush hour traffic

impacts the acoustic landscape of New York City.

Figuring out, look, this street next to this school

is causing visible ratings above what we mandate.

And so there needs to be an intervention here.

I think for a long time,

the internet hasn't grappled with,

but now has with IoT and also with cellular networks,

generally is the question of mobility.

Do you imagine in the future that it might be possible

for mobile devices not to always have to connect

through the same provider to go from one network to another?

Definitely.

I mean, we're already seeing long range networks

like LoRa that can, first of all, provide access

over a much larger coverage area,

but then also look the same

because they're set up to the same specification,

regardless of where the individual gateway is.

[bright music]

So hey, Jen, it's great to see you again.

Good to see you, Jim.

We're in level five now.

So you're the expert-expert.

I'm a huge fan of the work that you did in RCP,

the Routing Control Platform being a precursor

to software-defined networking

and the notion that rather than having protocols

actually always compute things,

that we could compute things in data centers.

I'd be interested if you could sort of just reflect

back on that time and sort of the beginnings

of SDN and where it's come since then.

Yeah, and when we were at AT&T,

the thing we found most frustrating

is AT&T would buy routers,

and they would come pre-baked with a set of protocols

instead of knobs that you could turn if you wanted

to influence how the traffic flowed,

and a set of dials you could read to understand

what was going on inside the network.

Right, you couldn't directly do what you wanted to.

Exactly.

And so we started thinking about earlier work that was done

in the telephony network, the old telephone network.

And there, they had the same problem.

And they had the idea of having a computer running a program

tell a distributed set of telephony switches what to do.

But the idea was like, wow, it was kind of a revelation,

like what would that look like if we did that?

Not for the whole internet, but at least AT&T's part

of the internet.

So in other words, use software

instead of distributed protocols

to to tell the network what to do.

Yeah, do you see the softwarization of the internet

as a whole happening?

So, so far, it hasn't very much.

I mean, basically, software-defined networking exists,

let's say within a single provider backbone,

or a single cloud provider's network or a single campus.

There's been some work on doing it at the juncture points

between a pair of networks.

But one other trend that's happening

that makes it more possible is it used

to be that to get from one end to the internet to the other,

you have access networks getting much closer to, say Google

or Microsoft or other large cloud providers,

where even, you might only go through two networks

Right, so some people have called

that the flattening of the internet, right?

I think it used to be on average,

you would go through 10 different networks

to get from a source to a destination.

Right, exactly.

And if you take that even further,

they're starting to be more edge computing

where you might imagine you might have a cell tower

connected to a small number of routers,

connected directly to a server

that's gonna be running the application.

In that case, the entire infrastructure might be controlled

by a single party.

It's totally fascinating to me

that we have such an important global infrastructure,

and yet, the laws that that govern it tend

to be very, very local.

There are tens of thousands

of separately administered networks,

and of course, in hundreds of countries.

And the fact that it even holds together at all

is kind of a miracle.

Right, well it holds together because we have standards,

and we have protocols

that you mentioned. Exactly, protocol standards

for how the equipment talks to one another.

And increasingly, certificate authorities

that help bootstrap the secure, encrypted

and communication between end hosts.

So there are a few of these sort of centrally,

kind of agreed upon kinds of infrastructure,

but for the most part, each network runs itself.

And certainly, we've heard about some countries

that impose firewalls

that don't let certain kinds of traffic out,

or certain kinds of traffic in.

So there's no global body that is regulating that?

Not really because each country

really can have it's own laws and its own norms.

And so they can decide,

like the Great Firewall of China can decide,

they don't wanna let certain content be accessed

by the citizens inside that country.

So if a country decides they don't wanna answer a request

for a particular domain name, they say,

Hey, I don't want to let someone know the IP address

of this website.

They can decide not to let those answers be delivered

inside their country.

And so encryption plays a role in helping people

keep their privacy or prevent surveillance,

but it's not perfect.

It's often possible, still, to know a fair amount

about what people are doing, even if you can't look

inside the envelope at the letter that's written.

I mean, even you could just tell

that two people are communicating

even though the traffic itself is encrypted.

So you don't know what they're saying,

just even knowing two devices are communicating.

Exactly, and in fact, if you look at say,

the sizes of the transfers that they're doing,

you may know, hey, I'm talking to Netflix.

And by the way, this is the length of the movie I watched.

This is the size- So you can infer

or guess a lot of things.

Exactly.

You're one of the most awesome networking researchers

that I know.

I'm curious, just to pick your brain,

what do you think are some of the hot topics

in networking research?

Where do you think the field is heading?

Yeah, I'm excited about the convergence

of wireless communications, cellular networks, Wi-Fi

with networking and cloud computing.

And in particular, we're seeing in edge computing,

a convergence of all three.

Where you might have a mobile phone

or a drone or some other kind of device connecting

over the wireless medium directly to a network

that connects you directly to the server

that might run your application.

So you want the computation close

to where the endpoint is.

Exactly, and I think that what's now exciting about that

is all three of these technologies, wireless, networking

and cloud, which are normally three different communities,

three different sets of technologies,

three different sets of standards or practices,

now have to work together in close harmony

to be able to service applications that are really critical

and that that might be interacting with the physical world

in ways where safety is a potential concern.

You know, we've had cellular networks now

for 20, 30 years.

So when we hear about 5G,

what's trumpeted the most is the fact

that oh, super high bandwidth, right?

But I sense that the exciting things

are more than just the network being faster.

I agree.

It's both the high bandwidth, it's the low delay

so that you can have these applications

that interact with the physical world

and need answers in real-time.

It's about having the compute really close

so that you can integrate computation and communication.

It's about having more coverage.

Coming back again to the softwarization.

SDN and softwarization

is a maybe a little bit behind the covers,

that you wouldn't normally see it as a user going

from 3G to 4G to 5G.

You just see an increase in speed.

But yet, the way the network is now being managed again,

I think is bringing the cellular networking world

sort of into the internet world

in terms of the softwarization-

Completely agree.

I think the bringing in of compute and storage

is important too.

I think when you think just about networking,

it really is often just one part of the IT,

the information technology ecosystem.

Is there's often compute and storage as well.

And so, I think now there's an opportunity to have all

of those parts of the infrastructure work together

towards an even higher level goal.

And so I think it's a really exciting time

to be in the field 'cause now,

the plumbing is getting close to the application

in a way that it wasn't before.

So I really hope you've enjoyed this video,

and I hope you've also understood the internet

is part of the worldwide global communication fabric.

It's absolutely fascinating how it works.

I'm Lauren Ginsberg, professor of Ancient Rome,

and I'm here to answer your questions from the internet.

This is Ancient Rome Support.

[upbeat music]

@Abe_Eagle, why did Romans wear togas?

The average Roman did not go out of their house

hanging out in a toga because togas were extremely long,

extremely complicated gowns to put together.

So even extremely elite Roman citizens recognize the toga

as a ceremonial gown.

I like this image because we have all these people

who are wearing things that are decidedly not togas.

What they're wearing is the basic Roman garment

that any one of any status,

male or female would wear,

which is what's called the tunic or the tunica.

And this is essentially a long T-shirt.

@C450hs, did the Romans really wash their clothes in urine?

Yes, and essentially, so do we.

So if you look at any of your household cleaners,

you will see that one of the highest ingredients

generally is ammonia.

It's very caustic, so it's not always very good

for your things, but it cleans extremely effectively

and so the Romans were able to recognize

that urine when stored for quite some time,

tends to break down into ammonia.

So when you would bring your clothes to a fullonica,

so this is a laundromat essentially in the ancient world.

First thing was it would go into a vat

in which highly concentrated urine would be poured

and you would let it sit there.

Then the clothes would be washed with clean flowing water

in three to four separate vats,

until the end, it was basically perfectly clean

and it could be line dried.

FinnHuckster, did the Romans really have vomitorium?

Yes, but not in the way that you mean.

It is true that if you look at some urban plans in Rome,

stadium buildings, amphitheaters, theaters,

places where tens of thousands of people would come,

you'll often find the word vomitorium that's written there

and somehow a myth has been created

that this is where decadent Romans would go

after they ate too much food

and they would purge themselves.

This is not what those words mean.

It comes from the Latin word vomo,

vomere, which basically means to send forth

and so yes, on the one hand send forth your food,

but on the other, it can mean to send forth people.

So what these were were actually large, large stairways

to get lots of people out of a stadium very quickly.

So we actually still use the exact same technology

that Romans called vomitorium.

We just don't call them vomitorium

and I for one, think maybe we should.

@NotlandLEW, man, they didn't even have popcorn

back in Ancient Rome, true story.

What did they snack on in the Colosseum?

This made headlines last summer

because they've actually started to do excavations

in the drainage system of the Colosseum and in the sewers,

'cause if you think about it,

if you go to a rock concert today,

you can see everything sticky on the floor.

People throw their food all over the place.

Where does that go?

In Ancient Rome, it would go down into the drains

and it would go down into the sewers

and that means that things that can survive

for those millennia, we can be able to tell

that those were the kind of foods that were snacked on.

All sorts of varieties of nuts

and residues of nuts have been found in these sewers.

Fruits, for example, figs and peaches

and other fruits, grapes that were easy to carry.

Also, what they discovered was that people seemed to bring

or at least have access to small portable grills,

sort of like tailgating grills, little braziers

where they could grill meat at the time

as you watched people fight to the death and animals die.

@Juadog, why does concrete from ancient Rome stand up better

than modern concrete?

If we look at this dome in the pantheon of Rome,

it looks pretty spectacular today.

If we consider that this dome is made of concrete

and we think of a bridge

that might have been built into your city in the 1970s,

these two things do not look the same.

So just this past summer, a team of civil engineers from MIT

set out to figure out what this was,

and they think that they have an answer.

If you look at Roman concrete,

you can see in the matrix these chunks of white material.

So this group of MIT scientists figured out

that these white chunks called lime class were deliberate

and were also proof

that the Romans used something called quick lime,

as opposed to lime that had been premixed with water,

which had always been the assumption

and the quick lime superheats the chemical process

as it makes concrete

and so one of the things we've always known

about Roman concrete is that it can harden really quickly,

including underwater.

Also, the other property that they were able to recreate

in the lab was that Roman concrete can be self-healing

to a certain amount.

So if you put modern concrete

and roman concrete in a stress environment

so that the concrete cracks,

Roman concrete can actually heal that cracks

and the key that they think they found

is that these lime clasts, these calcifisised white chunks,

would be able to immediately distribute material

to those cracks and help with the self-healing properties.

It is much more expensive to make concrete this way,

so I'm not actually sure that we're about to have

a Roman concrete revolution,

but it is pretty cool that these scientists

think they've recreated what the secret

of Roman concrete is.

@Dylansfault, did those gladiators really fight lions?

How often did they die?

Absolutely, gladiators really fought lions.

It's not even like they would just be released

from a gate and everyone could tell.

An architectural investigation has shown the technology

through which lions below the surface of the floor

of the Colosseum would able to be launched into the air

to suddenly appear.

But the question about how often did they die,

we have tombstones that show gladiators who have won

50 different competitions in their life.

Evidence of gladiators who retire from being a gladiator

and train other gladiators

and so it wouldn't really make sense if every time

they went into the arena there was a 50/50 shot

that they weren't going to walk out.

Instead, what we see mostly when it's human versus human,

gladiator versus gladiator is a heavily stage managed,

choreographed fight that's designed

to be extremely exciting for the audience.

That doesn't mean that they weren't sometimes killed.

We do also have evidence that gladiators could be killed,

but that would've been agreed upon in advance

by whoever was running the games

and whoever had nominal control over the gladiator's life.

We have Getgators.

What did the Romans invent that we still use today?

One thing we wanna poke at is this word invention,

because the Romans sort of took things that existed,

concrete is a good example and perfected it.

But the example I think of immediately

is actually surgical tools, scalpels, tweezers, forceps.

But the actual basic tools, if you looked on say the set

of Grey's Anatomy or some medical show

would look extremely similar

to what the Romans were using in the past

and they would be made out of similar types of metal.

From ThisIsNiko, did they have bars in Ancient Rome

or did wine just flow freely down the streets?

Unfortunately, no, but they did have bars

and they had bars all over the place.

So these were often called taverna

and these would be bars where you could get drink,

but you could also get food

and this is a great example.

So this comes from some recent excavations in Pompeii,

in an area that were just open to the public.

And what you can see here is a big counter.

So you can imagine someone behind here

actually serving alcohol, but those big jars

that you see would also have food.

So stews, rich, hot items that people would either get

to have as their primary meal of the day in the bar,

or that they would then take home

where they could heat it up simply.

So these bars show up so often

in these working class neighborhoods of Pompeii

and the analogy I like to use is they show up as often

as a Dunkin Donuts does in the city of Boston.

And the graffiti that we found on them

shows that they're really a social hub of the neighborhood.

It's likely that you would just go to the pub on the corner

much the way we think of neighborhood bars today.

From Atepsflame, come on, I suppose next

you're gonna tell me that all those Greek

and Roman statues were actually gaudily painted?

Yes, I'm here to tell you that all of those Greek

and Roman statues were painted,

but I object to the term gaudily.

When people think about what it was like

to walk around the streets of Ancient Rome,

they think about these things that are here.

Bright white marble, marble buildings, marble statues.

The Romans would've found

all of this white marble extremely boring.

They loved vibrancy and they were also world-class painters.

There was a fantastic exhibit last summer

at the Metropolitan Museum of Art

that actually featured a number of recreated statues

in which scientists had very carefully taken tiny bits

of pigment on statues, so you could see that say a statue

of someone like Nero here,

each layer of clothing would be painted with shades,

with texture, with patterns

and the same thing is true with Roman buildings.

Rome was a wash of color.

Nevadaknight67, was Ancient Rome really

a sexual free for all?

So here's the thing, Romans had a very healthy sex life.

Romans had sex inside

and outside the institution of marriage.

Romans had sex for procreation, yes, but also for pleasure.

Romans had access to contraception.

Romans, especially Roman women,

would rise up when they thought that those rights

were being curtailed.

Romans have pictures and works of art

and literary texts that talk about sexual desire,

that talk about sex acts,

that talk about their favorite positions.

Short, it's women on top

is the thing that they seem to like a lot.

Men have sex with women, men have sex with men,

women have sex with women, women have sex with men,

and so much like today, it was really a spectrum

of sexual behavior, sexual performance,

sexual interest.

From thekinocorner, which Roman emperor

was objectively the best?

The Roman Empire was an autocracy,

which means that all Roman emperors were autocrats.

And it means, I don't actually think any of them

were very good people.

I think in general that form of government

doesn't lead to people doing good things.

So I'm gonna take a couple of examples

of good and bad emperors.

We have a friend Nero here

who everyone probably agrees,

the worst of the worst emperors.

And then we have everyone's favorite emperor

on the internet, Marcus Aurelius.

He wrote this nice book of stoic philosophy,

and so people think he's extremely chill

and thus under his empire,

things must have gone particularly well.

But let's ask this question objectively,

the best for whom and was he objectively the best

for the substantial population of the Roman Empire

at that time, who were enslaved?

We always have an idea of what we mean as best for whom

and I just don't happen to think that the Roman Empire

produced anyone that we would consider

to be a fair ruler today.

@RoyallyAri, how often do you think about the Roman Empire?

Well, this is a little bit of an unfair question

because I have to say the answer is more than daily

because it is a professional obligation.

I probably think about the Roman Empire

more than your average person.

@NzeoraHQ, how effective were public toilets

and bathrooms at keeping people clean

and how is hygiene in Ancient Rome?

Romans had extremely advanced technologies of water.

For example, they had extensive systems of aqueducts

that were able to bring clean water

across vast expanses of land.

They had a sewer system,

as of I believe the Fourth Century BC, that's bananas.

They had public bathing facilities.

So it was very regular if you were a Roman,

no matter your status, to actually go and use these baths

on a daily basis to clean yourselves.

And yes, they also had public toilets.

This would not be the only place

that people would go to the bathroom.

But you can see in this that we would have stalls.

They would probably not lead to a lot of privacy

and you can see that running along down the side of them

would be places for channels of water.

So what were the Romans not good at in terms of hygiene

with this water technology?

Well, they didn't understand things like dysentery,

about communicable diseases that way.

And so if you're having say, reusable toilet paper,

which in the Roman world would be a sea sponge

and it's being cleaned in vinegar,

which can do some things.

That's not gonna stop things like dysentery

from being passed along.

@NzeoraHQ, what kind of toys did Roman children play with?

We have so much wonderful information about the value

that was put on playing as a social emotional strategy

for raising Roman children.

One of my favorite is actually this doll.

This particular one is made out of ivory

and what's so impressive about it is you can see

that the limbs are articulated.

So you can see that you can sit this doll down,

you can have her stand up

and this doll actually also has the famous hairstyle

of the Roman empress at the time, Julia Domna.

So she's also a high fashion doll.

We know that dice games were very common.

Walking toys that would clearly teach little toddlers

how to walk and a lot of the building blocks

that teach children how to play with each other

were considered particularly important,

and with this doll could also be considered

extremely beloved objects that someone would keep

well past their girlhood.

From @El_Gringo_Loko,

what was the average lifespan of a Roman peasant?

This is a really great question

because you're gonna find on the internet

when you look this up,

this idea that the Roman average lifespan was 35 years

and then people often think as a result that if you made it

to 35, you were grandparent age

and that's just not true. 'cause we have to think about

what an average means.

Infant mortality in Rome was astronomically high.

Most children died within the first year of birth.

So that was just infant mortality.

Child mortality, about 50% of children died by age 10

and you can see already why that's lowering

and lowering that average.

So if you made it to age 10, as a lower class Roman citizen,

whether you were living in the country,

you had a decently high chance of making it

into your mid 50s and we know plenty of people

lived beyond that.

Our next question is from Krista Callen.

How does an archeologist look at an ancient column

and conclude this was a Roman brothel?

They could not do that.

We do know that there's a very famous purpose-built brothel

in Pompeii, and the building is entirely full

of tiny stalls and in each of the stalls

is only a bed shaped platform.

Above the stalls are extremely graphic sex acts

and then there is graffiti.

And my favorite that has survived is over one stall

and I have to imagine this was from the sex worker

that wrote, Thrust slowly.

Putting all of those things together, it's pretty easy

to see that this was a place where sex work

was on the agenda.

Numahonetweetu, what rights did Roman women gain

in Imperial Rome?

Roman women couldn't vote, and that's a big one.

But Roman women could be citizens.

Roman women could own property in their own name.

They could inherit property in their own name.

Roman women could be business owners

and some of whom were using their own business sense

to advance their children, especially their sons

in their political ambition.

Roman women could hire a lawyer to defend themselves

or to bring a suit in court.

Roman women lived with a greater degree of freedom

across social classes than we're used to seeing

in the ancient world.

@EngCreamCakes, how many civil wars did Rome have,

including the Byzantine era?

That is a very hard question to answer

for very good reasons.

One is that the Romans thought that civil war

was something inside them

that you had to fight against every day or it would erupt.

Romans had documented civil wars,

and they're the ones that actually came up with this term

where two Roman armies would fight each other,

headed by two Romans.

But what's the difference between that

and an uprising of enslaved people who are part of

the Roman population like Spartacus?

Is that a civil war?

What's the difference between the whole system

of Roman provinces rising up against Roman rule?

They're part of Rome and they're rising up

and they're fighting, but they're fighting

more with guerilla War tactics.

Do we call that a civil war?

You can see it becomes very hard to parse

when one part of Rome is fighting the other.

But it happens all the time.

@BloodOorange, what the fuck did Ancient Romans wear

during the winter?

I know, right, 'cause all the images we see

are in these sort of lightweight linen shirts

and like sandals.

That's our image of Rome and it snowed in Rome.

Well, the key to Roman happiness,

and this would be layers in the same way that it is today

and Romans actually had access, even then, to material

that we know is the best to keep you warm

and that is wool.

So the average Roman would wear socks.

Yes, Romans really pioneered the idea of socks and sandals.

They would wear extra thick socks,

but they also didn't just wear sandals.

They had thick leather shoes

and the more layers of leather,

the better those shoes would be in winter conditions.

And then cloaks, tons and tons of beautiful wool cloaks

on top.

@RobertSmith29th, I was wondering

how the Romans produced their Roman coins

and how they put the emperor onto the coins.

The way the Romans made coins was a by hand process.

So what you would do is you would have a base

and you would put in this base a mold

that had one side of the coin.

And in that mold you would put a metal disc

and I would put it face down.

So you can imagine it's almost like a clam with two molds

and the metal disc goes in here,

then I take a hammer and I whack it.

And that's called stamping.

And that would put the images on both sides of the coin.

From @theistinthought, did Ancient Romans go on hikes

or go to the beach for relaxation?

Yes, there was a heavy leisure time activity in Rome

where people would go to the coast,

especially the Bay of Naples, and have seaside villas

and go to these really fancy baths,

sort of like a spa vacation,

but it could last months.

The extreme elite of Rome

that would have access to these seaside villas.

So the average Roman person probably didn't have a lot

of time to be able to do that.

So what did they do to relax?

Rome had a lot of holidays around a festival calendar

and these festivals would feature gladiatorial matches.

They would feature chariot racing.

They would feature theatrical spectacles,

including the ancient equivalent of musicals.

And we have evidence that people,

even from rural communities, would come in

for these festivals, especially the big ones.

That's because they were state holidays.

In the empire, there were over 100 days of public holidays.

@jus_Tamon, so like in Ancient Rome,

what was living there like?

People worked and then went home and did they pay rent?

The average Marcus, I should say instead of the average Joe,

he could be a shoemaker,

could be someone who sews clothing, could be a launderer.

Any of the activities that you need done

in your general city life would be the same thing

that they would need done in Ancient Rome.

Sometimes home was right above you.

If they were quite wealthy, they might own the space

that their shop is in.

But often they would be renting out both of those spaces

from a landlord

and you bet the Romans complained about their landlords.

Shoddy upgrades, vermin that weren't being taken care of.

A neighbor who parties too hard

and wakes the baby.

@Tweekfan25, did they have weed in ancient Rome?

Yes, but not in the way that you were asking.

Romans really loved hemp as a plant

and they loved how easy it was to make ropes with it.

We find hemp products all over the place

and hemp, the word for it in Latin is cannabis.

So you can see the connection,

but there's no sense that the Romans, first of all,

smoked it.

Smoking was not a particularly good thing in Roman culture.

But there's also not great evidence

that they recognized

its sort of mind altering possibilities.

@Kevin_Feeney, it will always be faintly extraordinary to me

that Roman historians cannot agree on the answer

to the superficially simple question

of how many Roman emperors were there.

So when Augustus is the first emperor,

he declares a successor, Tiberius.

Tiberius becomes the next emperor

and miraculously we have two.

So why is it so hard to keep counting?

Eventually Rome becomes big

and eventually other people decide they could be emperor

and what does it take to become emperor?

For a lot of Romans, the answer is an army

that they're paying can declare them emperor

and they can besiege Rome until they are declared emperor.

Flash forward to later in the Roman Empire

when we have divided centers.

Is the center of Rome the city of Rome anymore, no.

There is a center in Constantinople.

Sometimes it's Milan, sometimes it's Ravenna.

We're getting them multiple emperors

or people who could be perceived as emperors

at the same time.

But we also get usurpers.

Guys with armies that come in, think, I could do this.

And who gets to declare the emperor at that point?

There aren't rules for this one way or another.

It can become really hard for us to tell who is emperor

and sometimes all we have is a single coin as evidence.

Just one coin that one guy who claims to be emperor minted.

Was he emperor, we have no idea.

@TerraEncounters, how many Gods did Ancient Romans worship?

It's not really fair to ask how many gods they worshiped.

It's more fair to ask what Gods didn't they worship.

Romans saw divine in lots of things.

Springs had a divine being.

Caves had a divine being.

They had a festival to ward off mildew

and it was called the Robigalia and it was in April

and that showed that they also thought that mildew

had a divine spirit in it,

that they could essentially bribe

to not destroy their crops.

So the Romans had a really heavy investment

in seeing the divine in as many places as possible

and finding a way to connect with that religiously.

@ShakeShur, I need someone to tell me if Romulus

and Remus were real, like immediately.

Romulus and Remus are the legendary founders of Rome.

They were twins who had been expelled from their patrimony

by an evil king, and they were supposed to be drowned

in a river and the legend goes that a she wolf found them

and nursed them and prevented them from dying.

And then when they grew up, they were able to overthrow

the evil king and they were able to found

their own civilization.

But even the Romans are pretty skeptical about this story.

You can see a lot of the historians later saying,

really, a she wolf, are we sure it wasn't a sex worker

that we just called a she wolf?

This was a pretty legendary story,

sort of like George Washington and the cherry tree,

and they didn't put much factual faith behind it.

All right, that's all the time we have

for questions for today.

I hope you learn something weird

and interesting about Romans and we'll see you next time.",technology
"Many of Ukraine’s new volunteers were “terminally online”—ordinary digital natives forced into a brutal conflict. Gen-Z recruits did dance videos for TikTok. Their meme game was wild. Woodruff’s Twitter bio reads “British Chef Fella”—a reference to the North Atlantic Fellas Organization, or NAFO—an online movement of Ukraine-supporting shitposters with shiba inu avatars who flood social media with memes mocking the “Vatniks” (Russian propagandists).

The NAFO movement taunted Russia, at one stage managing to send the country’s ambassador in Vienna into a public meltdown. “Imagine, literally getting a world-class ambassador to speak with cartoon dogs on Twitter,” says Ivana Stradner, an adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington DC, an expert on misinformation and propaganda, and NAFO member. “This is the future of information warfare.”

NAFO does what state-backed information warriors, particularly those from democracies, can’t do. Its members make insane, often tasteless jokes, moving quickly to jump on trends. They’re good at memes, and flood the zone with infectious pro-Ukrainian vibes, humanizing, entertaining, and explaining to people far from the war why they should care. “I think NAFO, by boosting certain narratives, can actually also help people understand the severity of the situation and what's going on there,” Stradner says.

NAFO has helped raise millions of dollars through sales of merchandise (“I invaded Belgorod and all I got was this lousy T-shirt”) and crowdfunding campaigns. Now its avatars appear on the Twitter profiles of European politicians, on official Ukrainian defense channels, and on military equipment headed to the front. It has funded everything from food to medical supplies to a mobile artillery piece to the Georgian Legion, a unit of overseas volunteers that has been fighting since 2014. When the Frontline Kitchen’s vegetable shredder broke, Woodruff put out a call for funds to buy a new one. In the time it took him to drive to the supplier, the money had already been deposited in his account.

Social media works in tandem with the tight networks of Ukrainian society. This is a war being fought close to home—everyone knows someone at the front, and the soldiers are in constant contact. Link people like Vorobiov can connect those in the trenches with supporters in Kyiv or overseas. A unit under fire can ask for drones on Telegram, and within hours there’s a call for donations out on Twitter or Instagram. Vorobiov can deliver tourniquets to a combat medic near the front, and record a thank-you video to send directly to donors.

“I see a spike in donations when there is a story that I can tell of how donations help,” Vorobiov says. “Yesterday, I received a very long message from one of the medics, and she was telling me how medical supplies we brought to her helped her basically provide care to two servicemen. I posted that story on Twitter and folks started to donate.”

Sometimes, donors become more active participants. Last February, Polish filmmaker Maciej Zabojszcz was watching the conflict unfold over Twitter, and thinking about selling some of his military memorabilia to help raise money for a 4x4 for the Ukrainian army. But then, a graphic video emerged, apparently shot by Russian soldiers, of a Ukrainian prisoner of war being horrifically mutilated. “I felt like something changed,” he says. “I said, listen, let's not only buy one car.”",technology

My name's Alan Henry,

I'm a special projects editor here at Wired.

This is all about the next 30 years.

And what a great trailer that was, right?

This is the first time it was seen anywhere

except in a very few select offices.

I'd like to bring everybody up on stage.

Let's see, let's start with,

well, we had a VOG or something for them,

I don't know, anyway,

let's go with Bjarke Engels, come on down,

the founder of Bjarke Engels Group.

[Audience applauds]

Yeah, give it up guys, come on.

And then, Catherine Murdoch,

executive producer of this show that you just saw

of the Brief History of the Future,

and co-founder of Futurific.

As well as Ari Wallach, [Audience applauds]

who's the host of our show,

and also co-founder of Futurific.

So yeah, let's,

oh, I should probably sit down,

'cause you guys are comfortable. [chuckles]

So first of all, tell me a little bit

about how the show came together, right?

It's so interesting, because, you know, I work in media,

a lot of people here work in media,

we know that a lot of the most popular stories are the ones

that reveal to people

exactly how awful things are right now, you know?

A wildfire just destroyed a town, or something like that.

And you guys said, you know what,

we wanna do something different,

we wanna showcase the human ingenuity

that is confronting our existential challenges.

How did you guys come up with that idea?

How did you sell it?

Yeah, well, thank you so much for having us.

I mean, I've been working in climate change

for over 15 years, and democracy reform for over six,

and so I'm really very familiar

with the narratives of what could go wrong.

And it's understandable, it's very high consequence terrain

that we're playing in right now,

there are a lot of things that can go wrong,

and it's worth thinking about those worst case scenarios

so that we can make sure they don't happen.

But what I noticed was that there was really nothing

about what happens if things go right,

and there's only so much fear and anger that you can push

before people start to turn off.

We need to have, not just a Pollyanna hope,

but really a path forward to a better future.

And all the things that we're working on, you know,

through philanthropy, and through many of the people I know,

including Bjarke,

there are people out there that are making better futures,

but they're just not highlighted in the media

or in popular culture.

And so, we really wanted to just go out there

and say, this is worth doing.

So Bjarke, one of the people

that they went out to talk to was you,

and you know, I don't think we got to see it in the trailer,

but I got a little sneak peek

of some of the episodes coming next year on PBS.

And some of that

is some of the incredible work that you're doing

to transform the way that we build structures

and think about communities, to make them more,

not just environmentally friendly, but more people friendly.

Can you tell me a little bit

about what goes into that design process of like,

making a different kind of future

than the steel and concrete future that we have today?

Yeah, I mean, I think,

actually, the first project we ever did,

like more than 20 years ago,

was the Copenhagen Harbor Bath,

and that's because the water in the Port of Copenhagen

had become so clean that you could swim in it.

And then on opening day, you see suddenly

all these Copenhageners jumping in the port, and you realize

that a clean port is not only nice for the fish,

it's actually amazing for the people that live there,

because they don't have to, you know,

like drive for hours to get to the beaches,

they can jump in the port in the middle of the city.

And we thought, maybe this is part of a bigger idea,

and we called it hedonistic sustainability,

the idea that the sustainable city,

or the sustainable building,

not only is better for the environment,

but it's also much more enjoyable to live in and to work in.

And that's essentially

what we've been trying to do ever since,

is to try to find examples

where the extra effort that goes

into making a building sort of higher performing

vis-a-vis the environment, or more sustainable,

also makes it more enjoyable and more desirable.

And I think that's the only way

that the sustainable future will win,

if it's actually more exciting and more alluring

than the opposite.

Yeah.

I mean, I live at Harlem, and I can only imagine,

like, I remember when I saw that, and I said,

what an amazing thing that would be, to be able to just,

I mean, this sounds terrible, but,

what an amazing thing it would be

to be able to just jump in the East River,

just go for a swim.

Now, I don't recommend anyone jump in the East River.

If you're in New York City, please don't.

But like, imagine-

But actually, you'd be surprised,

just to contradict you,

is that we're actually working on a project

called the River Ring

at the end of Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg,

right next to Domino Park,

where we're actually creating this kind of loop

with a kayak launch and a beach and a tidal pool.

So- There's a tidal pool.

Even though it sounds like science fiction,

eventually it will be reality, even in the East River.

Oh my God, I'm gonna go swimming the East River.

So in five years please do jump in the East River.

[laughs] I very well may go swimming in the East River.

Ari, talk to me about hosting the show.

Like, you get to meet all of these incredible people,

these brilliant minds

who are trying to make a better world for all of us,

like, it must be inspiring.

I mean, just before we walked on stage,

just listening to that trailer again,

I'm like, oh, well, first of all,

hats off to all of you for making such an empowering trailer

because I mean, you know,

it's hard being on stage up here, guys,

I mean, I'm nervous,

I hear that, and I'm just like, ooh, I'm ready to go.

Like, what's it like working with these people?

Well, first of all, let's go back a little bit

to actually the founding of Wired, right?

We're 30 years into it.

It is our 30th birthday, you know.

30th birthday, so I look,

I went to UC Berkeley, I grew up on Wired,

I was here in the '90s,

and kind of cut my teeth as a budding futurist

going to talks at Global Business Network

across the bay at Emeryville

with Stewart Brand and Peter Schwartz and Kevin Kelly,

and a lot of the folks

who were kind of thinking about what tomorrow could be.

And what I realized over the past 20-plus years

of kind of doing this futuring work around the world

for the UN, White House and other folks,

was more and more I was being asked, not to imagine what if,

what if it went right, like Catherine was saying,

but it was more around risk mitigation,

how do we make sure we are in the right position

if something goes wrong?

And that started off small in the 2010s, and only increased.

And so when I met up with Catherine

and we started talking about the show,

we realized two things.

One, we're missing these visions and these stories

of the tomorrows that we want,

not just the ones that we want to avoid.

And two, we're missing them

because like you said in the intro, more often than not,

we're not just telling those stories,

if it bleeds, it leads.

And so for me it was, yes, I've been doing this work,

I'm kind of an eternal optimist

and very hopeful as a futurist,

but to be honest,

I was starting to lose a little bit of that faith.

And so what this journey did for me personally,

and then hopefully we share it with all the viewers,

is, no, no, no, no, no,

there are lots of folks out in the world

thinking about better tomorrows.

And in many ways,

and this goes back to kind of the founding of Wired,

and what I was doing here in the Bay Area 30-plus years ago,

is, it's in technology, but it's not just in technology.

So one of the things that you'll see in the show

is we don't have episodes like the Future of Food,

or the Future of Housing,

in many ways what the show centers on

is these almost eternal questions of,

what do we want the future of food to be?

What do we want the future of housing to be?

This is what it was like

when I was at GBN in the '90s, right?

Going to these talks.

And so, meeting these folks around the world,

be it in Japan, or India or Morocco,

who are saying, no, no, no, this is what we want clean,

sustainable energy to look like,

here's how we want to share it,

here's what it looks like in a global grid,

like Buckminster Fuller first thought of decades ago,

was empowering, right?

It brings back both for the work that I do,

and also hopefully for the viewers,

a sense of agency and hope for the future,

especially right now

when so many of the stories that we hear and see

and read about the future is one of doom.

Yeah.

That's a really interesting thing, 'cause I want to segue

into this concept of the protopia, right?

With something that came up

in the course of producing the show.

We all know about utopias, we all know about dystopias,

but talk to me about what a protopia is.

Like, I mean,

I imagine a lot of people here get it from context, right?

But I would love to hear what you guys describe,

what that means to you.

So let's bring it back to Wired.

Why not? We're on your stage.

You don't almost think we planned this.

So you know, Kevin Kelly in 2011

kind of put forth this idea of protopia,

and it was this idea of better tomorrows,

not perfect, but better, better than they are today.

And you know, there's a very long kind of philosophical way

of talking about it,

but I'll let Catherine give an an amazing kind of shorthand

that we use in the show for it.

But this is what we wanted folks to see and feel and hear,

at the end of the day,

a lot of the work that we do in futuring

is about possibilities.

And the way you really kind of anchor that conversation is,

if you can't see it, you can't be it.

I know that sounds cliche,

but more often than not, we're not showing people

what we could do in the positive.

And don't get me wrong, I love sci-fi, grew up on it,

but most of the sci-fi that we watch

are images and stories of worlds we do not want.

And so, worlds that we do want are protopias.

I'll let Catherine kind of give you her version of,

in the shorthand. [Alan chuckles]

The shorthand is, a protopia is somewhere

that you would want to actually live,

either you or someone you love,

it could be your children or other loved ones,

but you could envision you or those people in that world.

And, you know, again,

one of the reasons that we got involved in this

was that my daughter came to me

and said she didn't think there was any hope for the future.

I said, What are you talking about?,

you know, I've been doing all of these solutions,

you know about everything that we're working on,

there's so much progress.

And she said, Look at the books,

look at the films, look at the television,

everything about the future is dystopian, it's hopeless.

And that is really what got me thinking

about both what we're telling our young people,

and also, that we needed to change this narrative,

because I knew for a fact that that's not the case.

So we have to start highlighting those things

so that people can visualize a better future

that we can get to.

I would love to hear from you a little bit about like,

you were saying, you've worked on these solutions before,

you've seen proof, and talked to people

who are making actionable, measurable change.

Like, how did that prepare you for this project?

Like, I imagine,

I mean, ideas running through your head all the time,

but like, what stood out to you?

I mean, there's so much,

in a way, we still have too much,

we could do another season very easily.

[Alan chuckles]

And we will be. [Catherine chuckles]

Beautiful, I like that, I love it.

And that's what's so exciting about it though,

you know, I definitely drew on my background

on the climate stuff, on environment,

on circular economy, on democracy,

you know, citizens assemblies and things like that,

there's so much out there that people,

maybe they've heard a little bit about it,

but they don't really know it in depth.

But there's more,

and we learned a lot in the process as well,

and that's really what we wanted,

we wanted to share that with people,

and we wanted to just give that hope.

There's also other elements in there

that aren't just people, you know,

sort of doing philanthropy,

it's actually,

you know, one of the people that we approached for this

who's in it, is Kylian and Mbappe, and you think,

well, why would a soccer star be in a show about the future?

And it's actually really simple,

because when you're an athlete, you visualize success,

you don't have a coach sitting there saying,

you're gonna fail, you're gonna fail,

you're never gonna make it to the World Cup,

you're never gonna go to the Olympics,

that's not what they do, they help you visualize the goal,

and then you plot out a way to get there.

But as a society, we're not doing that,

we are only talking about failure,

and so to us, like, this was when,

and you know, he's so excited about this whole project.

he wants to be part of, not just the show,

but everything else we're doing

with Futurific the studio as well,

so people are really hungry for this type of thing.

That's fantastic.

Bjarke, tell me a little bit more about,

speaking of some of those projects

that exist already, right,

things that people have been working on already,

like some of the other things that you've been working on,

tell me a little bit more

about some of those exciting things,

'cause I think people need to hear

some of that good news, you know?

No, for sure.

Actually, it's funny, we've always been working

with the idea of pragmatic utopia,

which is essentially,

you could definitely compress it into protopia,

because I think, ultimately,

when you are designing something,

you are trying to sort of imagine and realize

the world that you would like to find yourself living in

in the future.

And I think very often,

our role is to try to look and listen

how the world is already evolving,

how certain technologies have already become available.

And I think an example you saw in the trailer

was CopenHill, the waste-to-energy power plant

that we opened in 2019.

And essentially,

it turns the waste of the city of Copenhagen

into district heating and electricity, and it's so clean

that the steam coming out of the chimney is actually cleaner

than the air of Copenhagen, it's beautiful.

So we could turn the facade

into the tallest manmade climbing wall on earth,

it's 300 feet tall,

and we could turn the roof into an alpine ski slope,

which of course, again, sounds like.

Skiing on garbage.

No, exactly. It's like white trash, you know?

But it also sort of makes it so blatantly obvious

that clean technology is not only better

for the environment,

but it creates, in this case, a destination,

and I think one of the main landmarks of Copenhagen today

is a waste-to-energy power plant,

and you can actually alpine ski on its roof.

And what I love about it is, my son is five,

so he doesn't know that there was a time

when you couldn't ski on the roof of the power plant.

Oh, that's wonderful.

So imagine, his whole generation,

their baseline has just been lifted, so if they have to come

with like wild ideas for their future,

that's where they start.

That's where they start, right,

it's gotta be even wilder than that.

So I think in that sense that,

since technology and society is evolutionary,

that each new tool or technology enables

the discovery of even more new tools and technologies,

that there is this kind of almost like,

Kurtzweilian sort of acceleration in innovation

that actually gives us a lot of reasons

to be hopeful and optimistic,

because we are constantly getting cooler tools to play with.

That's fantastic,

and I wanna come back around a little bit

to this concept of empathetic technology,

or empathetic use of technology, right?

There is an episode that has to do with AI,

and you guys are gonna hear a lot about AI today,

I hope you're ready,

but also, like there's a human element here, right?

How can we make these technologies

in a way that services all of us, it lifts all of us,

it provides for all of us?

And like, I'd love to hear a little bit about your thoughts

about using technology in an empathetic, human-centric way,

like how do we drive towards that?

And I don't wanna necessarily say

away from like kind of the current model

of monetization and everything,

but I think there's room for both, right?

We can make technologies that are sustainable enough

to continue themselves, but also support people.

Yeah, and I think that's one of the things

we really wanted to focus on in the show is,

it's not just a show about new technology.

Technology doesn't exist in a vacuum,

you have to have the social systems

that support all of that.

Everything has to function, we have to have conversations

and be able to hear each other,

we have to understand and trust in government regulations

and things like that, and we're not there right now.

So that's part of why we talk about democracy,

none of these things are silos,

they all interrelate together,

and having that conversation is really, really important.

I mean, again, not to give away the show,

and not to inundate you with AI,

but part of it is like, what goes in is what comes out.

So part of what we talk about on this show is,

something that you'll hear a lot about today,

is kind of like training data, right?

And right now, the data that we are training our LLMs on

and whatnot, isn't necessarily the best data.

And so part of what we do,

because of where it's scraping from,

part of what we do in the show, in many ways,

is think about, and ask the question about,

how do we want to train and raise

the next super intelligence on this planet.

And as a parent, I can tell you,

there's a couple of different ways you can parent, right?

And if you want, you can stick your kid

in front of subreddits all day and say,

this is how you should behave when you grow up.

Oh, no. [chuckles]

Or, and we visit a lot of folks,

so there isn't just an AI episode,

but it kind of is a strain that runs throughout,

is how do we find the best places of where we're being human

and connecting as humans, and being humane,

give the visions of what that looks like,

and then have that actually be the training data

for the AIs now and to come.

I'm not giving anything away, that's how we look at it,

that's how come the folks that we choose in this show,

the conversations we have, how we have conversations.

In many ways, look, we recognize,

A Brief History of the Future Season 1

is itself training data.

So how we did the interviews, where we went, who we chose,

who we included, who we brought to the table,

was both important for us, the stories that we were telling,

but for the eventual training data that the show itself is.

Right.

Yeah, 'cause I mean, after all,

the show is eventually going to be part of training data

for something else, and then another project,

and things like that.

Ari, I wanna ask you,

before I kind of get to my last broad question,

I wanna ask you about what it means to, to you,

being a futurist, right?

Because the title being, like a futurist,

can mean so many different things

depending on who has that title.

And also, you know, when I followed you at Instagram,

I noticed one of the things that you say in your profiles,

that you're aspiring to be a great ancestor,

and that really hit me, right?

I mean, what does that mean to you?

What does it mean to like, leave those keys behind

and aspire to a better future?

Look, there's a couple of ways of futuring, right?

I won't bore you

with the long history of futuring in America,

but it actually came out of the US Air Force

and the Rand Institute.

And again, it's what I said earlier,

it's around risk mitigation, really was,

how do we beat the Russians?

It was a zero-sum binary game.

And even scenario planning, which is multiple futures,

was kind of set up in that way.

And so, there's a kind of next generation,

not that there's anything wrong

with the previous generation of futurists,

a next generation of us, who are coming along and saying,

our job isn't to predict,

our job is to give different examples of what futures

could be based on the decisions that we make today.

So in many ways, futuring today is as much about ethics

as it is as keeping up with the latest technology, right?

And being able to ask those questions.

So to me, when I come into a room, be it a room like this,

or in a board room, or a situation room, or a living room,

it's really saying, what is it

that we want to see manifest, and how do we get there,

but not being pollyannish about it?

So using mega trends, and quantitative futuring methods,

and means to help folks make those decisions.

In this show, we talk a little bit

about decolonizing futures, right?

What does that mean?

So in many ways we live,

and I'm taking this from Nils Gilman and Peter Schwartz,

and other great minds that came way before me,

we live in an official future.

Right now, the official future is one

that is very tech-centric, there's nothing wrong with that.

What we try to do on the show though,

is we try to push up against that and say,

the future isn't just technology, one,

and two, the futures, in the plural to come,

are made of different narratives.

And who we bring into the room,

and sometimes we can't bring everyone into the room,

but the job of the future today is to bring

as many different folks and points of view into the room.

One of those, we can think of that temporally

as everyone on the planet right now,

but to be a great ancestor means

you're bringing future generations into the room.

There's a segment that we do in Japan

with an amazing professor,

he does a thing called future design,

and so whenever they're kind of planning

and doing kind of local community policy planning

in Yahaba, but now it's gone global,

roughly 20% of the people in the room will dawn

these golden vests.

And when you're wearing the vests,

your job is no longer to advocate for policy

temporally for yourself today,

but for two generations out from now,

to bring them into the room.

So to be a great ancestor means to make decisions

that are not just in line with the needs of today,

but in lines of different generations to come,

and what will allow them to flourish

in a way that your activity today doesn't take away

from their ability to flourish in the future.

That's fantastic.

Catherine, I want to at least start

the last question with you,

what do you want people to take away from the show?

Like, what is the message?

I think the most important thing for me,

is for people to come away

feeling that they have agency to change the future.

We have this idea that the future is set,

and it's just coming at us fast,

and that's not the case, every decision that we make

changes what those futures possibilities are.

And instead of feeling depressed or doomerist

about the things that are going wrong right now,

I want people to say, oh look,

you know, there's a seaweed farmer,

there's, you know, a death doula,

there's someone doing mushroom packaging,

these are things that I've never thought about,

Maybe I could be a part of that.

And I really want

that if there's one thing we get across,

it's that you have agency to change the future.

Thank you all three of you, thank you so much for this.

Thank you for doing this, thank you for making this show

that I sincerely hope everyone in here will watch,

and also that like, you know, we'll be able to, yeah,

feed to the next super intelligent AI,

who will take care of us all benevolently, [chuckles]

whenever that happens to be.

So yes, thank you all so much.

Everybody. [Audience applauds]

Thank you, thank you Bjarke, thank you Catherine,

thank you Ari.

Much appreciated.",technology
"At this point, the Life is Strange formula is well established. Each game follows a young adult going through some kind of personal trauma, while also learning to deal with a newfound superpower, whether it’s time travel or telekinesis. So far it has worked in a few different flavors: the original felt a bit like an interactive Veronica Mars, while its sequel built on that with a bold and overtly political story. True Colors is the latest entry in the growing anthology, and it once again features a troubled kid with special abilities who’s struggling to keep it together. It also makes a big change by ditching the episodic format and releasing the complete story all at once

Aside from that, it doesn’t mess with the formula much, nor does it make the daring narrative leaps of LiS2. Instead, it feels like a refinement. It takes the best parts of Life is Strange — choice-driven gameplay, characters you’ll fall in love with, a vibe that’s like an interactive indie rock album — and applies them to a new dark mystery that’s hard to put down. And that’s a whole lot easier now that you can binge the whole thing.

True Colors centers on Alex Chen, a 21-year-old who has spent nearly a decade bouncing around the foster care system. At the outset of the game that’s about to change: she’s getting ready to move in with her estranged brother in an idyllic small town in Colorado. It’s an eccentric and charming place with a kick-ass record store, a pub run by a man full of fatherly wisdom, a dispensary with an art studio in the back, and stunning mountain views no matter which direction you look. After so long without a real home, it’s maybe the perfect place for Alex to settle down for a bit. She easily falls back into a familial routine with her brother — one of the first things they do is rock out in an embarrassing air guitar session — and quickly befriends seemingly everyone in town.

Of course, this is Life is Strange, so things don’t stay so peaceful for long. I won’t spoil the specifics, but there’s a significant death fairly early on (I can say from experience that even if you know it’s coming, it still hits really hard) that leads Alex down a rabbit hole of figuring out how it actually happened. At its core, True Colors is a classic small town murder mystery, the kind where everyone seems like they could be a suspect once you dig in a little. Eventually, you’ll learn that there’s a sinister history to the place, including a powerful corporation with a strong hold on the town.

What makes it feel distinctly like Life is Strange comes down to a combination of gameplay and tone. If you’ve never played any of these games before, they’re essentially interactive dramas, where you spend as much time watching events unfold as participating. Your interactions mostly come in two forms: making decisions and investigating. Often the game will present you with a binary choice that influences how the story plays out, or how other characters respond to Alex. That could mean intervening in a domestic squabble or choosing with whom to flirt. (True Colors presents two very appealing romantic options that can be hard to choose between.)

The twist here is Alex’s power, which allows her to see someone’s “aura.” Essentially, she can tell how someone is feeling by looking at them — they’ll glow different colors depending on mood — and then use that to delve further into their psyche. This can play out in a few different ways. Sometimes, she’s able to change someone’s emotional state by learning about them and saying or doing the right thing; other times she can use that information to help people in more practical ways. In one scene, Alex helps an amnesiac remember what they were doing. In another, she is able to talk a scared young boy into following her to safety. Her power feels perfectly in tune with the game. Life is Strange has always been a series about listening to and helping people; here it just becomes an overt gameplay mechanic.

True Colors also does an incredible job when it comes to pacing and tone. There are times when the action is so fast, and you have to make a hard decision in a split second, that my heart was truly racing. In other moments you can just lounge around on a dock thinking about life. The game lets you linger when needed, both with moments and characters, so you can fully understand them. Things also get incredibly dark, particularly in the later chapters, when Alex is forced to confront the innermost conflicts of both her friends and herself.

It balances this out with lots of chill, even playful moments; one chapter takes place almost entirely inside a goofy LARP, and one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game involves helping Alex figure out just what she wants to do with her life. The game jumps between horror and heartbreak, dad jokes and drama, with an ease that’s rare to see in games. True Colors is the kind of game where you’ll be as worried about whether your crush likes you as you are about solving the grisly crime at the center of the story.

The biggest change in True Colors comes not from how the game plays, but how it’s being released. Historically, the series has been episodic: each new entry is divided into chapters, which are then released periodically every month or so. It’s a great idea, but the realities of game development often meant there were huge gaps between episodes, making it hard for the story to maintain momentum. In True Colors, this is no longer the case: all five chapters are being released at once, and the story benefits from this kind of close connection, where you can see the ramifications of your choices without struggling to remember what happened last time.

The anthology format has helped keep Life is Strange fresh across three main entries, but it also comes with a significant risk. This is a series where so much relies on your investment in the characters; these stories work because you want to help characters like Max Caulfield and Sean Diaz live a better life. Luckily, despite a new setting and lead, True Colors has exactly that. I played through the entire thing in two sittings — not because I had to see how it ended, but because I needed to make sure that Alex was alright.",technology
"A California man pleaded guilty yesterday to securities fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of an official proceeding in connection with his scheme to defraud investors by making false and misleading statements about the purported development of a new, blood-based COVID-19 test, leading to millions of dollars in investor losses.

According to court documents, Keith Berman, 70, of Westlake Village, was the CEO and sole director of Decision Diagnostics Corp. (DECN), a public medical device company. Berman and DECN were in precarious financial condition in the lead up to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Berman wrote in internal emails that he needed a “new story” to “raise millions.” Additionally, Berman had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of company money on personal expenditures, despite publicly claiming not to take any compensation. Faced with these financial difficulties, from February through December 2020, Berman engaged in a scheme to defraud investors by falsely claiming that DECN had developed a 15-second test to detect COVID-19 in a finger prick sample of blood. Despite his claims to the investing public, Berman knew that no such test existed.

Berman also falsely told investors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was on the verge of approving DECN’s request for emergency use authorization of its purported COVID-19 test. In truth, Berman knew that his company was unwilling and unable to meet the clinical testing required by the FDA but concealed these material facts and misled investors.

As part of the alleged scheme, Berman used a fake persona to repeat false and misleading statements to investors on internet message boards, and to lull unsuspecting investors into inaction by refuting allegations of fraud and threatening potential whistleblowers with civil or criminal sanctions. Berman also obstructed a U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into his conduct, using another false online identity to surreptitiously direct an investor to write a series of false and threatening letters to the highest levels of SEC management, including the SEC Chairman.

Berman pleaded guilty to one count each of securities fraud, wire fraud, and obstruction of an official proceeding. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 12, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Criminal Investigations Group, and Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

USPIS and the FBI investigated the case.

Trial Attorneys Christopher Fenton, Kate T. McCarthy, and Matthew Reilly of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Justice Department’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form.",technology
"Google just launched its Gemini AI model. Want to try it out for free? A version of the model, called Gemini Pro, is available inside of the Bard chatbot right now. Also, anyone with a Pixel 8 Pro can use a version of Gemini in their AI-suggested text replies with WhatsApp now, and with Gboard in the future.

Only a sliver of Gemini is currently available. Future releases are expected to include multimodal capabilities, where a chatbot processes multiple forms of input and produces outputs in different ways. Just the text-based version has been added to Bard.

Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis Says Gemini Is a New Breed of AI Google’s new AI model Gemini launched today inside the Bard chatbot. It could go on to advance robotics and other projects, says Demis Hassabis, the AI executive leading the project.

Gemini is also only available in English, though Google plans to roll out support for other languages soon. As with previous generative AI updates from Google, Gemini is also not available in the European Union—for now.

Despite the premium-sounding name, the Gemini Pro update for Bard is free to use. With ChatGPT, you can access the older AI models for free as well, but you pay a monthly subscription to access the most recent model, GPT-4. Details on future plans for Gemini remain scarce. Google teased that its further improved model, Gemini Ultra, may arrive in 2024, and could initially be available inside an upgraded chatbot called Bard Advanced. No subscription plan has been announced yet, but for comparison, a monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus with GPT-4 costs $20.

How to Access Google’s Gemini Pro

Do you already have a Google account? Using Gemini inside of Bard is as simple as visiting the website in your browser and logging in. Google does not allow access to Bard if you are not willing to create an account. Users of Google Workspace accounts may need to switch over to their personal email account to try Gemini.

Remember that all of this is technically an experiment for now, and you might see some software glitches in your chatbot responses. One of the current strengths of Bard is its integration with other Google services, when it actually works. Tag @Gmail in your prompt, for example, to have the chatbot summarize your daily messages, or tag @YouTube to explore topics with videos. Our previous tests of the Bard chatbot showed potential for these integrations, but there are still plenty of kinks to be worked out.

So how is the anticipated Gemini Ultra different from the currently available Gemini Pro model? According to Google, Ultra is its “most capable mode” and is designed to handle complex tasks across text, images, audio, video, and code. The smaller version of the AI model, fitted to work as part of smartphone features, is called Gemini Nano, and it’s available now in the Pixel 8 Pro for WhatsApp replies.

As you experiment with Gemini Pro in Bard, keep in mind the things you likely already know about chatbots, such as their reputation for lying. Not sure where to even start with your prompts? Check out our guide to crafting better prompts for Google’s Bard.",technology

On December 9 last year, the weather in Brussels turned freezing. As a blanket of icy fog engulfed the city, police began a series of raids, rounding up key suspects in a corruption scandal that would rock the European Union to its core.

The suspects, who included the Parliament’s glamorous vice-president, Eva Kaili, were interrogated in custody in the hours and days that followed. Later, some received preliminary charges of membership of a criminal organization, corruption and money laundering.

A cache of police documents, seen by POLITICO, includes transcripts of the initial police interviews with four of the individuals suspected of being at the center of the case known as Qatargate: Pier Antonio Panzeri, Francesco Giorgi, Eva Kaili and Andrea Cozzolino.

Here’s what they said when they were first questioned about their role (or lack thereof) in alleged attempts by foreign governments to corrupt the heart of European Union democracy.

Pier Antonio Panzeri — Denial

Police seized Panzeri at his home at 10:02 a.m. on December 9. He would later confess to his part in the scandal, but in the two days following his arrest he stuck to a simple strategy: deny, deny, deny.

“What I took, I admit off the books, was my payment in return for consultancy and not with an aim at corruption,” he told police, according to a transcript of his statements on December 9, 2022.

Panzeri is a former MEP who left the Parliament in 2019 and founded an NGO. In his interview, he acknowledged he took money from Qatar but flatly denied criminality, framing his work as “classic lobbying.” He said he took €17,000 in cash per month from the Gulf state over several years, racking up more €600,000, but that his work for Qatar was not disclosed because the Gulf state wanted to keep things quiet. In failing to declare the money, Panzeri told police, he accepted he was “probably making a mistake.”

He also told police he only provided information and took “no step” in Qatar’s favor, and said he had worked on condition that the country improve its labor laws in the run-up to the football World Cup it planned to host at the end of 2022. “I give you a hand, and you make reforms,” he claimed to have told a top Qatari official. “Otherwise, your country won’t be marketable with regards to Europe.”

Recounting his career before politics as a union boss negotiating with companies on behalf of workers in Milan, Panzeri boasted of being a “talented” dealmaker, but said he was not a corruption mastermind. “I am not the one pulling the strings, if such a person exists,” he said.

Just over a month later, in January 2023, it emerged that Panzeri had admitted his guilt in a plea deal with prosecutors.

Marc Uyttendaele, a lawyer for Panzeri, wrote to POLITICO: “We do not comment on this case.”

Francesco Giorgi — Acceptance

Giorgi was arrested 40 minutes after Panzeri on the morning of December 9. In the hours that followed, he was keen to tell investigators about the journey that had brought him there. He came to Brussels, he said, as a starry-eyed Erasmus student in 2009 and found a position as an intern in the Parliament. From there, he went to work as an assistant for Panzeri, who was then an MEP.

“For me, Panzeri is a mentor,” he said in a conversation with police on December 9, 2022. “It’s thanks to him that I met my wife,” he added, referring to Eva Kaili, the former vice president of the Parliament who was arrested the same day, and with whom he has a young daughter.

Though he was working as an assistant to another MEP — Andrea Cozzolino, also a Qatargate suspect — when he was arrested, Giorgi was still moonlighting for Panzeri, helping him with his work with Qatar because he felt “indebted to him.” He denied any knowledge of or involvement in illicit activities. “We always paid our taxes,” he said of himself and Kaili.

Police informed Giorgi in a conversation the next day that they had arrested Kaili’s father, finding him in possession of a suitcase crammed with cash, and that more money had been found at the apartment Giorgi shared with Kaili.

His reaction was to spill the beans. Kaili, he said, knew about the provenance of the cash but was not “part of the network” of influence he and Panzeri had created on Qatar’s behalf. In later declarations, Giorgi would retract his early statement that Kaili had knowledge of the origin of the cash. “I will do everything that is necessary so my daughter can stay with her mother,” he told his interviewers.

Panzeri, he said, had struck a deal with Qatar to create a lobbying operation inside the Parliament. Giorgi helped set up the project and collected bags of money from Qatari emissaries in Brussels parking lots. Almost as an afterthought, he mentioned that Panzeri also worked for Morocco and Mauritania.

He expressed regret for getting involved in Panzeri’s scheme. “It was stressing me,” Giorgi said. “I understand it’s an unhealthy system.”

“It is a real relief to be able to talk about this,” he said as the interrogation concluded. “I have never loved luxury. I don’t know why I lost my way.”

Giorgi’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Eva Kaili — Bargaining

In her first interview with investigators, on December 10, 2022, Kaili said she was dumbfounded by the accusations. “I am at a point where I don’t recognize anyone anymore, even my partner,“ she said. She thought Giorgi was “an idealist, very kind,” adding he was short of cash — that he had struggled to contribute to common expenses.

She described the day of their arrest as one of utter panic: Her partner Giorgi has been seized, and her father too, while carrying a suitcase full of cash she had handed to him. Her baby daughter might be handed over to the social services.

On hearing Giorgi had been arrested and her car impounded, she thought he had been “in a car accident.” Then she spotted an article in a Belgian newspaper featuring Panzeri’s name alongside mention of a large sum of money, which reminded her that the former MEP had left a suitcase and some money at her place.

She said she imagined the money’s provenance might be “not good” and asked her father to get it out of her apartment in the suitcase, along with a phone and a laptop she found in Giorgi’s study. “Before that, I had never reflected on the origin of that money,” she said.

She denied being part of any network. Any decisions she made that might be favorable to Qatar, she argued, were official business on behalf of EU institutions eager to build a rapport with a country rich in oil and gas. “Everyone asked me to continue on this path [on this issue],” Kaili said.

In a second interview, nine days later, police zeroed in on the bags and the cash; the transcript includes crude drawings of bags and suitcases. Kaili said she partially filled Panzeri’s suitcase with money from Giorgi’s safe. She knew which money was Panzeri’s because he kept it bundled, while Giorgi kept his cash loose. She described another bag in the safe — her own — containing some €30,000 to €40,000. She kept it ready as a precaution, she said, “in case of a nuclear attack.”

Sven Mary, a lawyer for Kaili, stressed the need for accurate reporting but declined to comment further.

Kaili’s lawyers have launched a legal challenge against the case, alleging that Belgian authorities mishandled the evidence-gathering process, and prompting an internal investigation that is ongoing.

Andrea Cozzolino — Despair

Cozzolino’s conversation with Belgian police took place much later than the others, on June 21 this year, after his return to Brussels following months under house arrest in Naples.

“My life is ruined, my image is ruined,” the Italian MEP told police. “I have no desire to return to the Parliament. My political life is destroyed, destroyed, I have never had problems with the judicial system before, I was very well regarded in Italy, but my world has collapsed.”

He denied everything. He never did anything in favor of Qatar or Morocco in the Parliament. He did not receive €250,000 from Qatar to finance his 2019 EU election campaign. He did not meet the head of the Moroccan secret services. He did not hire Giorgi as part of a deal with Panzeri. He did not take instructions from the pair to defend Qatar at a Parliamentary committee meeting where the country’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri was grilled by MEPs ahead of the World Cup.

“I have the impression of having been tricked,” Cozzolino said as he emphasized the toll his involvement in the scandal had taken on his health.

He brushed off a suggestion that he used coded language when speaking to the Moroccan ambassador to Poland, whom police suspected of spearheading Rabat’s efforts to corrupt the Parliament. The words “suits and ties” did not refer to money, the MEP said. But he did give the ambassador four Marinella ties. “He loves ties,” Cozzolino said.

Dimitri de Beco, a lawyer for Cozzolino, told POLITICO that Cozzolino “didn’t know anything about Giorgi’s external activities (starting with the ones you mentioned). The only things he was aware of were Giorgi’s institutional activities regarding his duties as accredited assistant.”

Where Israel’s tanks have invaded southern Gaza

Israel’s renewed offensive has reached the outskirts of Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s largest city, from which thousands of civilians are now trying to flee.

Satellite imagery shows the clearest evidence so far of the extent of Israel’s ground offensive in southern Gaza, where armored vehicles can be seen moving toward Khan Younis from several directions. The Times obtained and analyzed the imagery, which was taken on Wednesday morning, from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite company.

Israeli tanks, vehicle tracks and defensive fortifications are visible in imagery taken on Sunday, showing that Israeli forces entered southern Gaza via the Kissufim crossing point sometime on Friday or Saturday. Israeli vehicles also crossed the border farther south, to the northeast of Khan Younis, according to a New York Times analysis of publicly available satellite imagery from Copernicus taken on Wednesday.

This sequence of images show how quickly the Israeli military has ramped up its operation around Khan Younis, where they believe Hamas leadership is sheltering after fleeing the northern part of the Gaza Strip.

Israeli commanders have described intense house-to-house combat with Hamas fighters in the densely populated city of Khan Younis. The city had more than 200,000 residents before the war, and has become more crowded in recent weeks as people fled the intense conflict in northern Gaza.

The military confrontations in Khan Younis are unfolding as humanitarian conditions have grown increasingly dire. Israel is ordering civilians — many who were already displaced from their homes in the north — to evacuate into ever-shrinking pockets of the coastal enclave and officials are struggling to get aid through. The United Nations has warned that shelters are far beyond capacity, forcing many people to sleep on the street or in empty lots.

Khan Younis is also under heavy aerial bombardment. One neighborhood to the northeast of the city, shown below, has more than two dozen large craters and numerous destroyed buildings, mirroring the destruction in northern Gaza.

Israel orders more evacuations in the south

Just over half of the total area of the Gaza Strip was under Israeli evacuation orders as of Sunday. Israel expanded its demands for evacuation in the south, telling those staying in central and eastern Khan Younis to leave, ahead of an expected ground invasion in the area.

The Gaza Strip is home to more than two million people and is already among the most densely populated areas of the world.

Hundreds of thousands of people fled to Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, in the first stage of the war. The expanded orders follow earlier demands to evacuate the large area east of Khan Younis that borders Israel and encompasses the agricultural villages of Al Qarara, Bani Suheila, Abasan and Khuza’a, as well as the order Israel gave in the first week of the war to evacuate all of northern Gaza.

Half of all buildings in northern Gaza are likely damaged or destroyed, according to satellite analysis estimates

An updated analysis of satellite imagery shows that in the month and a half since Israel’s war in Gaza started, about half of all buildings in the northern Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That proportion is up from roughly one-third of buildings estimated to have been damaged two weeks ago.

The destruction of buildings and other structures in northern Gaza has continued even as the Israeli military has established an increased presence there and continued its advance into Gaza City. Israeli forces have been steadily surrounding hospitals in northern Gaza, including Indonesian Hospital, which was struck early on Monday morning.

Israel says that Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza and was responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, has concealed bases inside hospitals, and it has begun releasing videos that it says support its assertion. Hamas has denied Israeli accusations that it uses civilian infrastructure and says Israel is committing war crimes by targeting hospitals.

More than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 56,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 20 to 26 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery collected on Nov. 18.

According to the analysis, at least 13,200 structures have also been damaged in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south. In recent days, some residents in and around Khan Younis in southern Gaza have also reported seeing evacuation orders, in the form of fliers addressed to residents of agricultural villages east of the city. Some areas in those villages, including Khuza’a and Bani Suheila, have sustained significant damage.

Residents of southern Gazan villages report receiving evacuation orders

In Khan Younis — the largest city in southern Gaza — some residents reported seeing fliers said to have been dropped by Israeli planes warning people in outlying villages to evacuate.

The fliers, images of which have circulated online for days, were addressed to residents of four agricultural villages north and east of the city, near the border with Israel: Al Qarara, Bani Suheila, Abasan and Khuza’a. The four villages make up a large geographic area in southern Gaza.

The villages are east of Salah al-Din Road, the main north-south artery, which people have been using to flee from the north. The origin of the images was not clear and the Israeli military declined to comment on them.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said early Saturday that there had been “intense strikes” by the Israelis in the south as well as “ground clashes” between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. The agency said that clashes took place in Khan Younis and near Rafah in southern Gaza, as well as in the north during the previous 24 hours.

Frequent clashes continue along Israel’s volatile border with Lebanon

Israel’s military and Hezbollah, an armed militant group and ally of Hamas operating in Lebanon, have continued to clash along Israel’s volatile northern border.

The escalating violence has stoked fears that Israel’s war in Gaza, which began after Hamas led sweeping attacks on Israelis on Oct. 7, could widen to another front and potentially draw in Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah. However, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told the political leader of Hamas in early November that Iran would not enter the war on Hamas’s behalf, according to Reuters.

Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech last week that the group would keep up pressure on Israeli forces and try to strike targets deeper into Israeli territory, but he stopped short of a war declaration.

Mr. Nasrallah previously described Hezbollah’s objective as exchanging fire with a portion of Israel’s military to keep it occupied along multiple fronts, reducing the burden on Hamas.

The border skirmishes have, for the most part, involved Israeli troops and Hezbollah militia members. A few civilians have been killed on either side of the border since Oct. 7, according to reports from Israel’s military and Lebanon’s state news agency, and thousands more have fled their homes in border-area villages.

Where Israeli vehicles are advancing into Gaza City

Israeli forces have continued to advance deep into Gaza City, fighting street battles with Hamas and surrounding battered hospitals, where conditions are increasingly dire. Tracks of Israeli military vehicles, indicating the broad outlines of the advance on the city from the north and the south, are visible in commercially available satellite imagery taken on Nov. 11.

Hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people have been trapped in Al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s largest, as Israeli tanks and troops battle Hamas fighters nearby. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that the hospital was no longer functioning, as three days “without electricity, without water and with very poor internet” had severely hurt its ability to provide care.

Israeli officials say that Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza as shields for its fighters, and that the Israeli military is targeting an underground Hamas command center beneath the Al-Shifa complex. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the existence of such a command center.

Israeli forces have reached at least three other hospitals in northern Gaza, including Al-Rantisi and Al-Nasr, which have been evacuated, and Al-Quds, which is no longer operational. Fighting near Al-Quds on Monday disrupted efforts to evacuate patients and made it difficult for medical staff to make it in and out.

Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers have been a longstanding issue. But the war between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has further stoked tensions in the West Bank. The territory is much bigger than Gaza and a more complex Palestinian-majority area, where a growing number of Israeli settlements have also taken root.

Many of the confrontations have broken out either between Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers, often after an Israeli-led arrest or raid, or they have broken out after attacks and physical intimidation by Israeli settlers.

Clashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops have also escalated, fanning fears that war could break out on a second front.

The confrontations have also become increasingly deadly. A large proportion of the civilian deaths occurred after demonstrations or protests turned violent. These included many instances in which Palestinians threw stones at Israeli forces, who then responded with tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, stun grenades or live ammunition, or a combination of those. A number of deaths also occurred during direct attacks in which Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinians.

The data does not include episodes of violence that have occurred since Nov. 3, including Israeli military raids in the city of Jenin on Thursday, where 14 Palestinians were killed, according to Palestinian officials.

The data was compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a crisis monitoring organization, which collected information about political violence in the West Bank by examining reports from governments, social media, and local and national news services.

The map above does not include cases of looting, land seizure or property destruction in which physical violence was not reported. But these sorts of episodes have also increased in frequency since Oct. 7, often targeting herders and Bedouin communities and destroying homes or sources of livelihood, like olive tree groves.

More than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including entire herding communities, have been forcibly displaced from their homes since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has also been tracking the conflict.

Strikes hit hospitals, schools and other shelters for displaced people in the Gaza Strip

Israeli strikes have continued to batter the Gaza Strip since Israel’s ground invasion began 13 days ago. As the Israeli military has encircled Gaza City and reached deep into the city, air and ground strikes have hit locations throughout the enclave where thousands of displaced people are known to be sheltering, including hospitals and schools.

Attacks with known fatalities on hospitals and schools, Oct. 28 through Nov. 8 The New York Times

At least two strikes since the invasion have hit Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, where the United Nations has said 60,000 people are sheltering. On Nov. 3, Israel struck near the hospital’s entrance, killing 15 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry and the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israel has said that Hamas has a command center under the hospital and that the strike targeted an ambulance being used by a terrorist cell.

On Monday, a strike on the top floor at the same hospital killed one child, said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the head of the hospital. Israel denied responsibility for the Monday attack.

Gaza’s health ministry said a strike on Saturday killed 15 people at Al Fakhura school, where 16,000 people were sheltering. Other strikes in the past 13 days have hit a medical complex that contains Al Rantisi Hospital and Al Nasr Children’s Hospital, which has been sheltering about 16,000 displaced people, as well as Al Quds Hospital, which has been sheltering 14,000.

Reports from Wafa, the state-run news agency of the Palestinian Authority, have additionally mentioned strikes on or in the vicinity of at least three other hospitals and five other schools in the past 13 days.

Many strikes since the invasion have also hit densely populated, developed neighborhoods in Gaza that are designated as refugee camps, which are home to Palestinians and their descendants who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1940s war that surrounded the creation of Israel.

It is unclear how many people remain in each of Gaza’s refugee camp neighborhoods, particularly in the north, since tens of thousands of residents followed Israel’s orders to evacuate to southern Gaza. What is certain is that many others have been unable to flee safely, and strikes in both the north and the south have resulted in numerous casualties.

Strikes on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 on Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 195 people and injured hundreds more, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office, and left a 40-foot-wide crater. The Israeli military said that the strike had targeted Hamas militants, including a central figure in the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Reports from Wafa have also mentioned attacks on the Jabaliya neighborhood on several other days, some with dozens of fatalities. The casualty counts could not immediately be independently confirmed.

Refugee camp neighborhoods in the south, below the evacuation boundary established by Israel, have also been struck, including multiple times in Nuseirat, Bureij and Maghazi. A strike on Maghazi over the weekend killed at least 47 people, Gaza’s health ministry said, with the death toll expected to rise. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strike.

Overall in Gaza, about 1.5 million people are internally displaced, according to a United Nations estimate.

The Israeli military has continued to pummel the Gaza Strip, and particularly northern Gaza, with strikes even as ground troops have moved toward Gaza City over the past week and a half. Israel said on Monday that it had struck about 450 targets in Gaza in the previous 24 hours. Israel has encircled Gaza City, effectively cutting northern Gaza off from the south.

More than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began a month ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.

Throughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 38,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 13 to 18 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery ending on Sunday.

The Israeli military on Monday reiterated its demand that residents of northern Gaza move south, and an evacuation corridor was reopened for four hours. United Nations monitors reported about 5,000 people left the north during that window, while others were unable to make the journey. Because of heavy damage to roads, the only option was to flee on foot, according to a report from the United Nations’ humanitarian and emergency relief office.

The damage assessment shows that Israeli forces have continued to strike in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line, though damage there is less concentrated than in the north.

In an interview with ABC News that aired Monday night, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated that he expected Israel to have an “overall security responsibility” over Gaza for an “indefinite period” once the fighting there is over, though he did not say who he thought should govern the enclave if Hamas is eliminated.

Frequent fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border continues as tensions mount

Intense clashes have escalated for weeks along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, stoking fears of a war between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political party that is an ally of Hamas.

On Friday, in his first remarks since the start of Israel’s war with Hamas, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, described the group’s objective as a controlled battle along the border rather than an all-out war. But he also promised an eye for an eye on civilian deaths, raising concerns that the militia’s attacks would expand beyond military targets.

Lebanon’s state news agency said Sunday that four civilians, three of them children, who were traveling in a car in southern Lebanon were killed by an Israeli strike.

Israel and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly since Oct. 7, the date of Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel. Mr. Nasrallah said that Hezbollah’s aim was to keep Israeli forces tied up along the northern border with Lebanon, reducing the burden on Hamas.

Where Israel’s invasion has cut Gaza in two

Israeli ground forces have reached across the full width of the Gaza Strip, satellite imagery shows, encircling Gaza’s largest city and cutting off the roads running south.

The imagery, taken on Friday morning by Planet Labs, a commercial satellite provider, shows how far Israel has moved into Gaza and the scale of its southern line of attack, where at least five groups of armored vehicles are visible south of Gaza City.

And the imagery confirms statements from Israel’s military on Thursday night that it had surrounded Gaza City from several directions. Armored vehicles can be seen just 300 meters from Al-Rasheed Street, a coastal road that is one of the two main north-south routes in the Gaza Strip.

It is unclear how deep Israeli forces have entered into Gaza City itself. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on social media on Thursday that Israeli forces were already “beyond the outskirts” of the city.

Israel’s recent advances have surrounded Gaza City above ground, but Hamas also relies on a network of tunnels, thought to be hundreds of miles long, to move around the enclave. Israel is targeting the tunnels with airstrikes, but it is hard to know what damage it has caused to the network so far.

The imagery also shows entire dense neighborhoods in northern Gaza that look mostly leveled, reflecting the extraordinary level of devastation from Israeli bombardment over the past several weeks. At least a quarter of all buildings in northern Gaza appear damaged or destroyed as of Sunday, an analysis of satellite imagery found.

Where Israeli forces are advancing toward Gaza City

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday indicates that Israeli ground troops are continuing to close in on Gaza City.

Heavy-vehicle tracks extend deep into the Gaza Strip along three fronts, the satellite image shows: three miles past Gaza’s northern border along the coast, 1.5 miles past the border in the northeast and along a westward stretch south of Gaza City, nearly reaching the coast.

Israeli soldiers have been encroaching from the north, east and northeast in an effort to cut the northern part of the enclave off from the south. Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said that it had “completed the encirclement of Gaza City” and had advanced beyond the city’s outskirts.

The military wing of Hamas, Al Qassam Brigades, did not confirm the claim, but said Thursday on Telegram that it had fired on Israeli forces near the Shati area along the coast and near Juhor ad Dik, close to Gaza’s eastern border.

In the six days since Israel began its ground invasion, the Israeli military has continued its intensive aerial bombardment of northern Gaza. Several airstrikes earlier this week, which Israel said had targeted Hamas operatives, hit the densely populated Jabaliya neighborhood, leveling whole blocks.

At least a quarter of buildings in northern Gaza are damaged, analysis estimates

Tens of thousands of buildings in Gaza, including at least a quarter of all buildings in northern Gaza, appear damaged or destroyed, according to an analysis of satellite imagery. The assessment offers a newly detailed picture of the widespread devastation caused by the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the past several weeks.

While only an estimate, the spatial analysis indicates the enormous destructiveness of Israel’s bombing campaign, which has become one of the most intense of the 21st century. Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gazan health officials.

Between 38,200 and 44,500 buildings throughout the Gaza Strip are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war, according to the analysis, by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center.

The analysis includes damage from the beginning of the war until Sunday, before a strike hit a densely populated residential area in Jabaliya on Tuesday.

Wide swaths of Gaza City and the surrounding area have been damaged, with the greatest damage concentrated north of the city, according to the assessment, which identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery. Throughout Gaza, about 14 percent of buildings appear to be damaged or destroyed.

Since Oct. 25, the Israeli military’s aerial bombardment has damaged many homes and residential buildings, as well as commercial buildings, in northern Gaza. Israeli strikes also hit near Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City, where thousands were seeking refuge.

The analysis shows that Israel has continued to strike southern Gaza even as it has renewed warnings for civilians to move there from the north.

Where Israeli troops are encircling Gaza City

Israel’s military appears to be approaching Gaza City from at least three sides. Photos, videos and satellite imagery show lines of armored vehicles advancing from Gaza’s northern border and taking up positions near a major road farther south.

Israel has provided limited details about the invasion, four days into what an Israeli official described as an “extended ground operation.” But imagery verified by The Times indicates large groups of tanks and other armored vehicles making their way deep into Gaza, as Israel’s military has continued to strike nearby buildings from the air.

In northwest Gaza, a satellite image taken on Monday morning by Planet Labs shows large groups of armored vehicles advancing about three miles south of the northern border near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Groups of vehicles can be seen amassed in open spaces of the densely populated area of Al Karama, north of Gaza City, less than two miles north of the crowded Shati refugee camp. Many nearby buildings appear to have been heavily damaged or completely destroyed by airstrikes.

Photographs also show a second group of armored vehicles near the city of Beit Hanoun, on the northeast edge of the Gaza Strip. Beit Hanoun had already been significantly damaged by airstrikes in the past several weeks.

Farther south, a video taken by Palestinian media worker Youssef Al Saifi on Monday morning, and verified by The Times, showed an Israeli armored vehicle firing on and destroying a car along Salah al-Din, Gaza’s main north-south road. The car was carrying a family, Mr. Al Saifi said. Satellite imagery from around the same time showed groups of Israeli armored vehicles positioned near the road.

Palestinian health officials say more than 8,000 people have been killed in Gaza, many of them children, since Israel began launching retaliatory airstrikes in response to a Hamas attack on Oct. 7.

Where Israeli military videos show ground forces entering Gaza

Few details have emerged of the Israeli military advance into Gaza, where internet connections and phone lines have been almost entirely cut off. But videos released by Israel’s military and geolocated by The Times indicate at least three separate places where Israeli troops have crossed the border into northern Gaza over the past few days.

Israeli military officials said on Saturday that troops remained in northern Gaza on Saturday evening after advancing into it on Friday. This marked a departure from the military’s earlier releases, which had indicated that troops had exited the areas depicted in the videos after conducting strikes.

While basic details of the operation remain shrouded in secrecy, video footage released by Israel’s military on Saturday showed lines of tanks operating on the Gaza side of the northern border, along with clouds of smoke rising from significant explosions.

Farther south, a line of tanks can be seen in footage released by Israel on Friday traveling west toward the village of Juhor ad Dik, southeast of Gaza City.

Buildings, including what appear to be houses and apartment buildings, are seen being bombarded in an area about one mile long in Juhor ad Dik. The village is just north of the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south.

Activity shown in an Israeli military video posted Friday Israeli tanks on the ground south of Gaza City, traveling west. Israeli tanks firing from the shore in northern Gaza. Bombing of an apartment building south of Gaza City. Bombardment of buildings in the village of Juhor ad Dik.

The ground advance on Friday was accompanied by a particularly intense round of Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza, as well as a widespread communication blackout that has made it difficult to assess the extent of the military action. So far, the maneuver appears more limited than some experts had predicted.

Hamas’s armed wing confirmed on Friday night and Saturday afternoon that its forces were fighting with Israeli soldiers inside Gaza.

A new look at where Israel has hit Gaza

An analysis of satellite imagery shows the tremendous structural damage that northern Gaza has sustained since Oct. 17, adding to already significant damage from the preceding 11 days. The Israeli military said Wednesday that it had struck more than 7,000 targets inside Gaza.

Photographs taken in Gaza show the enormous range of buildings damaged by strikes in the past week, which include bakeries, a supermarket, a restaurant and many houses and residential buildings. The 19-day bombing campaign has become one of the most intense of the 21st century.

The area around Gaza City has been hit particularly hard. On the morning of Oct. 23, smoke blanketed much of that region. A soft drink manufacturing facility in an eastern area of the city, its roof covered with solar panels, was burning.

Over the past two weeks, Israel has ramped up airstrikes in southern Gaza even after demanding the relocation of hundreds of thousands of residents of northern Gaza to the south. The increase in strikes in the south also coincides with the arrival of aid convoys through the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. These maps do not capture strikes that did not result in damage to manmade structures.

Deadliest period for Palestinians in the West Bank in 15 years

More Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past few weeks than in any similar period in at least the past 15 years, according to Palestinian health authorities and historical data from the United Nations.

Israeli forces and settlers have killed 95 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, health officials said, a surge in violence in what was already a particularly deadly year in the West Bank. One Israeli soldier was also killed in clashes.

Sources: U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (historical figures), Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank (figures since Oct. 7).

Most of the Palestinian deaths in the West Bank have been in clashes with Israeli forces, while others were the result of settler attacks.

Masked settlers shot and killed three Palestinians in the village of Qusra on Oct. 11, according to Palestinian health officials. At a funeral procession for the victims the next day, settlers attacked again, killing two more Palestinians, a father and son.

The Israeli military carried out a rare airstrike in the West Bank on a mosque in Jenin on Saturday night, killing two. Israel’s military said it was targeting a “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used to organize an attack.

A raid by Israeli forces on the Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday ended in the deaths of 13 Palestinians, including five children, as well as an Israeli soldier. The soldier was the first Israeli to have died in the West Bank since Oct. 7, according to U.N. data.

“We are extremely alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank and the increase in unlawful use of lethal force,” said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk.

Intensifying clashes on the Israel-Lebanon border

As Israeli forces prepare for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, frequent clashes along Israel’s northern border have amplified fears of a broader conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran.

Israeli authorities said on Sunday that they planned to evacuate 14 additional villages near the Lebanese border. The announcement was an expansion of an earlier evacuation order for communities in the area amid intensifying skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.

Hezbollah has increased its attacks aimed at northern Israel in recent days, and Israel has retaliated in southern Lebanon. But it is not possible to attribute all of the reported clashes individually to one side or the other.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Sunday that he did not know whether Hezbollah would join the conflict, but said it would result in “devastating consequences to Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon” if it did.

Naim Qassem, Hezbollah’s deputy chief, said on Saturday that the clashes near the border were keeping Israeli troops tied down in the north instead of leaving them free to deploy against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

First aid trucks move through Rafah crossing as southern Gaza is pummeled by strikes

The first convoy of aid trucks moved through the Rafah crossing on Saturday at Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The convoy of 20 trucks came after days of intense negotiations.

Satellite imagery from Tuesday showed crowds in Gaza waiting at the gate, aid trucks stuck in Egypt and several craters where U.N. officials said Israeli strikes had damaged the road.

Source: Planet Labs

The convoy of aid, which the World Health Organization warned would “barely begin to address the escalating health needs” in Gaza, comes as conditions have further deteriorated in southern Gaza. With clean drinking water in short supply, many Gazans have resorted to drinking polluted water.

The Israeli military has intensified strikes throughout the region over the past week, despite ordering the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the south last Friday.

Israel has hit dozens of targets in the south since Oct. 13, according to The Times’s reporting, news imagery and WAFA, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority — a rival of Hamas that administers parts of the Israel-occupied West Bank. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Thursday that at least 81 Palestinians had been killed in southern Gaza in the previous 24 hours.

Gazan authorities also reported Israeli airstrikes throughout the week in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, as well as Deir al Balah in central Gaza, which also falls below the evacuation zone. In photos and videos, many children appeared to be among those killed. Gazan authorities have also reported that at least 21 members of the same family died in one Israeli strike.

About one million Gazans have been displaced from their homes since the beginning of the conflict, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, some 367,500 in central and southern Gaza. While the exact number and location of internally displaced people who evacuated from the north is unclear, satellite imagery and photos show that, in at least one instance, tents were erected in the past week in the courtyard of a U.N.-run vocational training center.

How Israel is preparing for an invasion

The Israeli military has outlined plans to launch a ground invasion of Gaza soon, with tens of thousands of soldiers ordered to capture Gaza City and wipe out the top leadership of Hamas. Here’s how Israel is preparing for the invasion.

Israel deployed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles to two fields north of Gaza, which could be seen in satellite imagery captured earlier this week.

Source: Planet Labs Imagery from Oct. 15

The sites are not a secret: Photographers have been allowed access to the vehicles, which arrived at the site sometime between Oct. 8 and Oct. 14, according to imagery from Planet Labs.

Photographs taken at the same location on Saturday show a range of armored vehicles, including Merkava tanks, armored personnel carriers and militarized bulldozers.

Sergey Ponomarev for The New York Times

The military buildup seen in these images is about four miles north of the Erez Crossing, the primary entry point on Gaza’s northern border. The Erez Crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces recaptured it following its seizure by Hamas fighters on Oct. 7.

While an exact accounting of every part of Israel’s buildup is not possible, Israeli tanks have also been seen in other locations. Tanks and armored vehicles were photographed on Oct. 14 at a repair center near Be’eri, about two miles north of the site of the music festival Hamas attacked.

Ahead of the ground invasion, Israel has demanded that the entire population of northern Gaza — some 1.1 million people — evacuate to the southern half of the territory. But many people are unable to move, and on Tuesday Israel said it had intensified its bombing in cities in southern Gaza, leading some Palestinians to consider returning home.

An updated look at where Israel has hit Gaza

An updated analysis of satellite imagery shows areas in Gaza that have been significantly damaged in the first 11 days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes.

Northern Gaza has continued to receive the brunt of the attacks in recent days, as airstrikes pummeled large parts of Beit Hanoun and the regions near Rimal and Al Jadidah. Strikes also inflicted more damage on the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, both of which were previously hit in the earliest days of the war.

Areas along the Salah Al-Din Road, one of two major routes used by Gazans escaping to the southern part of the territory, were also significantly damaged. Dozens of civilians were killed by strikes as they attempted to flee south, according to the Interior Ministry in Gaza.

On Friday, Israeli officials warned 1.1 million civilians living in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south for their own safety, even as Israeli forces intensified bombings in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Pockets of Abasan al-Kabira and Khuza’a were also damaged, along with parts of the Nuseirat, Bureij and Rafah refugee camps.

The Israeli military has said that its airstrikes have targeted command centers, operatives and hide-outs that belong to Hamas, including “terror targets” in Khan Younis and Rafah.

Living conditions have deteriorated rapidly in southern Gaza as food, clean water and other essential supplies dwindle. On Wednesday, President Biden announced that Egypt would allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a test to see if a more sustained flow can begin.

The analysis does not yet show the damage to the Ahli Arab Hospital campus in Gaza City, where hundreds of people were killed in an explosion on Tuesday evening that Israeli officials and Palestinian fighters each blamed on the other.

The aftermath of the hospital explosion in Gaza

Daylight Wednesday made clear the scale of the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital, even as the exact cause remained in dispute. Over the past week, hundreds of families, fleeing airstrikes, had sought refuge on the campus of the hospital. Photos and videos showed the extent of some of the damage.

A small impact crater, caused by the munition that hit the area, was visible close to the parking lot. Damage could be seen on some of the surrounding buildings and structures: roof tiles were blown off a church, an ambulance port and a building. Windows in a building housing a cancer diagnostic center were shattered.

The imagery also showed more than a dozen vehicles in the parking lot that were burned, overturned or otherwise damaged. Parts of the parking lot were charred, and fencing was destroyed.

The hospital was also hit on Oct. 14, which damaged the diagnostic center and injured four staff members. Video and images reviewed by The Times indicate that most of the damage shown here was likely caused by Tuesday’s explosion.

Two hours before the explosion, the courtyard was filled with people singing for peace and children playing, Hosam Naoum, Jerusalem’s Anglican archbishop, told reporters on Wednesday.

A frame from a video taken Wednesday showed some of the personal items left by people who had been sheltering in the courtyard.

Gazan officials have said that hundreds of people were killed in the explosion, but the exact casualty numbers were unclear. Many of those killed were women and children, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza.

Explosion at Gaza hospital kills hundreds, Palestinians say

Hundreds of people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to Gazan officials. Palestinian officials said the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike, while Israeli officials blamed a rocket launch by militants in Gaza.

The New York Times

As of Wednesday morning local time, the precise death toll was still unclear. Many civilians had been sheltering at the hospital. The Civil Defense in Gaza said medical teams were overwhelmed and unable to respond adequately because the hospital was so badly damaged.

The Israeli Defense Forces said on Tuesday night that its intelligence indicated the Islamic Jihad was responsible for a failed rocket launch. A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad denied the assertion, saying the group’s armed wing was not operating in the area.

Protests arise after deadly hospital blast in Gaza

Anger over the hospital blast in Gaza led to a spate of protests across the Middle East and North Africa on Tuesday night, fueling tensions in a region already rocked by war.

People took to the streets from neighboring Lebanon and Jordan to Morocco. Protests were also reported in Europe, South America and the United States.

Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that has fought escalating clashes with Israel in recent days, denounced the hospital strike as an Israeli “massacre.” The group called for a “day of rage” on Wednesday against Israel and President Biden’s visit, according to a statement.

The Israeli military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the blast had resulted from a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas.

Violence along the border between Israel and Lebanon

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified over the weekend along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, fueling fears of a wider regional conflict. Civilians were killed on both sides of the border.

The New York Times

On Monday, the Israeli military announced it would evacuate all residents who live within two kilometers of the border with Lebanon, strengthening orders from Sunday that civilians must stay close to safe rooms in their homes.

Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a strike that killed at least one Israeli civilian and injured three others on Sunday, saying the attack was in response to the death of a Reuters cameraman, Issam Abdallah, on Friday, as well as two other civilians killed in a separate strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday when their house was hit by shelling.

Prime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon blamed Mr. Abdallah’s death on Israel, whose military said it was investigating.

On Sunday, a rocket hit the headquarters for U.N. peacekeeping in southern Lebanon. No injuries were reported.

Outside of Gaza, instability and uncertainty throughout the region

As attention has been focused in and around Gaza, tensions have mounted elsewhere in the region.

Since Oct. 7, the Israeli military and Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militant group allied with Hamas, have each carried out multiple attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has been seeking to prevent Iran from moving weapons through Syria, and attacks on Syrian airports have been reported. Egypt’s Rafah border crossing remained blocked as of Sunday, preventing Gazans as well as foreign nationals from escaping Gaza.

Casualties in the West Bank have not approached the levels in Gaza. But at least 61 Palestinians have been killed with clashes with the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that some of those people were shot and killed by Israeli forces during confrontations or protests, while others were civilians killed in a series of attacks by settlers. Israeli officials have not commented on specific incidents but said they were conducting raids in the West Bank to arrest people linked to Hamas.

Where an explosion killed Gazans trying to evacuate

Hours after Israel ordered civilians to leave northern Gaza and designated a corridor for evacuees, at least one explosion occurred on the route. Videos taken shortly after 5 p.m. on Friday on Salah Al-Din Road show that at least nine people, some of them children, lay motionless, some maimed and bleeding, on the road near four burning cars.

Yusuf Al-Hindi, a medic with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza who responded to the scene, said he saw about 30 dead bodies.

The health ministry has said at least 70 people were killed while they were attempting to follow Israel’s evacuation edict. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist and spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said while there was no intentional targeting, he could not categorically deny that the explosion was caused by Israeli fire. The New York Times was not able to determine the cause of the explosion.

An initial look at where Israel has hit Gaza

A new analysis of satellite imagery shows an estimate of the areas in Gaza that were significantly damaged in the first six days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes. The Israeli Air Force said it dropped about 6,000 bombs throughout Gaza over that time.

Northern Gaza bore the brunt of the damage from the attacks, according to the analysis by satellite remote sensing scientists. Many buildings in the Rimal neighborhood were leveled by Israeli airstrikes, along with large sections of Beit Hanoun. Pockets of the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, where dozens were killed, also sustained damage.

Israel has said that its airstrikes have targeted centers of operations of Hamas, and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say that many innocent civilians have also been killed or injured.

Early Friday morning, the Israeli military called for the entire population of densely populated northern Gaza to evacuate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours, in what appeared to be another step in readying for a ground invasion. The maps above show estimates of damage through Thursday evening, before the call for mass evacuation.

Over the past week, about 2,228 people have been killed in Gaza, with 8,744 more injured, according to Palestinian officials.

The scale of destruction in Gaza

Israeli forces bombarded the Gaza Strip with an extraordinary number of airstrikes in recent days, a campaign both deadlier and more widespread than in recent conflicts. Some 6,000 bombs have been dropped since Oct. 7, the Israeli Air Force said.

While a full accounting of the airstrikes is currently impossible, a partial record shows the wide range of the damage. The Times compiled the attacks from verified imagery, tallies from Palestinian and U.N. aid groups and statements from Israeli military officials.

Israel has said its retaliatory strikes, in response to terror attacks on Oct. 7, are focused on targets belonging to Hamas and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say many innocent civilians are also being killed or injured.

The Israeli Air Force has said the airstrikes have killed “hundreds of terrorists.” While it is impossible to verify that claim, at least seven of the houses that were destroyed belonged to leaders of Hamas, according to an analysis of on-the-ground reports from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, an independent organization based in Gaza.

Overall, more than 1,500 Gazans have been killed in the current conflict, according to the Gazan Ministry of Health.

Israel demands that northern Gaza evacuate

Israel’s military issued a statement early Friday warning the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours.

The statement named the marker dividing the north from south as Wadi Gaza, a strip of wetlands that curves across the Gaza Strip.

The U.N. warned that relocating over one million people would lead to “devastating humanitarian consequences.” A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said it has “strongly appealed” for the order to be rescinded to avoid making “what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”

Palestinian death toll so far greatly exceeds those of recent conflicts

Far more Palestinians have been killed after six days of Israeli airstrikes than in the first days of recent rounds of fighting, indicating the enormous scale of the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip.

Sources: Palestinian Ministry of Health; Gazan Health Ministry (2023 deaths) Note: Shows casualties in past clashes that lasted at least a week.

The Gazan Health Ministry said Thursday that 1,417 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. Those retaliatory strikes have come after attacks by Hamas in southern Israel killed more than 1,200 people, the deadliest assault in the country in more than half a century. It was not immediately clear how many of those killed in Gaza may have been militants.

A U.N. official warned Gaza is “facing a huge disaster” as Israel has cut off water and electricity supplies to the territory and continues to pummel the 140-square-mile strip with strikes.

Over the past 15 years, far more Palestinians have been killed than Israelis in confrontations between the two. In 2014, most of the more than 2,000 Palestinians killed in a 50-day war with Israel were civilians, according to data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The war also ended in the deaths of 73 Israelis.

Israel plugs border with Gaza and readies possible ground invasion

On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had regained control of the region right outside Gaza and designated it a closed military zone.

Source: Israeli Defense Forces The New York Times

Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces, said Israeli troops had plugged the holes in the barrier along the border that had been breached Saturday when Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel. “We are guarding it closely and making sure Hamas terrorists are not infiltrating again,” Mr. Conricus said.

About 300,000 soldiers are assembling near the Gaza Strip for what could be a major ground invasion of the territory. Mr. Cornicus said their mission was to make sure that Hamas “at the end of this war won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians.”

Gaza is tiny, crowded and hard to escape

The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. More than two million people live inside the sliver of land, just 25 miles long and 7.5 miles at its widest. The confined quarters make it nearly impossible to avoid civilian casualties when airstrikes are launched against the region.

Sources: OpenStreetMap; United Nations By The New York Times

On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its strikes against the coastal territory would be “bigger than before and more severe” because of the scale of the incursion by Hamas, which began Saturday. Israel has struck more than a thousand targets in Gaza so far, leveling apartment buildings, mosques and a marketplace.

At least 200,000 residents of Gaza have been displaced from their homes, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the scale of the humanitarian disaster is expected to get worse.

Since Hamas seized control of the area in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been under a blockade that restricts the import of goods that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving.

Israel’s defense minister intensified these restrictions on Monday, cutting off flows of electricity, food, water and fuel into the area.

Israeli attacks on mosques and other targets in Gaza

Israel launched a series of retaliatory strikes against Gaza on Monday morning, hitting several mosques and a marketplace. While the death toll is not known, videos from the market, in the Jabaliya refugee camp, showed bodies on the ground and people rushing to find survivors.

The Israeli military said it struck more than 500 targets in Gaza from Sunday night and into Monday.

At least four of the destroyed mosques were in the Shati refugee camp, one of the most densely populated areas of the already densely populated Gaza strip. The Israel military has said that Hamas operates out of civilian targets, including one of the mosques it struck today.

Fighting for control of communities near Gaza

Israeli soldiers were still fighting militants in at least six locations in southern Israel near the border with Gaza on Monday morning local time. An Israeli military spokesman said it had regained control of all the communities around 11:30 a.m., but there were still clashes on the ground after the announcement.

Lt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces said that not all of the breaches in the border fence had been fully closed, and more militants could still be crossing into Israeli territory from Gaza.

Deadliest day of attacks on Israel in country’s history

More people died in Israel in a single day than any other day since Israel became a state, according to Israel’s foreign press office. Around 700 Israelis had died since attacks began on Saturday, according to Israel’s foreign ministry as of 10:20 p.m. local time on Sunday. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 413 Palestinians had been killed.

Both sides are continuing attacks, and if Israel uses the same playbook it has in recent conflicts and clashes last more than a few days, the Palestinian death toll will be disproportionate. In recent confrontations, far more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis than Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.

The U.N. reported that 11 Israelis were killed in 2021, the year of the most recent conflict that lasted longer than a week. That conflict began after the Israeli police raided the Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, prompting rocket fire from Gaza. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, leading to 349 Palestinian casualties in 2021, including several dozen children.

The U.N. includes in its database Palestinians and Israelis who were killed or injured in conflicts since 2008 in either Israel or the Palestinian territories, which include the West Bank. Information on casualties is collected and entered by field staff and validated by multiple sources.

Israel evacuates civilians from towns bordering Gaza

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman, said the Israel Defense Forces were evacuating all civilians from the 24 villages near the Gaza border. The move is an indication that Israel might be preparing for an operation inside the Palestinian coastal territory.

Hamas fired thousands of rockets toward Israeli cities, and Palestinian militants crossed into southern Israel, killing civilians and holding Israelis hostage.

Israel retaliated with major strikes across the blockaded Gaza Strip, leveling multistory buildings, including a residential building with approximately 100 units.

At least 2,200 rockets were fired into Israeli airspace in the early hours of the assault, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman. Israel’s emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it had received reports of Hamas rockets landing as far north as Tel Aviv. The exact location of many rocket strikes is unknown.

"All three people said the stakes have escalated in the president’s mind as he’s watched the Republican Party remain in Trump’s thrall despite Jan. 6 and the revelations about what his predecessor has in store for the future.

“It’s coming back full circle — that in the president’s mind, this is the moral authority for the race. This is an existential threat. This is the reason he ran initially, and the reason — with Donald Trump running — he’s running again,” said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster for Biden’s campaign in 2020.

“The president has always believed that it was his duty to get the nation beyond Trump,” said one of the three people close to him, who spoke with Biden about his views on Trump and was granted anonymity to speak about private discussions. “He had hoped 2020 would have done it but it didn’t. So he has to do it again.”

Some Democrats have urged the reelection team to highlight other issues. This past weekend, a group of the party’s governors used its annual retreat to urge Biden to focus on issues like abortion, not Trump.

But while the Biden camp will continue to draw issue-specific contrasts, the president himself has made clear he wants to frame the election ahead as a battle for democracy itself. The GOP frontrunner continues to provide ample opportunity for Biden to return to this familiar theme.

This issue fueled Biden’s successful 2020 run, which he deemed “a battle for the soul of the nation.” And despite pushback from some Democrats, Biden leaned in hard again on that argument during last year’s midterms, warning that the extremist “MAGA Republicans” posed a threat to the republic’s foundation and rights.

Biden’s candid remarks Tuesday at a string of Boston fundraisers both reflected another example of the president saying something unscripted that surprised staff but also a window into his true thinking, according to the three people close to him.

“If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” Biden said. “But we cannot let him win.”

Biden then struck a grave tone, warning that he’s “running against an election-denier-in-chief,” who is “determined to destroy American democracy.”

“Trump’s not even hiding the ball anymore,” Biden told the crowd. “He’s telling us exactly what he wants to do. He’s making no bones about it.”

As early as 2021, Biden began having repeated conversations with allies that he would need to run again to prevent Trump from reclaiming the Oval Office. And like he did in 2020, Biden has steadfastly believed that he was the only Democrat who could beat him — though on Wednesday, he noted “probably 50” others in the party could beat Trump next year.

“Folks have forgotten a lot of anxiety that they had about a second Trump term in 2020,” said Brandon Weathersby, the presidential communications director at American Bridge 21st Century, a top Dem super PAC. “And I believe as he continues to talk about his plans — and again, be very explicit about his plans to install an authoritarian regime — that does make it that much more salient for voters as we talk about it, and as we try to lay out the choice for voters in November.”

Since declaring his candidacy in 2019, Biden has repeatedly touched on the idea that the nation’s democracy was under attack — and believed that voters would respond. His triumph in 2020 and the Democrats’ strong 2022 showing has validated that approach, his campaign believes. And Biden believes that he is the best candidate to deliver that message again next year.

Trump’s latest remarks, Lake said, once again raised “the salience [of the issue], and whether [Trump] realizes it or not: America doesn’t want a dictator.”

During the 2020 campaign, there was some idle chatter in Biden’s campaign of making a one-term pledge, becoming a “transitional” president who would rid the nation of Trump and then usher in a new era of Democratic leaders. But those ideas were dismissed even before Biden took the oath of office. And while Biden has never said so explicitly, many people around him believe he might have not sought reelection had Trump been off the playing field. But at this point on the calendar, Biden would almost certainly still run even if Trump suddenly bowed out, according to those close to him.

After Trump’s town hall comment, the Biden campaign flooded social media with warnings and organized an event to bracket the GOP primary debate in Alabama that would include denouncements of the former president.

“Democrats are gonna seize on this … the campaign immediately condemned the comments. The other groups that are working in concert to elect Democrats around the country have amplified this rhetoric as well,” said Weathersby. “These are Trump’s own words. I think you will continue to see more elevation of those words, and making clear that this is the choice — unless something drastic happens in the Republican primary — this person is going to be the Republican nominee.”",political
"On Nov. 17, Silicon Valley tumbled into turmoil when Sam Altman, chief executive of the high-profile A.I. start-up OpenAI, was suddenly removed by the company’s board of directors.

"“This is going to be nationalized in some of these races,” Walz said in an interview with POLITICO Magazine. “But governors have a much better way, and especially good ones, of bringing it back down.”

Like many Democrats, Walz doesn’t think President Joe Biden is getting the credit he deserves on a relatively strong economy, but the campaign can still retool their message as needed.

“They may — I think — rework, refine, this message, but it doesn’t change the fact that Joe Biden invested in the middle class, just like Democratic governors did, and made life more affordable,” Walz said Saturday on the sidelines of the DGA’s winter meeting in Phoenix.

Regardless of what happens in 2024, the party boasts a deep bench going forward, and Walz believes the 2028 Democratic nominee could indeed be a sitting governor.

“I’m biased towards governors,” he said. “But they’re proven.”

We also asked him whether that could even include him.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Elena Schneider: First, congratulations, Mr. Chairman. People often use the DGA chairmanship as a way to build a national fundraising network as they think about running for president, so should we read anything into your move here?

Tim Walz: Well, I’m flattered that you would say so. No, I just believe in the DGA. I want to give back. I’ve seen the effectiveness of it. They helped me in my race. But also, I’m a firm believer now that governors do make a difference. We saw it in Minnesota, we saw it in Michigan, we saw it in Colorado. We see these trifecta states improving folks’ lives, and so this is my way to give back. I believe in the organization. And I’m just honored to do it.

Schneider: But you’re not ruling anything out in the future?

Walz: I have a friend of mine who always said, “Don’t ever turn down a job you’ve never been offered.” So, my job is to focus on this, and to be honest, I’ve got 11 races next year and that is my focus.

Schneider: What are the most important governors’ races next year?

Walz: I think holding those races we have. I tried my hardest to get [Washington Gov.] Jay Inslee to stay again. He could be my governor forever. There, of course, and in North Carolina and Delaware, where we’re term limited with [North Carolina Gov.] Roy Cooper and [Delaware Gov.] John Carney. I think there’s a golden opportunity in New Hampshire [where GOP incumbent Chris Sununu is retiring]. I can tell you those four states are a priority, especially with our incumbent governors being term-limited.

Schneider: You mentioned North Carolina. In Democratic candidate Josh Stein’s launch video, he explicitly tied GOP Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson to former President Donald Trump. How much do you think Trump is going to play a role in governor’s races in 2024?

Walz: They own him. He is going to play a role.

But look, the DGA does something different, and Andy Beshear did this. He didn’t spend a ton of time talking about President Trump. He talked about the things impacting people in their states. I think that’s the difference with governors.

We’re not naive. This is going to be nationalized in some of these races. But governors have a much better way, and especially good ones, of bringing it back down. Andy Beshear did that and he won because of that. He stayed focused on disaster relief, about recovering, caring for people, delivering on that, so they’re going to have to explain why they’re supportive of President Trump, but I think our candidates will be out there saying, “This is the difference it makes. We’re functional, not dysfunctional. We get things done,” and I think that’ll be the message.

Schneider: President Joe Biden didn’t campaign with Beshear in Kentucky. He didn’t show up in Virginia for those state legislative races. What kind of role do you think Biden is going to play?

Walz: I think it will depend on each place. Certainly, governors know this: President Biden has delivered on infrastructure, he’s delivered on the CHIPS Act, he continues to deliver across the board in Minnesota. We’re seeing it every day. Governors can message that, but I think we’ve always said this — each race is unique. There’ll be states where the president will be campaigning with our candidates and others he won’t.

Andy Beshear talked about it this morning, he said, “Look, I’ve disagreed with the president on some things, but I’m 100 percent supportive of him.” We need to message our own races. When you have good candidates in these races, when we get a good candidate out of North Carolina, we’ll run a good race, we will win that governor’s race. There may be some states that our candidates will help the president.

Schneider: Governors like Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan and Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania have job approval ratings that are 10, 15, 20 points better than Joe Biden. Can you explain that gap?

Walz: I think it’s not surprising to see governors do that, because we’re delivering every day. I think the constant drumbeat of dysfunction in D.C. gets attached to the president. But we all run into this. When we’re running against the generic Republican, our races are always really close, but there’s no such thing [as a generic Republican]. These guys are weird. Once they start running, their weirdness shows up, and especially with the nominee on the other side. I don’t think it’s that surprising.

This is going to be a binary choice. Democracy, or what we saw with the former president. Projects, like roads getting built, or dysfunction. Pre-existing conditions being covered by health care, or having that ripped out. Those binary choices will start to become clear. They saw us act, how we acted during Covid, they saw us act on the recovery. It’ll work itself out.

Schneider: As somebody with experience as both a federal candidate and as a statewide candidate, is there any advice you’d give to the president or his team?

Walz: I think it’s hard for him and I think Joe Biden, especially, is a fairly humble guy. We have a saying in Minnesota: “If you do something good and talk about it, it no longer counts.” I think there was a slowness to talk about the things they did.

It’s one of our jobs to get out there and talk about it. I’ve talked to [White House infrastructure czar] Mitch Landrieu and the White House on infrastructure. Look, this is a golden age of infrastructure because of the president. Governors are the ones that are managing that — broadband expansion, removal of lead pipes. Put the signs up. Say where it came from.

I wouldn’t be so bullish on Joe Biden or be so excited about it, if I saw that he wasn’t delivering. I’ve watched him deliver. We, as governors, who lived through what President Trump did not do during Covid, I’m not going back there again. Tell the story. Put some signs up for building bridges. Let us know where the money came from.

Schneider: It’s no secret that people like Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, JB Pritzker, Wes Moore, Phil Murphy are potential presidential contenders one day. In 2028, do you think the Democratic presidential nominee will be a sitting governor?

Walz: Yes, I do. Potentially. Well, I shouldn’t say that. For me, personally, I think it would be a good choice for it to be one of them because I’ve seen them deliver. I’ve seen all these governors have to make hard decisions every day and they have to deliver. They’re executives, they’re counselors, at times, they’re budget managers. I’m biased towards governors, but they’re proven. They’ve done great.

Schneider: In the 2020 primary, though, governors didn’t do great. Is there something different about 2028?

Walz: I think our profiles all changed — and the importance of it — after COVID. I think people understood how important governors were. Even in things like name recognition, things shot up. I think it was delivering on these hard things. All those folks you mentioned, a lot of people already know because of the work they’ve done over the last four years.

Schneider: By most measures, the economy is doing very well right now. And at the same time, people don’t feel it — at least they don’t say they feel it, even as Biden has tried to talk about Bidenomics as a vehicle to sell it. What do you see as the messaging disconnect?

Walz: The most powerful message from Joe Biden is this economy needs to be built from the bottom up, the middle out: investing in things like infrastructure, investing in affordability of college, investing in childcare, housing, those are all things governors did with the help of the president.

We just came back from a trade mission in Australia, and every other country in the world would give just about anything to have our economy — 5 percent growth in the third quarter, unemployment rates, things like that. The pandemic, broken supply chains and everything — we did see inflation. Now, we’re taming inflation, we’re bringing it down, but we don’t have deflation. So some of those prices that went up didn’t come back down, but we’re paying $2.89 a gallon for gas in Minnesota again. Things are starting to stabilize. I think by next November, there’ll start to be more of a realization on that.

Schneider: Do you think Biden and his team need to rethink how they’re talking about the economy?

Walz: Maybe. I think it’ll evolve. Every campaign changes as things go. I do think you’re going to start to see it sink in that people are moving in the other direction. For the first time, we saw consumer confidence up in November. I think the holiday season will make a difference. If we see a rate reduction [at the Federal Reserve], I think that’ll make a difference. But we’ve got a year.

Schneider: Less than a year.

Walz: I think they can retool their message. I think the acknowledgement is that people are paying higher for some things because of inflationary pressures, but we also need to talk about how real wages are up.

Who do they blame? You know the sitting president gets blamed for some of those things. So they may — I think — rework, refine, this message, but it doesn’t change the fact that Joe Biden invested in the middle class, just like Democratic governors did, and made life more affordable after some of the most challenging times that we’ve ever seen.

Schneider: Abortion is a hugely important issue in governors’ races. But Biden isn’t comfortable talking about it. Do you worry about a mismatch in the messenger with arguably the most important issue Democrats are running on?

Walz: No. His actions show that he is supportive of those rights. Look, this was never an easy issue for anybody. But this does contrast, once again, this idea of freedom versus their extreme policies on this, and they continue to grab that rail. They can’t let it go. And I think the president, you know, he’s, probably, personally torn. But all of his policies are right in line with that. People know that. And the big thing is that they see what the contrast is. I can’t say that enough about this binary choice that’s coming. It’s still not a binary choice. It’ll be a binary choice after February. And you’ll start to see that, so no, I don’t worry about that.

Schneider: You’ve managed to pass an enormous number of Democratic policy priorities, even with a narrow majority in your legislature. Do you have any advice for your former colleagues in Congress about how to do it?

Walz: Be bold. A one-vote majority is a majority. But here’s the thing: We pass things that are popular. They want to make the case — okay, go ahead and try, turn back reproductive rights, go ahead and try. Turn back paid family medical leave, go ahead and try. Turn back some of these initiatives we made around climate. These things are popular. This is the time to be bold.",political
"Ahead of Black Friday last month, I drew attention to a series of record-setting Amazon deals on three of the best cheap phones in 2023: the Samsung Galaxy A54, iPhone 13 and Google Pixel 7a. Black Friday itself is now over, but there’s good news for anyone still in the market for an affordable smartphone upgrade this holiday season – all three of those aforementioned cheap phone deals remain active in one guise or another.

The Galaxy A54, for instance, is still on sale at Amazon in both the US and UK, albeit for a slightly higher price than we saw over Black Friday weekend. Right now, you can pick up Samsung’s mid-range champ for $349.99 (down from $449.99), or £282.50 (down from £399) – that’s only $25 / £7 more than last week’s record-low Galaxy A54 price, and still a sizeable $100 / £116 saving.

Amazon continues to offer the iPhone 13 for a record-low £549 (down from $599) in the UK, too, and although the retailer no longer sells device-only iPhone models in the US, you can pick up a professionally refurbished model for only $474 (down from $497). If you’d rather spend a little more on a box-fresh model, Apple itself is still selling the iPhone 13 as new for a very reasonable $599 (down from $699).

The news is less brilliant for prospective Google Pixel 7a shoppers in the US, as Amazon’s record-low deal is no longer active, but the retailer’s lowest-ever Google Pixel 7a deal is still live in the UK (at £379 down from £449). If you're in the US and willing to spend a little more, the newer Google Pixel 8 is currently available for $549 (down from $699).

Naturally, none of these (relatively) affordable phones can rival their newer siblings for power, but all three remain more-than-capable handsets thanks to their still-powerful chipsets, impressive displays and decent cameras. What’s more, they’ll be supported with software and security updates for at least the next three years (if you go for the Samsung, you’ll get four years of support, and if you go for the iPhone, you’ll get five).

Today's best cheap phone deals

Samsung Galaxy A54 5G

US: was $449.99 now $349.99 at Amazon

UK: was £399 now £282.50 at Amazon

The cornerstone of Samsung's 2023 Galaxy A-series phones boasts a crisp 6.4-inch AMOLED display, three capable cameras – a 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide and 10MP front-facing – and enviable longevity. It's a truly solid phone that continues to be available for an excellent price at Amazon (in both the US and UK).

iPhone 13

US: was $699 now $599 at Apple

UK: was £599 now £549 at Amazon

The iPhone 13 was already reduced by $100 / £100 following the release of the iPhone 14 last year, but now that the iPhone 15 is out, it's even better value. If you're simply looking for a capable iPhone at a cut price, then this is the model to go for – it's pretty much the same phone as the iPhone 14, but cheaper. Their designs are identical, their cameras are (almost) identical and their chipsets are separated by just one generation – which, in Apple terms, means next to nothing.

Google Pixel 7a

US: $484.99 at Amazon

UK: was £449 now £379 at Amazon

The Pixel 7a is no longer on sale in the US, but Amazon continues to offer the phone for a record-low £379 in the UK. With Google's Tensor G2 chip, a 6.1-inch FHD+ OLED display, dual rear cameras featuring a 64MP wide lens, and great AI features such as Photo Unblur, the Pixel 7a provides an exceptional mobile experience without straining your wallet.

There is absolutely a strategy

to draft your fantasy football team specifically

with each of the positions.

If you listen to me and you pay attention

throughout the year, you'll have a shot at the title,

by the end.

[Host] Roughly 40 million people play fantasy football

and Matthew Barry is the absolute expert.

So my name is Matthew Barry

and my official title is Senior Fantasy

and Sports Betting Analyst for NBC Sports and Peacock.

I'm often referred to the Godfather of Fantasy Football.

[Host] Matthew Berry is gonna

take us position by position,

highlighting what stats make a successful fantasy option.

[upbeat music]

When it comes to quarterbacks in general,

what you want is dual threat quarterbacks.

Quarterbacks that not only get you fantasy points

with their arm, but with their legs.

Last season of the top six quarterbacks

in fantasy points per game, four of them

had 700 or more rushing yards and in fact,

eight of the top 10 fantasy quarterbacks

in points per game last year had at least 350 yards.

You really want a dual threat quarterback because

if they don't get you fantasy points with their legs

you need them to have 40 passing touchdown upside

and there just aren't a lot of quarterbacks

like that in the NFL right now.

I also think it's important to understand tiers,

Josh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, and Jalen Hurts

are kind of the elite top three,

but there's a clear top eight quarterbacks.

What you really want is quarterbacks that run

and throw that have talents around them.

You can be the best quarterback in the world,

but if you've got the worst offensive line,

it's hard to throw from your back.

Josh Allen's a great example.

Josh Allen had a bad completion percentage.

They said he was more of a runner than a thrower.

Year three, Josh Allen gets Stefon Diggs,

one of the best wide receivers in the NFL.

What happens, he becomes the number one quarterback

in fantasy, everyone talks about his accuracy

and elite passing.

Did Josh suddenly become a better quarterback?

Yes he did.

Having Stefon Diggs to throw to,

makes you a better quarterback.

[upbeat music]

For the running back position,

volume is key, the top five running backs

in fantasy points per game last season

all had at least 310 touches,

16 of the top 20 had at least 250 touches, all finished

as top 20 running backs in fantasy points per game.

The next thing is what kind of touches are they getting?

Specifically, we want to look for high value touches,

receptions and red zone touches.

Are they getting the ball when the team gets

inside their opponent's 20 yard line, that's the red zone.

Are they getting it in goal to go situations

which is inside and opponent's 10 yards?

So ideally you want running backs that touch the ball a lot

and that they touch the ball a lot when they get close

to the goal line and they touch the ball a lot

from their quarterback, not just on first and second down

but also on third down as part of the pass attack.

[upbeat music]

In terms of wide receiver,

that's somebody that is earning a high percentage

of targets, target share and targets for routes run.

Wide receivers need to have the ability to earn targets

by getting open.

The actual best wide receivers in the NFL

tend to be the ones who score the most fantasy points.

Justin Jefferson, Jamar Chase, Cooper Kupp,

Tyreek kill, Stefon Diggs,

those guys are the best wide receivers

in the NFL and they also are the ones who score

the most fantasy points.

If you want some efficiency metrics,

if you want to get a little bit dirty, target share,

targets per route run, yards per route run are all good

efficiency metrics for wide receivers,

wide receivers tend to be safer early round picks

due to consistency and lower injury risk.

When you think about it,

running backs are being tackled hard.

They're going in between the pile,

wide receivers they bounce out of bounds, they're being hit

by a defensive back, not a defensive lineman.

Wide receivers tend to have a lower injury risk.

I also like rookies by the way,

look at the second half rookie wide receivers,

there's a number of talented wide receivers,

they might starts slow as rookies, but over the second half

of the year will have a huge impact.

You think about last year with guys

like Garrett Wilson, Chris Olave, Jahan Dotson at times

that's another place to look

for as you get further into the season.

[upbeat music]

And then at the tight end position,

what you want is you want see how many snaps.

are they out on a passing flight?

Are they used primarily as a blocker?

Are they used as a passer?

Sometimes they're really just glorified wide receivers.

What's their opportunity?

We can look at talent, if they have a good quarterback.

Is the tight end used more as a blocker in this offense

or is the tight end used as a passing weapon in the offense?

Generally speaking, I either want to be one

of the first people in my league to get a tight end

or one of the last,

because having an elite tight end can be a huge advantage.

Travis Kelce, Mark Andrews TJ Hockenson,

for me are those top three.

I think they stand up above the rest.

[upbeat music]

We've spent a lot of time looking at trying to predict

kickers scoring and kicker scoring year over year over year

and generally speaking

the best kicker in fantasy football

and like the 12th kicker in fantasy football,

the difference is like one and a half points a game.

There's just not much difference.

There's a lot of variance.

You like kickers on good offenses, you like kickers

that play indoors in warm weather cities

so they're not often kicking in bad weather.

You can look at defenses that give up the most field goals

that have good red zone defense

but bad defense in the middle of the field,

kind of the bend don't break defenses,

their teams will come down

and they often will kick potentially speaking,

it doesn't make sense to draft a kicker

before the last round.

[upbeat music]

With defenses, you can predict something.

You can predict, hey, this is a team that likes

to blitz a lot.

So probably they'll generate some sacks

maybe a few more turnovers.

But honestly it's generally fairly flukey.

If you look at defensive scoring year after year

it rarely carries forward from season to season.

So streaming is always a a much better option than saying

I'm gonna go out to target this.

There are defenses that we think are gonna be pretty good,

the Eagles and the Niners,

but you're often better off of just picking

the defense that's playing inept offense week after week.

[Host] Now that You have your team built,

let's get to the most important part.

A fantasy team name is very important,

this is not a decision to take lightly.

The team name should reflect your personality

and ideally insult somebody else in your league.

Fantasy football, there is no one right way to play.

There is no one right way to draft.

Ultimately, you have to figure out what works

for you and do what you want to do.

"By comparison, the U.S. has had to contend most recently with a rate of 3.2 percent in October, and there is some economic consensus that the worst is over. But polls suggest the political damage has already been done. A majority of Americans rate the economy as poor; three in four voters think the economy is in recession. The Republican talking points write themselves — as the Wall Street Journal pointed out, inflation hit a 39-year high by the end of Biden’s first year in office. The inflation that has marred Biden’s presidency is the most economically and politically destructive since the Carter years.

This was the issue where Milei shined. Using flamboyant rhetoric and actions, he made his priority clear. He promised not just to reduce inflation, but rather to “exterminate” it. He even went so far as to destroy a piñata representing the central bank on live television. He proposes a solution from the more primordial days of the American republic: abolishing the national bank altogether, and simply using the U.S. dollar.

Though widely accepted around the globe, only a smattering of small countries besides America use the U.S. dollar officially, while such beleaguered economies as Iraq and Lebanon lean heavily in that direction unofficially. No economy as large and ostensibly legitimate as Argentina has taken such a radical step.

But Milei doesn’t care — and neither did a majority of voters.

“Central banks are divided in categories,” he said in August. “The bad ones, like the Federal Reserve, the very bad ones, like the ones in Latin America, the horribly bad ones, and the Central Bank of Argentina.”

Milei’s policy prescriptions don’t have much relevance in a U.S. context. A self-described “anarcho-capitalist,” he represents a ferocious counterpoint to the ideology known as Peronism. Originally named for 1950s-era President Juan Peron (and his international sex symbol wife Eva), it has been the default ideology in Buenos Aires since World War II — somewhere to the left of U.S. Democratic orthodoxy, but to the right of Bernie Sanders-style socialism.

The political lessons are a different story. Milei’s election is a reminder of several universal truths that should worry Biden: In inflationary times, the public’s appetite for ideas and rhetoric once deemed beyond the pale is heightened — and defending the economic status quo can prove politically fatal.

Milei’s election is a reminder of several universal truths that should worry Biden. | Andrew Harnik/AP

The success of Milei’s relentless central bank-bashing should serve notice of the potential appeal of Donald Trump’s own populist offensive against the Federal Reserve. As president, Trump frequently and evocatively attacked the “boneheads” of the Fed, and its chair, Jerome Powell. He publicly questioned whether Powell or China was a greater enemy to the U.S. More recently, he has suggested he will pressure Powell to lower interest rates.

Indeed, the parallels with Trump, who counts himself among Milei’s fans, are what makes the architecture of Milei’s triumph worth studying. The Trump-like media circus surrounding Milei, with his late-era Elvis sideburns, bombast and playboy image, had the effect of sanding down or obscuring the sharp edges, a testament to the power of a sideshow. Biden’s overcome it once before, but that was before three-quarters of Americans believed the U.S. economy is in recession.

Those Democrats who are marrow-deep with certainty that the party will summit to victory next autumn on the issue of abortion may also find the Argentine example unsettling.

The country bucked consensus in the region by providing broad rights to the procedure in the quiet days at the end of 2020. Support for abortion in Argentina, then, appeared wide-ranging.

Yet Argentines elected a quite socially conservative executive. (Even the pope — an Argentine — isn’t conservative enough for him; echoing complaints from the Catholic right, Milei has called the pontiff a “filthy leftist.”) Yet Milei was able to blow through the abortion trench lines by force of personality and style.

He contends that human life begins at conception and says that the country that just voted to legalize the procedure must now have a new “discussion” on its future. And, most doctrinally, that “the only way I support the right to abortion is at risk to the mother’s life, because there is a property conflict.” In libertarian layman’s terms, for Milei, the risk to the mother’s life is the only instance in which the rights of the mother supersede the rights of the unborn, as there is a direct conflict between the mother’s life and the fetus — or quite plausibly both could be lost.

One explanation is that Milei’s personal style and libertine ways were successful as a misdirection play on the abortion issue. Perhaps Milei’s anti-abortion supporters believe he means it; and his abortion-rights supporters console themselves this is mere politics. In that sense, he became a human Rorschach test: If you were fed up and wanted to vote for him, you found a reason to.

It’s a strain of voting behavior that we’ve seen in American elections before. As libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) remarked in 2017 on why Trump won: “They were voting for the craziest son of a bitch in the race.” The policy details were a mere side dish.

The timing of Milei’s ascent is also of note. On the heels of Trump’s 2020 defeat, Trumpist mime Jair Bolsonaro also went down in a narrow defeat last autumn in neighboring Brazil — a South American result that presaged Democrats’ unexpected overperformance in the 2022 midterms.

Bolsonaro receded from the arena, even sojourning silently in Florida for a time. But not before the maniacal wing of his constituency attacked government buildings in Brasilia, in copycat frustration mirroring America’s Jan. 6 riots. Mexico votes next Spring, and the U.S. votes in a year: Could the leftward drift, sometimes called “the pink tide,” of the Americas be over?

Like Bolsonaro and Trump, Milei had primed his followers in the run-up to the election with claims of election fraud. If he hadn’t won the Nov. 19 run-off, he likely would have claimed shadowy subterfuge, directly borrowing from the Trump playbook.

“The irregularities were so big that it puts the results in doubt,” said Milei about his underperformance in the election’s first round. In a subsequent court filing, his campaign said there had been “colossal fraud.”

Milei won in the final round anyway. Whether by design or effect, the election fraud claims may have served as a voter turnout tool in Argentina — energized Milei supporters took to the streets to protest several times in the days leading to the run-off. It’s no longer hard to envision such an endgame on American soil.",political
"The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) remake is still in production. However, given that we've not seen anything new about the game since the mysterious teaser was revealed back in 2021, it seems unlikely that the RPG will be ready anytime soon.

Coming courtesy of Saber Interactive and Lucasfilm Games, the KOTOR remake is intended to offer a revamped and modernized version of the original, which was first released in 2003. Regarded as one of the best RPGs ever made by fans, BioWare's original sci-fi adventure paved the way for modern, player-driven, and narratively rich titles like Mass Effect and Baldur's Gate 3. The RPG's sparkling writing, memorable companions, and surprisingly nuanced takes on the Light Side and the Dark Side of the Star Wars universe gave fans a lot to think about.

Set thousands of years before the movies, KOTOR follows the story of a mysterious force user who finds themself stuck between the Galactic Republic and the Sith armada of the malevolent Darth Malak. Though undoubtedly gripping, KOTOR's aged graphics do make playing it a hard sell in the 2020s. Fortunately, this remake intends to give the game a facelift without changing any of the fundamental aspects of the plot - the opposite of the likes of Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Resident Evil 4 which both famously made changes to the original material. Read on to find out everything we know about this much-anticipated upcoming game.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake: cut to the chase

What is it? A remake of the classic Star Wars RPG

A remake of the classic Star Wars RPG When is it coming out? TBC

TBC What can I play it on? PC and PS5 (as a timed console exclusive)

(Image credit: Aspyr)

A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake release date hasn’t been confirmed yet. Given the lack of material available for the game from official sources, we don’t expect to get another look at this Star Wars RPG any time soon. The first developer Aspyr confirmed that the game was still in early development before its parent company Saber Interactive took over, so it seems unlikely to launch for a few more years at least.

However, we do The KOTOR remake will launch on PC and as a timed console exclusive on PS5. That means it will likely come to Xbox Series X|S after a short while, though an Xbox release date or window hasn’t been confirmed yet.

Knights of the Old Republic remake trailer

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was officially announced at the PlayStation Showcase 2021, with a brief teaser trailer. The trailer, seen below, has the voice of Bastilla Shan, one of the recruitable characters in the original title, and shows off a pivotal villain from the story: Darth Revan.

In a strange turn of events, the trailer has since been de-listed from the official PlayStation YouTube channel, though it remains accessible on other channels. It's unknown as to whether or not this is a reflection of development trouble or simply a quirk of Sony's media department.

We haven't seen any more trailers since this first look, but if you want to keep your eye out for more, then check out PlayStation's official Youtube channel.

Knights of the Old Republic remake story and setting

(Image credit: Aspyr)

Set over 4,000 years before the events of the original Star Wars trilogy; the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake has you play as a Jedi fighting against the evil forces of Darth Malak, who has set out to destroy the Galactic Republic.

Unlike the Star Wars films where the Sith are skittering about in the shadows, the Sith of the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake have an empire of their own and are a force to be reckoned with.

It’s hard to overestimate just how big of a deal this game was upon its original release. The BioWare original game offered unparalleled choice when directing your characters’ story and personality. The player was able to make numerous decisions throughout the game that would affect the trajectory of the narrative, an innovation that would go on to influence Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and a host of other RPGs down the line. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic was an impressively open take on the Star Wars universe, released during a time when the franchise still felt like it had mysterious uncharted corners of lore to explore.

Knights of the Old Republic remake gameplay

(Image credit: Aspyr)

The original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic title was an RPG that saw players travel to different planets and choose various plot decisions that would slowly progress the narrative and allow you to collect either Light Side or Dark Side points. These points would eventually determine whether your character walked the path of the Dark Side or the Light Side, while also allowing access to certain powers.

Combat was a hybrid of traditional 'computer role-playing game' (CRPG} mechanics and more modern action-oriented offerings. Combat could be paused mid-flow to give you time to think, but the engagements themselves would play out in real-time.

We haven't seen any footage for the remake yet, but players can expect it to stay largely similar to the original. “We’re rebuilding one of the greatest RPGs of all time for a new generation"", Aspyr’s Lead Producer, Ryan Treadwell, said in a PlayStation Blog post, ""while maintaining the integrity of the story and characters that we’ve come to cherish"".

Knights of the Old Republic remake news

KOTOR Trailer delisted from Sony's YouTube channel

The announcement trailer for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic has been taken down from Sony's official YouTube channel. Saber Interactive and its parent company, Embracer Group have both reportedly declined to comment on this move (via TheGamer), stoking fears that the game may be stuck in development limbo.



KOTOR Remake is still in development

The Embracer Group revealed a quarterly report for Q4 (FY 2022-2023), which lists all games currently in active development (via TheGamer). KOTOR Remake was listed in the report, meaning that the game is indeed still being worked on in some capacity.

Who is making the Knights of the Old Republic Remake?

After what seemed like an indefinite pause in development under Aspyr, the parent organization Embracer Group has confirmed that Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake will be under new management. Embracer wrote in a blog post that the change was made to “ensure the quality bar is where we need it to be for the title.”

The responsibility has now passed up the chain to Aspyr's parent company Saber Interactive to complete the development of the RPG. Saber Interactive was already reportedly overseeing the production of KOTOR Remake, so this switch hopefully means that we won't see a massive change in direction for this anticipated sci-fi title.

"Today, I’m talking with Jerry Chow. He’s the director of quantum systems at IBM, meaning he’s trying to build the future one qubit at a time.

IBM made some announcements this week about its plans for the next 10 years of quantum computing: there are new chips, new computers, and new APIs. You’ll hear us get into more of the details as we go, but the important thing to know upfront is that quantum computers could have theoretically incredible amounts of processing power and could entirely revolutionize the way we think of computers… if, that is, someone can build one that’s actually useful.

Here’s Jerry, explaining the basics of what a quantum computer is:

A quantum computer is basically a fundamentally different way of computing. It relies on the laws of quantum mechanics, but it just changes how information is handled. So instead of using bits, we have quantum bits or qubits.

A regular computer — the quantum folks call them “classical computers” — like an iPhone or a laptop or even a fancy Nvidia GPU works by encoding data in bits. Bits basically have two states, which we call zero and one. They’re on or they’re off.

But the laws of quantum mechanics that Jerry just mentioned mean that qubits behave very, very differently. They can be zero or one, but they might also be a whole lot of things in between.

You still have two states: a zero and a one. But they can also be in superpositions of zero and one, which means that there’s a probability that when you measure it, it will be zero or one with particular probability. In terms of how we physically build these, they’re not switches anymore, they’re not transistors, but they’re actually elements that have quantum mechanical behavior.

One of my favorite things about all this is that in order to make these new quantum computers work, you have to cool them to within fractions of a degree of absolute zero, which means a lot of companies have had to work very hard on cryogenic cooling systems just so other people could work on quantum chips. Jerry calls early quantum computers “science projects,” but his goal is to engineer actual products people can use.

You’ll hear Jerry talk about making a useful quantum computer in terms of “utility,” which is when quantum computers start to push against the limits of what regular computers can simulate. IBM has been chasing after utility for a while now. It first made quantum computers available on the cloud in 2016, it’s shipped System One quantum computers to partners around the world, and now, this week, it’s announcing System Two along with a roadmap for the future. It’s Decoder, so I asked Jerry exactly how he and his team sit down and build a roadmap for the next 10 years of applied research in a field that requires major breakthroughs at every level of the product. Oh, and we talked about Ant-Man.

It’s a fun one — very few people sit at the bleeding edge all day like Jerry.

Okay. Jerry Chow, director of quantum systems at IBM. Here we go.

This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Jerry Chow, you are an IBM fellow and director of quantum systems. Welcome to Decoder.

Glad to be here.

I’m really excited to talk to you. There’s quite a lot to talk about — quantum computing in general, where it is. But you’ve got some news to announce today, so I want to make sure we talk about the news right off the bat. What is going on in IBM Quantum?

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

Yeah, so we have our annual Quantum Summit coming up, where we basically invite our network of members and users to come, and we talk about some of the really exciting news. What we’re announcing this year is actually we have a really exciting upgraded quantum processor that we’re talking about. It’s called the IBM Quantum Heron. It has 133 qubits. It’s the highest performance processor that we’ve ever built, and it’s going to be available for users to access via our cloud services.

We’re also launching IBM Quantum System Two and introducing this as a new architecture for scaling our quantum computers into the future. We’re also talking about a 10-year roadmap looking ahead. We, at IBM Quantum, like to sort of call our shots, tell everyone what we’re doing because that keeps us honest, keeps everyone in the industry on the same benchmark of seeing what progress is. And we’re expanding that roadmap, which we actually first introduced a couple of years ago and have hit all our milestones thus far. But we are extending it out to 2033, pushing forward into this next realm where we really want to drive toward pushing quantum computing at scale.

So you’ve got a new processor, you’ve got a new computing architecture in System Two, you’ve got a longer roadmap. Put that in context for me: we’ve been hearing about quantum computing for quite a long time. I have stared at a number of quantum computers and been told, “This is the coldest piece of the universe that has ever existed.” It’s been very entertaining, at the very least. We’re only now at the point where we’re actually solving real problems with quantum computers.

We’re not even at the point of solving real problems.

Not even yet?

Not yet. But we are, really excitingly, just this past year, at the point where we’re calling this utility-scale quantum computing. We’re using 100-plus qubits. We used a processor earlier in the year called Eagle, where we were able to look at a particular problem that you couldn’t really solve with brute-force methods using a classical computer, but also it challenged the best classical approximation methods that are used on high-performance computing. So what’s interesting there is that now the quantum computer becomes like the benchmark. You almost need it to verify whether your approximate classical methods are working properly. And that just happens when you go over 100 qubits.

At 100 qubits, things all change so that you just can’t use, say, GPUs or any kind of classical computers to simulate what’s going on accurately. This is why we’re in this phase where we call it utility scale because there’s going to be this back and forth between using a quantum as a tool compared with what you can still potentially do in classical. But then there’s a long road there that we’re going to try to drive value using the quantum to get toward quantum manage.

I think the word utility there threw me off. This is the branch point where the problems you solve with a quantum computer start to become meaningfully different than the problems you could solve with a regular computer.

That’s right. We see this really as an inflection point. There are a lot of industries that use high-performance computation already, and they are looking at very, very hard problems that use the Oak Ridge supercomputers and whatnot. And now quantum becomes an additional tool that opens up a new lens for them to look at a different area of compute space that they weren’t able to look at before.

So IBM has a huge program in quantum. The other big companies do, too — Microsoft, Google, what have you, they’re all investing in this space. Does this feel like a classical capitalist competition, “We’re all racing forward to get the first product to market”? Is it a bunch of researchers who know that there’s probably a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, but we’re nowhere close to it yet, so we’re all kind of friendly? What’s the vibe?

I’d say that it’s a very exciting time to be in this field. How often do you get to say you’re building from the ground floor of a completely new computational architecture? Something that is just fundamentally different from traditional classical computing. And so yeah, I’d say that there’s certainly a lot of groundswell, there’s a lot of buzz. Sometimes a little too much buzz, maybe. But also I think from the perspective of competition, it helps drive the industry forward.

We, at IBM, have been at the forefront of computation for decades. And so it’s in our blood. The ideas of roadmaps and pushing the next big development, the next big innovations in computation, have always been something that is just native to IBM, and quantum is no different. We’ve been in the game with quantum since the early theoretical foundings for probably 30 years, 30-plus years. But now we’re really starting to bear a lot of that fruit in terms of building the architectures, building the systems, putting out the hardware, developing the framework for how to make it usable and accessible.

Let me give you just a much dumber comparison. We had the CEO of AWS on the show, Adam Selipsky. AWS is furiously competitive with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. They are trying to take market share from each other, and they do a lot of innovative things to make better products, but the end goal of that is taking one customer away from Google. You’re not there yet, right? There’s not market share to be moved around yet?

Certainly not at that scale.

But are there quantum customers that you compete for?

There’s certainly a growing quantum community.

[Laughs] It’s not a customer; there are people who are interested.

“At 100 qubits, things all change”

There are people that are interested across the board, from developers, to students, to Fortune 500 companies. We have a lot of interest. So just as an example, we first put systems on the cloud in 2016. We put a very simple five-qubit computer, five-qubit quantum computer, on the cloud. But it reflected a real fundamental shift in how quantum could be approached. Before, you had to be sort of a physicist. You had to be in a laboratory turning knobs. You’re taking data, you’re running physicist code; you’re not programming a computer.

Wow. [Laughs] Shout out to physicists.

Well, I’m a physicist, and you don’t want to see my code. [Laughs] But the whole point is that we developed a whole framework around it to actually deploy it and to make it programmable. And think about the early days of computers and all the infrastructure you needed to build in terms of the right assembly language and compilers and the application layers all above that. We’ve been building that for the last seven years since that first launched. And in that time, we’ve had over 500,000 users of our platform and of our services.

I’m always curious how things are structured and how decisions are made. That’s really what we talk about on the show. And there’s a forcing function that comes when it’s a business, and there’s a growth path. Quantum seems very much like one day it will be a huge business because it will solve problems that regular computers can’t. But right now, it’s on the very early part of the curve where you’re investing a lot into R&D, on an aggressive roadmap, but you’re nowhere close to the business yet.

I would say that we’re knocking on the door of business value and looking for that business value, because especially when we’re in this realm where we know that it can be used as a tool pitted against the best classical computers, there’s something there to be explored. A lot of times, even with traditional computers, there are very few proven algorithms that are where we drive all the value. A lot of the value that gets driven is done through heuristics, through just trial and error, through having the tool and using it on a particular problem. That’s why we see this fundamental game-changer of this inflection point going toward utility scale systems of over 100 qubits as now this is the tool that we want users to actually go and find business advantage, find the problems that map appropriately onto these systems for exploration.

So put that in the context of IBM. IBM’s a huge company, it’s over 100 years old, it does a lot of things. This is probably the most cutting-edge thing IBM is doing, I imagine. I’m guessing you’re not going to disagree with me. But it feels like the most cutting-edge thing that most of the Big Tech companies are doing.

Yes, absolutely.

How is that structured inside of IBM? How does that work?

So we’re IBM Quantum within IBM Research. IBM Research has always been the organic growth engine for all of IBM. It’s where a lot of the innovative ideas come in, but overall, a particular strategy within IBM and IBM Research is that we’re not just doing research and then we’re going to do development and then it’s going to go on this very linearized product journey. It’s all integrated together as we are moving forward. And so therefore, we have the opportunity within IBM Quantum that we’re developing products, we’re putting it on the cloud, we’re integrating with IBM Cloud. We’re actually pushing these things forward to build that user base, build that groundswell, before all the various different technology elements are finished. That’s sort of this agile methodology of building this from the ground up, but also getting it out early and often to drive excitement and to really build up the other parts of the ecosystem.

So how is IBM Quantum structured? How many people is it? How is it organized?

So we don’t speak explicit numbers, but we have several hundred people. And then we have parts of the team which are focused on the actual hardware elements, all the way down to the actual quantum processor and the system around it in terms of making those processors function by cooling it down in the cryogenic system, talking to it with control electronics, talking to it with classical computing. So it all needs to tie together.

Then you have software development teams. We also have a cloud and services team that helps to deliver our offerings as a service. And then we have applications teams looking at the next algorithms, the next novel ways of making use of our quantum services. We also have teams that are more outward-looking for business development — trying to drive adoption, working with various clients to engage in the problems of their interests. We also have a part of our team which runs an offering called the Quantum Accelerator. It’s like a consulting arm, working with the clients to get quantum-ready, start understanding how their problems can be impacted by quantum computing and start using our systems.

Is that all flat? Every one of those teams reports to you, or is there structure in between?

No, so all those different ones report to our vice president of quantum computing, which is Jay Gambetta. I take care of the systems part. Basically, the wrapping of the processor and how it runs, executing problems for the users, that’s the piece that I own.

There’s a tension there. It sounds like IBM is designed to attack this tension head-on, which is: “We’re doing a bunch of pure research in cryogenics to make sure that quantum computing can run because it has to be really cold to run.” Then there’s a business development team that’s just off and running, doing sales stuff, and at some point they’re going to come back and say, “We sold this thing.” And the cryogenics team is going to say, “Not yet.” Every business has a problem like that. When you’re in pure research mode, the “not yet” is a real problem.

Oh, yeah.

How often do you run into that?

We have a very good strategy across the team. We know our core services and what the core product we have is. And also we have a roadmap. The concept of the roadmap is both great for the R&D side but also great for the client perspective, business development angle view of seeing what’s coming next. From the internal side, we know we’ve got to continue to drive toward this, and these are our deliverables and these are the new innovations that we need to do. In fact, in our new roadmap that we’re releasing, we have that separated. Both a development roadmap, which is more product focused and more like what the end user’s going to get and client’s going to get. And we have an innovation roadmap to show those things which we’re still going to need to turn to crank and figure out what feeds in.

I often say the roadmap is our mantra, and it really is our calling card both internally and externally. Not many people really show a lot of detail in their roadmap, but it serves as a guiding tool for us all.

I was looking at that roadmap, and it is very aggressive. We’re at Heron, there are many birds to come from what I understand. And the goal is that a truly functional quantum computer needs thousands or millions of qubits, right?

We have a transition toward what we are calling quantum at scale, which I think what you’re referring to is when you will get to the point where you can run quantum error correction, correct for all the errors that are underlying within these qubits, which are noisy. People throw around that number — millions of qubits — in a way that almost drives fear into the hearts of people. One actually really exciting thing that we’ve done this past year is we’ve developed a set of novel error correction codes that brings down that resource count a lot.

So actually, you’ll need potentially hundreds of thousands of qubits, 100,000 qubits or so, to build a fault-tolerant quantum error-correction-based quantum computer of a particular size to do some of those problems that we’re talking about at scale. And that’s part of the roadmap, too. So that’s what we’re looking at further to the Blue Jay system in 2033. So there’s certainly a number of birds to get there, but we have concrete ideas for the technological hurdles to overcome to get there.

That’s the goal. You’re going to get to some massively larger scale than you are today. Orders of magnitude. Today the chip has 133 qubits, you need to get to thousands. Some people, terrifyingly, are saying millions.

Part of your strategy is linking the chips together into these more modular systems and then putting control circuitry around them. I’m a person who came up in what you might call the classical computing environment, that’s very familiar. That’s a very familiar strategy; we’re just going to do more cores. That’s what that looks like to me. Lots of companies have run up against a lot of problems here. In that part of the world, there’s just Moore’s law, and we sit around talking about it all day long. And Nvidia and maybe TSMC have gotten over it this time, and Intel has struggled to get the next process node and increase the transistor density. Is there an equivalent to Moore’s law in quantum that you were thinking about?

Our roadmap is showing that type of progression.

I look at that roadmap, and you are definitely assuming a number of breakthroughs along the way — in a way that Intel just assumed it for years and years and they achieved it, and then kind of hit the end of the road.

Even where we are today with Heron, and actually complementary to Heron this year, we also already built a 1,000-qubit processor, Condor. Its explicit goal was to push the limits of how many qubits could we put on a single chip, push the limits of how much architecture could we put in an entire system. How much could we actually cool down in the dilution refrigerators that we know today, the cryogenic refrigerators that we have today? Push the boundaries of everything to understand where things break. And if you look at the early part of our roadmap, the birds are there with various technological hurdles that we’ve already overcome to get toward this thousand-qubit level. And now those next birds that you see in the rest of the innovation roadmap are different types of couplers, different types of technologies, that are those technological hurdles, like in semiconductors, that allow us to bridge the gap.

Are they the same? Is it the same kind of, “We need to double transistor density,” or is it a different set of challenges?

“I’d say, the decades of experience matter”

They’re different, because with this sort of modular approach, there’s some that are like, how many can we place into a single chip? How many can we place into a single package? How many can we package together within the system? So they all require slightly different technological innovations within the whole value chain. But we don’t see them as not doable; we see them certainly as things that we will handle over the next few years. We’re already starting to test linking between two packages via a cryogenic cable. This is toward our Flamingo demonstration, which we’re planning for next year.

Do you get to leverage any of the things that are happening on the process side with classical computers?

Oh, yeah.

Like TSMC hits three nanometers and you get to pull that forward, or is that different?

Not so explicitly to the newest stuff that’s happening today in semiconductors. But IBM has been in the semiconductors game for many, many decades. And a lot of the work that we’ve achieved with even achieving a 100 qubits with Eagle a couple of years ago was because we had that deep-rooted semiconductor background. So just to give you an example, at 100 qubits, the challenge is how do you actually wire to 100 qubits in a chip? The standard thing you do in semiconductors is you go to more layers, but it’s not so easy to do that just in these superconducting quantum circuits because they might mess up the qubits. It might cause them to decohere.

But because of our know-how with packaging, we found the right materials, we found the right way of using our fabrication techniques to implement that type of multilayer wiring and still talk to these 100 qubits. We evolved that further this past year to actually get to 1,000. And so that type of semiconductor know-how is just ingrained and something that is, I’d say, the decades of experience matter.

So you’re going to build the next-generation quantum computing chip, Heron. It’s got 133 qubits. How is that chip manufactured?

Okay. Well, to build the next-generation quantum computing chip, we rely on advanced packaging techniques that involve multiple layers of superconducting metal to package and to wire up various superconducting qubits. With Heron, we’re also using a novel tunable coupler architecture, which allows us to have world-record performing two-qubit gate qualities. And all this is done in a standard fabrication facility that we have at IBM and package up this chip, and we have to cool it down into a cryogenic environment.

So silicon goes in one side of the building, Heron comes out the other?

I mean, certainly more steps than that. [Laughs] And there’s this know-how of how to do it properly to have high-performing qubits, which we’ve just built up.

Explain to me what a high-performing qubit is.

Yeah, so the tricky thing with these qubits… There are different ways of building qubits. There are people who use ions and atoms and electrons and things like that, but ours are actually just metal on a substrate; they’re circuits. They’re much like the circuits that you might see when you look inside of a standard chip. But the problem with these circuits is that you can build, so you can basically arrange them in a certain way and use the right materials. And you have a qubit that, in this case, for superconducting qubits, it resonates at five gigahertz.

If you choose the wrong materials, the lifetimes of these qubits can be extremely short. So when we first started in the field of building superconducting qubits in 1999, superconducting qubits lasted for maybe like two nanoseconds, five nanoseconds. Today, we’ve gotten up to close to a millisecond, hundreds of microseconds to a millisecond. Already in numbers orders of magnitude longer. But that took many years of development. And at the point of a few hundred microseconds, we’re able to do all these complex operations that we’ve been talking about to push this utility scale that we discussed earlier. So that know-how to increase that lifetime comes down to engineering, comes down to understanding the core pieces that generate loss in the materials, and that’s something that we certainly have expertise at.

Tell me about the industry at large. So IBM has one approach: you said you’re using metals on a substrate. You’re leveraging all of the semiconductor know-how that IBM has. When you’re out in the market and you’re looking at all your competitors, Microsoft is doing something else, Google something else. Go through the list for me. What are the approaches, and how do you think they’re going?

When we think about competitors, you can think about the platform competitors of who’s building the services, but I think what you’re pointing to more is the hardware side.

When it comes down to it, there’s a simple set of metrics for you to compare the performance of the quantum processors. It’s scale: what number of qubits can you get to and build reliably? Quality: how long do those qubits live for you to perform operations and calculations on? And speed: how quickly can you actually run executions and problems through these quantum processors? And that speed part is something where it’s an interplay between your quantum processor and your classical computing infrastructure because they talk to one another. You don’t control a quantum computer without a classical computer. And so you need to be able to get your data in, data out and process it on the classical side.

So scale, quality, speed. Our approach with superconducting qubits, to the best of our knowledge, we can hit all three of those in a very strong way. Scale, pushed up to over 1,000 qubits. We know that we can build up to 1,000 qubits already with the technologies that we’ve built. From the quality, Heron — which we’re releasing — has the best gate quality. So the gates, the operations, the gate qualities that have been shown across a large device. And then speed, in terms of just the execution times, we’re on the order of microseconds for some of the clock rates, whereas other approaches can be a thousand orders of magnitude slower.

What are the other approaches in the industry that you see, and where are they beating you and where are you ahead?

So there are trapped ions: basically they’re using molecular ions like caesium and things that you might use for clocks, atomic clocks. They can have very good quality. In fact, there are some results that have tremendous performance across a number of those types of trapped-ion qubits in terms of their two-qubit gate qualities. But they’re slow. In terms of the clock rates of getting your operations in, getting your operations out, you do operations to recycle the ion sometimes. And that’s where it, I’d say, has a downside.

I’d say, right now, superconducting qubits and trapped ions are the approaches that have the most prominence at the moment that have been put out in terms of usable services. Atoms have also emerged; it’s very similar to the trapped ions. There, they use these fun little things called optical tweezers to hold atoms into little arrays. And there are some exciting results that have been coming out from various atom groups there. But again, it comes down to that speed. Anytime you have these actual atomic items, either an ion or an atom, your clock rates end up hurting you.

Alright, let me make a comparison to semiconductors again. So in semiconductors there was multiple pattern lithography that everyone chased for a minute, and it hit an end state. And then TSMC had bet really big on EUV and that let them push ahead. And Intel had to make a big shift over there. You’re looking at your roadmap, you’re doing superconductors, cryogenics, metals on substrates, and over here some guys are doing optical tweezers on atoms. Is there a thought in your head like, “We better keep an eye on this because that might be the process innovation that we actually need”?

I think overall, in the landscape, we’re always keeping track of what’s going on. You’re always seeing what are the latest innovations in the various different technologies.

Is that even a good comparison to semiconductors in that way?

The whole systems are completely different. The architectures are not so compatible. At some level, with your nodes of your semiconductors, there might be certain kinds of know-how that translate how you route and layout, maybe. And here, above a certain layer, there’s also going to be commonality in terms of the compute platform, how the quantum circuits are generated. The software layers might be similar, but the actual physical hardware are very different.

It feels like the thing we’re talking about is how do you make a qubit? And it’s not settled yet. You have an approach that you’re very confident in, but there’s not a winner in the market.

I mean, we’re pretty confident. We’re pretty confident in superconducting qubits.

Fair enough. [Laughs] I was just wondering.

It’s why we’re able to prognosticate 10 years forward, that we see the direction we’re going. And to me it’s more that there are going to be innovations within that are going to continue to compound over those 10 years, that might make it even more attractive as time goes on. And that’s just the nature of technology.

You’ve got to make decisions on maybe the longest timeline of anyone I’ve had on the show. It’s always the chip people who have the longest timelines. I talk to social media CEOs, and it’s like their timeline is like five minutes from now, like, “What are we going to ban today?” That’s the timeline. I talk to chip folks, and your timelines are decades. You just casually mentioned a chip you’re going to ship in 2033. That’s a long time from now. How do you make decisions on that kind of timeline?

There’s the near-term stuff, obviously, and the roadmap serves as that guide. That roadmap is constructed so that all these various things do impact that long-term delivery.

Just walk me through: What does the quantum computing roadmap meeting look like? You’re all in a conference room, are you at the whiteboard? Paint the picture for me.

“It’s mainly an inertia thing to move entire industries, move banks, move commerce, to adopt those standards”

Yeah, that is a great question. I mean, we have a number of us who are sitting there. We certainly know that we have certain types of technical foundations that we know that we need to include into these next-generation chips and systems.

For this roadmap, we said, “We know at some point we need to get quantum error correction into our roadmap.” And with that technical lead, we know what are the requirements? So first we said, “Okay, let’s put it here. Now let’s work backward. It says that we need to do this innovation and this innovation by this date, and this other innovation in the software stack or whatever by this date.” And then we say, “Oh shoot, we ran out of time. Let’s move back a little bit.” And so we do a little bit of that planning, because we also want to do it so that we lay out this roadmap that we often call no-regrets decisions. We don’t want to do things that are just for the near term. We want to really pick strategies that give us this long-term path.

It’s why we talk about utility scale so much in terms of what we can do with Herons and soon Flamingos. But everything that we want to build on top of what we can do there will translate to what we can do when we get those systems at scale, including error correction. And in terms of the roadmap planning… We’re not done, by the way. We have this overall framework for the 10-year roadmap, and then we need to refine. We’ve got a lot of details still to come to work on in terms of what are those things that need to be worked on across the software layer, the compiler layer, the control electronics layer, and certainly at the processor layer.

Is there commercial pressure on this? Again, this is a lot of cost at a big public company. Is the CEO of IBM in that room saying, “When’s this going to make money? Move it up”?

I think the point is, our mission is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. I’ve been working in this area for 20 years now. We’ve never been this close to being able to build something that is driving real value. And so I think when you look at our team, we are all aligned along that mission. That we want to drive this to something that… We started with just getting it out there in the cloud in terms of building the community. Now, we fundamentally see this as a tool that will alter how users are going to perform computation. And so there has to be, and I expect there to be, value there. And we’ve seen how the HPC community has progressed and we’ve seen how supercomputing has... You could see what’s happening with the uptake of AI and everything. We build it, we will build the community around it, we’ll drive value.

Let’s talk about AI for a second. This is a really good example of this. AI demand is through the roof. The industry is hot. We’ll see if the products are long lasting, but there seems to be real consumer demand for them. And that is all translated into a lot of people want a lot of Nvidia H100 chips. It’s very narrowly focused on one kind of processor. Do you see quantum systems coming into that zone where we’re going to run a lot of AI workloads on them? Like future AI workloads.

What’s happened in AI is phenomenal, but we’re not at the point where the quantum computer is this commodity item that we’re just buying tons of chips. You’re not fabricating millions of these chips. But we are going to build this supercomputer based off of quantum computing, which is going to be exquisitely good at certain types of tasks. And so the framework that I actually see is … already you’re going to have your AI compute clusters. The way that people run workloads today, I’m sure they are running some parts on their regular computers, on their own laptops, but parts of the job get fed out to the cloud, to their hyperscalers, and some of them are going to use the AI compute nodes.

We see that also for how quantum will feed in. It’ll be another part of that overall cloud access landscape where you’re going to take a problem, you’re going to break it down. You’re going to have parts of it that run on classical computing, parts of it that might run on AI, parts of it that will leverage what we call quantum-centric supercomputing. That’s the best place to solve that one part of the problem. Then it comes back, and you’ve got to stitch all that together. So from the IBM perspective, where we often talk about hybrid cloud, that’s the hybrid cloud that connects all these pieces together. And differentiation is there in terms of building this quantum-centric supercomputer within there.

So your quantum-centric supercomputer in the cloud. We’ve talked a lot about superconducting now. You need a data center that’s very cold. This does not seem like a thing that’s going to happen locally, for me, ever, unless LK-99 is real. This isn’t going to happen for anyone in their home outside of an IBM data center for quite some time.

I would say this. So when I was first working in this area and did my PhD in this area — I worked on superconducting qubits — we required these large canisters, these refrigerators, where we need to wheel up these huge jugs of liquid helium and fill them every three days to keep them cold. Now, that’s a physics experiment. I mean, there have already been innovations in cryogenics that they’re turnkey: you plug them in, they stay running, they can run for years and maintain your payloads at the right temperatures. You’re paying electricity, obviously, to keep them cold. But we’re seeing innovations there, too, in terms of driving infrastructure-scale cryogenics. Honestly, we’re going to evolve the data center of the future, just like data centers today have evolved to handle increased compute resources needed. We will work hand in hand with how to build these quantum data centers, and we’re already doing that. So we have a quantum data center up in Poughkeepsie, which hosts the majority of our systems, and we’re planning on expanding that further.

I think AI has very much complicated the question of what you’re allowed to do with a computer chip. The White House just released an executive order about AI. And somewhere in there is the idea that you should not be able to do some things with AI. And I talked to AMD CEO Lisa Su at the Code Conference, and I said, “Would you accept a regulation that limits what people can do on an AMD chip?” And she said, “Well, yeah, we might have to. There might be some stuff we just don’t let these computers do anymore.” Which is very challenging when you’re talking about someone’s laptop.

It is way less challenging when you’re talking about a data center. Like AWS can just keep you from doing a workload. IBM, I’m sure, has rules and regulations about what its cloud is capable of doing and what you will allow to be done with its cloud computing. You fast-forward quantum, people are worried that you’re going to break AES encryption with quantum one day, and then the world will fall apart because the world runs on AES encryption. Are you thinking about that yet: there’s some stuff we should not allow people to do? And as we build the cloud system, we should make sure we put the controls in place?

There are certainly threads of that type of discourse, especially throughout the community. Personally, what I see is, the encryption one, we already know that there are quantum-safe encryption standards. And a fun thing is, in terms of IBM Quantum, our mission is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. The other side of it is make the world quantum-safe. We want to actually help clients figure out how to update their encryption standards to those quantum-safe ones. They exist. NIST has approved a number of them, which it’s mainly an inertia thing to move entire industries, move banks, move commerce, to adopt those standards.

I can’t get people to stop using four-character passwords. Will you talk to them?

Yeah, right. Exactly, that’s the challenge. And it’s almost a social challenge that needs to be overcome to make that happen. Removing that, if we look across at what you can or cannot do on quantum computers, I honestly think we need to just watch what’s happening with AI, see what’s been done in the past with high-performance computing. Again, not everybody has a high-performance computer at home. And so we expect a lot of the frameworks to be very similar. And so my concern about putting too many safeguards around it early is stifling progress, is stifling the development early.

But this conversation is now happening, I would say, in a much more heated way in the AI space. I mean, it’s almost like two religions are competing to see what the future of AI will be: “Just run as fast as you can” and “We should have more safety.” And this culminated potentially in whatever happened at OpenAI.

That’s right.

Who knows? We still don’t know. I don’t even know if that’s the case. But that is one narrative about that chaos that certainly exists. Is there anything like that in Quantum? Are there Quantum researchers who are like, “That person is out of control”? Name names. [Laughs]

No, we’re not at that stage yet, I’d say. But there are responsible quantum computing initiatives. There are things that are looking at it, and I think there’s a lot to lean on in terms of learning from what’s happening right now with those AI stories.

What’s the thing — outside of just the pure entertainment value — what’s the thing about AI accelerationism that you’ve pulled into how you’re thinking about your roadmap and building the systems?

“It’s always cool to see tremendous excitement about computing capabilities”

It’s actually really cool. Something that we’re talking about at our computing summit, too, is that we have Watsonx at IBM, and we actually brought in some GenAI methods to help users program in Qiskit. So there’s actually an engine that we built there to help users code that we’re going to be previewing. And then another thing is that translating problems into the right circuits that can run on physical hardware is a very challenging task. It, in itself, is an optimization task in terms of there’s a particular problem you want to run, and my hardware is configured in this particular way. We call that transpilation: how to map one to the other. And our teams actually used AI methods to find basically more optimal paths of that mapping. It’s actually really fun in that AI impacts how we can accelerate quantum. There’s another flip side, which is we are looking into how quantum can actually boost classification methods for AI. So it’s all tied together in some ways here.

Has that changed your roadmap, the explosion of demand for AI systems? A year ago, there was no ChatGPT. Now we’re sitting at the end of it, and I’m going to go to CES in a couple of weeks and everyone’s going to tell me that AI’s in everything. The industry just sort of reacts to buzzwords. Has this moved your path at all?

This AI transpilation thing did come in all of a sudden and is part of our roadmap. It’s an innovation, and now we want to feed it into something that we want to drive toward product. So in that micro sense, it has. In the more macro sense, I just say that it’s always cool to see tremendous excitement about computing capabilities. If the buzz stayed more on the AI and let quantum off the hook for a little bit, it’s not so bad.

Wow. The encryption doomers are like, “Pay attention to us.” There are some problems that quantum has always been promised to solve: molecular behavior, mapping proteins. Some of those problems have been attacked by AI very directly. We just had Demis Hassabis on the show — obviously DeepMind, they just did proteins. It’s done now, you can have it, we’re going to walk away. Is there an overlap between where AI is expanding to in terms of the problem set or what it can do that is competitive with what you want to accomplish with quantum?

I’m not the foremost expert about what molecular problems can be solved here. But I can at least say that we know that there are certain sizes and certain scales of problems that, in terms of supercomputing resources, push summit, push frontier to its max limits of what users can actually simulate. Again, I don’t know how much of that can actually be looked at using AI for approximate methods, but even then, it’d still be approximate methods. And here’s where quantum is really going to be something that allows one to look at it differently.

When you’re looking at what you have right now — you have partners, you have potential customers, you have people interested — what’s the largest volume of interest from the community?

There are those that are using various materials. For example, Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Lab, those that already use high-performance computing. They are super interested in using our platforms. Boeing actually has been working with us for quite a bit. They’re just looking at super tough problems like composites of materials and layers of materials and how best to arrange them. And they have problems with thousands of variables that are tremendous, that basically cannot work on classical computers. And we’ve been working with them to understand how to map their problems into quantum. And then you have the financial services industry. You have a number of players there that are looking at things like portfolio optimization, trying to understand all these things.

It’s always portfolio optimization, man. At the end of the day, it’s like Boeing’s doing some cool shit and portfolio optimization. It’s always lurking in the background somewhere. It’s fine, they pay the bills. It’s good.

You’ve been talking a lot about the cloud. You’ve got your cloud systems. You’ve also put System Ones on college campuses. How does that work? You buy a System One, it’s got some qubits in it. Is there a person rolling the helium up to it?

They’re still owned by IBM. They’re actually managed services deployed on the premises of the client locations. So we have one actually that, earlier this year, is with Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. That’s probably the most interesting place that we’ve deployed a system, in that it’s in their cafeteria.

That’s amazing.

People have their morning coffees and eat their lunch around it.

And that’s just a self-contained local supercomputer.

You can think of it as a self-contained, local managed service that they’re able to build a network and ecosystem around with their researchers, other partner university institutions that might want to use it. So that’s sort of the idea. Again, we have our main data center and cloud-accessible systems as you had mentioned. And you have these other ones that you drive regional ecosystems. And we’re actually launching a European data center around our system over in Germany next year because, in different locations, people care about how their data is handled. And so then you never have to send information overseas and things like that. So at that level, we can certainly build that type of flexibility into how we manage that service in terms of user data and everything.

Part of the news today is System Two. Do you have System One customers who are like, “Oh, shit, I should have waited”? How does that work with a quantum supercomputer? Is there an upgrade cycle?

Even with our System Ones, we’ve actually upgraded those over time. And again with our roadmap, some of them, we in fact first launched with 27-qubit Falcons. As an example, we just announced that our system in Japan with the University of Tokyo got upgraded to a 127-qubit Eagle processor. But in terms of the infrastructure from System One to System Two, it’s wholly different. So System One is great in that it first showed that we can put these things almost anywhere — a cafeteria, for example. You didn’t have to be in a physics laboratory for them to function.

It’s hard to miss. Image: Ryan Lavine for IBM

And in the cafeteria there’s the superconducting, super-cooled cryogenic system?

Yeah. Like I say, you have your morning coffee…

And you’re just looking at it.

…next to a really, really cold 15 millikelvin quantum processor.

Do people know it’s there? Is there a sign?

It’s hard to miss. [Laughs] It’s this glass box that is... Actually, funny story is that we work with this vendor, Goppion, that actually handles the glass that encases the Mona Lisa to help build the enclosures for our systems.

That’s cool. Alright, so System Two.

Yeah. So System Two: whole new level of infrastructure. But it’s designed to scale. And so that’s where certainly upgradeability and modularity is inherently built into it. You want to increase the number of processors, increase the cryogenic cooling environment? We can do that. Like Lego, like modular blocks. You want to increase the amount of control electronics? We can do that. You want to increase the amount of classical computation to interface with the quantum computer? We can do that, too. That’s the idea behind System Two, that it’s really designed for scalability in a modular way within a data center environment.

So IBM is announcing a new chip, new supercomputer, System Two, new roadmaps. If you’re just a regular person and you’re looking at the pace of supercomputer development, what should you be looking out for?

I’d say that you’ve just got to be looking out at the fact that it’s actually not hard to get started and learn about it. There’s an entire set of resources that you can go and program a quantum computer tomorrow. And the fact that we have this 10-year roadmap, and the fact that we are building this ecosystem and driving toward these new generations of chips and systems, we want to develop the developer of the future. And so if you’re at all interested in learning about using a quantum computer and getting involved, there’s a tremendous opportunity for growth here. And we’re going to need that. To build an entire industry, and to build this as a computer platform that works together seamlessly with today’s most high-performance computers, is going to require a groundswell of people. So to me, you touch so many different people out there, it’s like, get out there. You can run and program a quantum computer tomorrow. We have freely available systems to run circuits on.

Stop playing around with your LLMs; get on the quantum train. That’s what I’m taking away from this.

Yeah.

Alright. Last very silly question. When you watch the Ant-Man movies, are you just furious all the time?

I’d say that the first few Ant-Man movies, some of the quantum focus was interesting, it was cute. But the most recent one where they had an entire civilization inside, oof.

It’s a little rough.

That was a little rough.

Alright, Jerry, this was amazing. Thank you so much for coming on Decoder.

Yeah, you’re very welcome. Glad to be here.",technology
"One attraction of Binance, as the company grew from its 2017 founding into the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, was the firm's freewheeling flouting of rules. As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.

Then, late last month, those years of brushing off US regulators caught up with the company in the form of one the most punitive money-laundering criminal settlements in the history of the US Justice Department. The crackdown doesn't just mean a chastened Binance will have to change its practices going forward. It means that when the company is sentenced in a matter of months, it will be forced to open its past books to regulators, too. What was once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users' transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement.

When the Department of Justice announced on November 21 that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on that settlement focused on founder Changpeng Zhao giving up his CEO role and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and regulators. The company has agreed to comply with regulators' ""requests for information""—a term that carries none of the evidence or suspicion requirements necessary for obtaining a warrant or even a subpoena—to the point of producing any ""information, testimony, document, record, or other tangible evidence.""

Binance has also agreed to scour all of its transactions from 2018 to 2022 and file suspicious activity reports (SARs) for anything it deems a potential violation of US law from that five-year period. That “SAR lookback” means the company will now be actively scrutinizing its customers in retrospect, not just passively assenting to regulators poring over its databases. Those SARs are collected by FinCEN, the Treasury Department's financial crimes division, but then made available to law enforcement agencies from the FBI to IRS Criminal Investigations to local police. And all of this new scrutiny will be overseen by a ""monitor"" firm chosen by the US government but paid by Binance—an in-house watchdog assigned to make sure Binance is complying in good faith.

""I don't think Binance's customers have the slightest clue of the ramifications of this plea and consent decree. It's unprecedented,"" says John Reed Stark, who spent 20 years as an attorney at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including as the founder of its Office of Internet Enforcement. “If they're a drug dealer or a terrorist or a child pornography peddler, they're going to get caught."" He describes Binance's agreement as a ""24/7, 365-days-a-year financial colonoscopy.""

One US prosecutor, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to media about the case, calls the degree of access to Binance's records described in the agreement ""kind of crazy,"" and remains in disbelief at the idea of Binance abiding by the settlement. ""I don't know what kind of business would want to operate while allowing that much government oversight, especially one that's deliberately stayed out of the US so that they're not under our nose,"" they say. ""The other option must have been really bad.""",technology

[bomb exploding]

I'm a historian of nuclear weapons.

[bomb exploding]

And today I'm here to talk about the science

behind Oppenheimer.

[upbeat music]

So that's a scene of them assembling the gadget.

This is clearly based on some pictures that have come out,

and they're not a ton of pictures

showing this level of assembly

that have been declassified and released.

All the pictures we have of this are black and white.

The people who actually saw it described it

as being a sort of peach colored, a sort of tan colored.

Each of those wedges are several layers of high explosive.

So there are sort of variants of TNT

called explosive lenses, and they are putting them

around the plutonium sphere that powers the whole thing.

This is about the size of a grapefruit

So plutonium's solid metal.

Imagine you had a piece of steel and I said,

push it on all sides to make it smaller.

You need to shrink it by half its size

exactly symmetrically.

Each of these are the detonators.

When they all go off,

they're gonna start a shockwave through this device.

It's gonna start going in, in, in.

Inside that little sphere of plutonium

is an even tinier sphere of polonium and beryllium.

This thing, if you compress it, will shoot out some neutrons

that's meant to just start the reaction.

You push the whole thing together

and make an atomic bomb explode.

This is called implosion.

One of the things we see in the movie

is the final assembly of the gadget.

This is based on actual footage that was taken at the time.

Even the lighting looks like

in the historic footage that we have.

This is a hundred foot tower.

They have brought the explosive sphere

out to the test site by the tower

and they put a big tent around it.

You need this thing to be as controlled as possible.

If you got a pebble in there, it could deform the shock wave

by just enough to make the whole thing either not work

or not work very well.

So they want this to be a very pristine sort of environment,

which is hard to do when you're in the middle of the desert.

They're putting in in this scene

what's called the tamper plug.

The goal is to have this sit right around the plutonium core

in the middle of the bomb.

This is a delicate operation.

This tamper plug arguably is worth $400 million

in 1945 money.

They don't wanna mess this up,

because once you put the plutonium in there,

every little step of getting it closer to being a bomb

makes it a little bit more dangerous to be around

and radioactively, you know, problematic.

This core is like on the edge of being explosive.

It's also radioactive, it's also hot.

Plutonium in that quantity is so radioactive

that it's about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

They're dropping it through the center of the bomb.

They've made a sort of trap door basically

into the bomb so that the lens on top can come out.

You can drop this thing in.

In real life, they went to put it in and it didn't fit.

Oh my God, have we totally messed this up?

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

It had to be the right temperature for it to fit.

The outer part was cooler than the inner part was,

and so they had to wait for them

to reach the same temperature,

and then it just slid into place.

So there had to be one person left in the tower

to set it all up at the very end, stay with the bomb,

do the final connections, and then head back.

And this was, of course, a very stressful job.

They had previous mock-ups

that were set off by lightning in the distance,

so they were in a very precarious state here.

There's a scene before the actual Trinity test

where General Groves is asking Oppenheimer

about the possibility of this test destroying the world.

[Groves] There's a chance that when we push that button,

we destroy the world?

One of the real concerns was this problem

of what they called atmospheric ignition.

What if the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere

fuse together and release energy?

Could they release enough energy

that that would trigger more nuclear fusion

that then goes over the entire globe

and leaves at a burnt horrible cinder?

Turns out that kind of equation is really hard to do,

but let's imagine that it's like 100 times easier

than we think it is.

We can sort of make very conservative extrapolations

and we find it's probably not gonna happen.

Chances are near zero.

Near zero.

What do you want from theory alone?

Oppenheimer is giving the correct scientist's answer.

They basically concluded

it would be less than one in 3 million, something like that.

In the 1970s, weapon scientists redid those calculations.

Could you set the earth on fire if you wanted to?

Yes, but you need bombs

that would be hundreds of thousands of times

more explosive than any bombs we ever made.

And you'd need to have a much higher proportion

of the ocean be made out of a rare isotope called deuterium,

a different type of hydrogen.

If you had this, you could indeed turn the earth into a sun.

The detonation took place very late at night.

They wanted to see exactly how bright it was,

and it's gonna be harder to see that in the daytime

when you're competing with the actual sun.

They actually had recommended

that the bombs be dropped on Japan at night

because they would be more psychologically stunning.

But for logistical reasons,

they were dropped in the morning on both of the cities.

So those numbers you see are nixie tubes.

Those are a pre-digital way to display numbers.

It's a very nice period-appropriate touch.

So at this point, the gadget, as they called it,

is fully assembled.

You can tell that because the wires are sticking out the top

on the front, that's called the X Unit,

that's the firing unit, it's assembled.

To set off this kind of bomb,

you have to send a high voltage electrical signal

to 32 separate places at exactly the same time.

Nanosecond tolerances on the timing to have it work right.

And then they have a wire

going all the way back to base camp.

And if you hit the big button on the wire.

Detonator charged.

[Alex] You're telling the bomb,

go ahead and explode, and it will.

[nuke exploding]

In the movie Oppenheimer,

the Trinity test is one of the climax moments.

It's ridiculously bright,

much, much brighter than the actual sun.

What Oppenheimer's putting on here are welding goggles,

and these are so dark

that you really can't see anything in them

except something that is as bright as the sun.

There were a few people at the Trinity Test

who'd looked at the explosion

without anything over their eyes.

One of them, by accident, he dropped his goggles,

and one of them on purpose.

They both suffered from what was called flash blindness,

temporary blindness.

You'll see a big dark spot

over your vision for quite some time.

There were people who were relatively close,

thousands of yards.

Oppenheimer in the sort of control bunker,

much closer than a lot of the outlying ones.

Most of the people that were instructed to lay down

away from the blast so that they don't turn around

and either get knocked over or get a face full of dust.

So the Trinity test was heavily, heavily documented

both by pressure gauges and cameras

with telephoto lenses from a very far distance,

but some of them were closer in bunkers.

Anytime you see a closeup

and it's sort of like a wall of fire,

there are shots from the actual Trinity test

that looked pretty similar to that.

Interestingly, on some of the very earliest shots

where they were trying to get

the very first moments of the fireball,

it was hot enough that it burned holes in the film.

This particular shot is interesting

because this is what they call in the business a rope trick.

And they only show up when you can take pictures

that are 1,000 frames per second or something like this.

You have a tower with a bomb on it

and it's got wires stabilizing the tower,

and there's a little tendril of the fireball

that's going faster than the rest

because it's blowing up the wire as it goes down there.

No one at Trinity could have actually seen this.

What you're seeing here is the complex interaction

that happens when the blast wave hits the ground,

goes straight down, bounces back up,

and then intersects with that blast wave coming out.

There's a really big difference

in how the blast wave behaves

from a bomb that's right on the ground

from one that's a little bit in the air.

They want this, what's called the mach stem,

to have a wide area of destruction.

That's how you maximize the blast pressure,

detonating very high above the ground.

They're gonna use that data

to set the altitude of the atomic bomb over Japan.

When they went into the Trinity test,

their sort of best guess

was it would maybe be 4,000 tons of TNT.

It ended up being more powerful than they thought

by a factor of like 5, 20,000 tons of TNT equivalent.

This is enough to destroy a sort of medium-sized city.

If you're a much bigger city, like say New York City,

it's enough to destroy like Midtown.

So this is one of the reasons why Trinity is so important.

It's not just it works.

They find out it works really well.

So the Manhattan Project is this gigantic endeavor.

It's this massive industrial project

and employs like 500,000 people.

It's like 1% of the civilian labor force,

and it cost like $2 billion in their money,

which is like 1% of the whole cost of World War II.

They use 1% of all the electricity in the country

to make these weapons.

They're building an industry in like two and a half years,

and the output of that industry

is a very tiny amount of material.

A 6 kilogram plutonium core, 13.5 pounds,

that's the one they first test at Trinity.

About 64 kilograms, so about 120 something pounds

of highly enriched uranium, uranium 235,

that's for the bomb that's gonna be dropped on Hiroshima.

And then they have one more plutonium core.

That's the one they're gonna end up dropping on Nagasaki.

So all of that effort

is to make these three cores for the bombs.

And they had one more bomb in the pipeline.

They ended up never sending it, the war ended.

Many of these people talked about this

as the best years of their life in some ways.

They had a lot of fun,

and some of them felt quite guilty about that

after Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Oppenheimer's a really complicated character.

What he said he regretted was that after World War II,

they continued to make more weapons

and they continued to make bigger weapons

and they continued to make the kind of world

that he thought would ultimately put

civilization itself in danger.

In the years to come,

it will be possible to kill 40 million American people

by the use of atomic bombs in a single night.

[Alex] He knew in 1945 that there were ideas on the table

for bombs that would be thousands of times more powerful,

and that the nations of the world

could all get them if they wanted them,

and that a war with bombs of that big

could be fatal for the entire species.

And so that's the sort of paradox of Oppenheimer,

this person who wants peace, but he does it through war.",technology
"But in other important ways, O’Connor eschewed a facile ideological template that would lend itself to easy forecasting. For her critics, her approach to the law could seem erratic and unpredictable. For those looking more closely, however, her decisions and her reasoning demonstrated a constant attention to the proper role of the Supreme Court as a nonpartisan arbiter of hot-button issues in American life, to the actual facts about the actual parties, and to the way in which the bench’s rulings would be experienced by the American public.

Hers was a humane, pragmatic jurisprudence — qualities that are too often lacking in today’s Supreme Court. These values were embodied in her approach not just to high-salience issues such as abortion, but also in somewhat less noticed disputes about the Fourth Amendment and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. It’s a legacy worth spotlighting.

Inevitably, the decision that will be most recalled today is the plurality opinion O’Connor penned along with Justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In Casey, the Republican-appointed judges decided not to use their sheer force of numbers to overrule Roe v. Wade, and it stands in stark contrast to the work of President Donald Trump’s three appointees in Dobbs v. Jacksonville Women’s Health.

Casey matters not only because of its effect on reproductive freedoms, but for what it says about how the justices choose either to sustain or undermine the rule of law. O’Connor understood how important it was that citizens didn’t perceive their rights to turn on the impenetrable uncertainties of who got elected, who died, who resigned, and who could get through the Senate.

O’Connor explained why she would not just vote her own politics in the (much maligned) first line of her Casey opinion: “Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.” Here, she echoes thinking about the rule of law going back to Aristotle. Simply put, a legal system diminishes liberty by the sheer fact of being unpredictably open to the whims of particular officials. O’Connor would later go on to champion the rule of law, but her insight into how the court must behave if legality is to be preserved is most powerfully on display in Casey.

At the same time, O’Connor was capable of profound empathy for the actual litigants before the court. Consider a little-noticed case that, in practice, deeply shapes Americans’ experience with police. Atwater v. City of Lago Vista asked whether a police officer could spitefully take advantage of a minor traffic misdemeanor (failure to wear a seat belt) to arrest a woman, separating her from her minor children. The court said “yes,” over a vigorous dissent by O’Connor.

Atwater is one of those “minor” cases that, on the ground, is incredibly consequential: It surely matters to many people whether they can be locked up because they fail to use their seat belt. The court’s ruling gave police a startling and destabilizing new power over citizens. O’Connor’s eloquent and passionate dissent captured the far-reaching way in which the court’s ruling shook the life not just of Gail Atwater but of millions of Americans on the road.

Finally, when it came to the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause and the separation of church and state, O’Connor was no less sensitive to people’s direct experiences with the law. In her view, the government violated religious neutrality by taking sides improperly in the religion-inflected culture wars if an “objective observer” would perceive “a state endorsement” of faith.

Here, O’Connor took seriously the idea that government favoritism between religions, and between the devout and the secular, can be destabilizing. She understood the potential for people to feel stigmatized and excluded by such religious partisanship. And her approach to the law centered those concerns by literally demanding that judges take the perspective of the citizen facing a seemingly biased state.

The strategy of the Roberts Court, however, has been strikingly different. There is no case during the Roberts Court in which the Establishment Clause has provided the necessary basis for invalidating a government practice. Rejecting claims under the Clause, the Roberts Court has also played fast and loose with facts in ways that would have seemed quite alien to O’Connor. The overall effect, a leading scholar of the First Amendment recently wrote, is that the court is “disestablishing” that part of the First Amendment — making it, in effect, a second-class right.

There is, of course, much in O’Connor’s record with which a person on the left or the right will disagree: That’s perhaps the inevitable result of being open to the facts of each new case, and empathetic to the experiences of their litigants. Yet if unpredictability is the cost for such fidelity to law and seriousness about justice, it’s hard to see why the price is not worth paying.

"Yes, it's still going. We're still finding some decent Cyber Monday deals and this page will keep running until the end of the sale tonight. These are genuine deals, picked by the WIRED team, no hyped-up numbers here. And it's not just Amazon, we're also highlighting deals from Argos, Currys, John Lewis, Richer Sounds and Costco to name a few. For any deals that have sold out, we'll strike through them and reinstate when they pop back up. Enjoy.

WIRED's Cyber Monday Top Picks

This petite tower of power won our wireless speaker group test as the “best overall,” beating competition from Sonos and Sony. It’s a great-sounding, rucksack-friendly speaker, but one still large enough to do real justice to your favorite tracks. The blue and grey versions currently are selling at £30 off.

Hisense may not be the trendiest name in TVs but this deal does provide one of the most affordable ways to try out mini-LED technology. It allows for greater backlight control, which in return means better black and better contrast. Worth investigating if your budget won’t stretch to OLED TV territory.

One of our only criticisms of the WIRED Recommends Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones at review (9/10) was they were a bit pricey at launch. This Cyber Monday deal solves that by lopping £100 off the original cost, or around £40 off the more recent online pricing. They have excellent noise cancellation, truly absorbing sound and are super-comfy.

Sonos took its sweet time to make a portable speaker but, it didn’t mess up when it finally did. The Roam SL is the digital-assistant-free version of the company’s petite battery-powered speaker. And it still has Wi-Fi so can act like a standard Sonos unit when at home — it has Bluetooth when miles away from a Wi-Fi network. If you’re looking for something larger, the original Move is also available during Cyber Monday for £279.

Samsung can often seem to be outpaced by the Chinese phone-makers on the budget end, like Xiaomi and Realme. This deal more than levels the playing field. It’s not often we see a £250 phone that has IP67 water and dust resistance. The Galaxy S34 5G does. Its screen is also an excellent 120Hz Full HD-grade OLED. This deal is for the 256GB version, which typically costs £100 more over at Amazon.

The gaming monitor of your dreams? This might just be. It’s a 34-inch 1440p ultra-wide display with a QD OLED AW3423DWF panel from Samsung. We reviewed its predecessor from 2022 and gave it a WIRED Recommends award (9/10). The difference? This newer model has a quieter fan, lower latency in certain modes, upgradeable firmware, and more. It’s best suited to a dark room, as the reflection-busting polariser layer otherwise makes the technically perfect blacks appear raised, grey-ish.

“Mr Stark, I don’t feel so good…” It’s OK, you don’t have to relive the MCU’s most tragic moment. Give the gift of infinite art. Upload any image to Lego for bespoke brick mosaic instructions. This kit comes with 4,500 little 1x1 Lego plates, 900 in each of five colors, so you can switch to a new mosaic design any time including mid-Blip superheroes. Ages 10+ and definitely not just one for children.

Sony / WIRED

Despite selling like gangbusters since launch, you can get a healthy discount on the Sony PlayStation 5 right now. This is the full disc console, the one we’d recommend for ultimate flexibility. No, this isn’t the PlayStation 5 Slim announced in October, but that is one of the least interesting console updates ever. It’s not much smaller, doesn’t look all that different, and brings no notable performance changes.

You can’t beat a drone like this for B-roll footage that looks like it was shot on a proper budget. The Mini 2 SE’s is DJI’s affordable mini drone. It has a 12MP 1/2.3-inch sensor and can capture video at up to 2.7k resolution, 30 frames per second. The step-up DJI Mini 3 can shoot at 4K/30 and has a larger sensor that will hold up better during those tricky dusk scenes. However, the DJI Mini 2 SE is an ideal first non-toy drone. You may want to consider upgrading to the popular More Fly kit at £379. It includes two additional batteries (31-minute flight time a piece), a charger, and a bag.

This OLED TV from LG dukes it out with the Sony A80L as the set most people with a good amount of money to spend should consider buying. Richer Sounds offers £100 off the price you’ll find at other retailers. You just have to join the VIP Club, which involves giving them your email address, basically. LG also throws in a soundbar, one that sells for £180 right now direct from LG. The TV itself is excellent. Bright, color-accurate, and those OLED blacks make movies and games look fantastic.

Who needs the Meta Quest 3 when the older version is available new for just £200? At this price, we’d strongly recommend considering the older version if you are going to use both on-board wireless VR and PC VR. When hooked up to a PC the much greater power of the Quest 3 doesn’t matter so much. The resolution of this headset is still up there at 1920 x 1832 pixels per eye (in theory, but the horizontal resolution ends up a bit lower as there’s a single panel, not one per eye.) Just planning on using the headset solo? The Quest 3 is a significant upgrade. Shopping note: The price comes up as £250, but use the code VKEXL at checkout to get £50 cashback, applied as a credit to your method of payment.

At less than half the RRP, it’s tempting to buy two, but you’d never be able to carry them both at once. The Nepal’s large 85 liters is enough for long travels and expeditions. While its adjustable, padded, breathable back system keeps you comfortable despite the heavy load.

Laptops and Gaming Deals

Back at its release in 2022, this laptop would have cost around £1,300. It’s likely only so highly discounted during Black Friday because it uses a last-generation Intel Core i7-1260P processor. But in real-world use, you’d struggle to tell the difference between this and a laptop with a top-tier 13th Gen processor. We also get a super-vivid 1800p OLED screen, a 360-degree hinge, a bundled pressure-sensing stylus, and a glass touchpad that can turn into a light-up NUM pad at the touch of a button. Delightfully silly.

A solid-state drive (SSD) gives you heaps of space for storage or backups, like a hard drive but faster. WIRED picked this SanDisk as best for speed when we picked out our best portable storage drives. Imagine losing your files and photos… there’s no excuse not to back up your digital life with prices like this.

Prime candidate for best value gaming laptop of Cyber Monday, this. Costco members (sign up for £15 a year) can get a solid HP Victus with an Nvidia RTX 4060 for just £650. That’s a silly price for a card that gets you cutting-edge features like frame generation. It’s not the lowest-end model either. 16GB and 512GB SSD? A pair of glazed cherries on top. It does use an older 12th Gen Intel CPU, but it is from the punchy “H” series, so no worries here. A killer deal.

We won’t list every cheap video game deal here. Suffice it to say, it’s a good day to shop for games–whether physical copies or digital downloads–or stock up on virtual currency. But we have a soft spot for this title, which our reviewer called “one of the most arresting Final Fantasy entries to date”. Less than half price for Cyber Monday.

This is a previous-generation version of the Mac Studio. It has the M1 Max processor rather than the M2 Max you’d buy directly from Apple today. However, it’s loads cheaper than the newer model and is more powerful than the Mac mini with the M2 processor you’d be looking at for this sort of money. Costco has messed up the titling on this one, though. It’s the 10-core CPU version with a 24-core GPU. Factor in £15 for an annual Costco membership if you don't have one already.

Some of our favorite laptop deals of Cyber Monday so far have come not from a standard retailer, but Lenovo direct. This limited availability buy gets you a brilliant blend of power and portability. It weighs a reasonable 1.58kg but has a dedicated graphics card, the Nvidia RTX 3050. While this is a last-generation model, its specs are otherwise ultra-high. You get 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, and a full metal shell. Don’t buy it just for gaming, but as a portable workstation that can still play? It’s great.

Costco has, if anything, undervalued its own deal here. You’ll find this laptop selling at a Cyber Monday price of around £1300 elsewhere but listed with an original price of around £2000. That was about right for a laptop with an RTX 3080 graphics card. This thing is seriously powerful, even if it is from Nvidia’s previous generation. The 1440p screen with IPS panel and 165Hz, the Core i7 chipset, and 16GB RAM: it’s all fantastic for the cash. While you miss out on the latest frame generation feature of the latest GPUs, few can challenge it on raw performance for anything close to this money. Factor in the £15 membership required for online purchases.

Games laptops don’t have to cost a fortune, especially on Cyber Monday. Costco members (sign up for £15 a year) get this £130 reduction at checkout. It’s a great price considering the specs: AMD Ryzen 5 CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB SSD. It also comes with Nvidia’s RTX 3050 GPU, giving you the power you need to handle graphically demanding games, with a 144Hz refresh rate for smooth gameplay.

This is a great all-purpose family PC. It has a seriously powerful CPU, for wannabe YouTubers and programmers. Its large 15.6-inch screen is movie-ready. And while the Nvidia RTX 4050 is an entry-level card, it does have Nvidia’s relatively new frame generation tech. Thanks to this, the laptop can handle challenging games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, with no problem. Just don’t buy one expecting portability as it’s almost 3kg and is 27mm thick.

You’ll have trouble beating this Acer deal in terms of specs per pound. It has 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. You pay more than this laptop’s cost just to get these upgrades in a MacBook Air. The Intel Core i5 chipset is good too, even if it is a low-voltage CPU. You won’t see amazing color reproduction in its screen but models we’ve seen from this series before do at least use an IPS panel, avoiding the nasty look of a basic TN screen.

Meta holds regular sales over at its game store, but the Black Friday bunch provides some particularly good buys for new Quest 2 and Quest 3 owners. The Mysterious Expeditions bundle nets you three of the best puzzle adventures on the platform for £40 (Red Matter 2, the Room VR, and Eye of the Temple). Amid Evil VR is a fantastic “boomer” shooter, one well worth £9. Or you can pick up the Vader Immortal trilogy for around £15.

This is cheap-as-chips for an entry-level games PC and it looks the business too. The machine is based on a respectable AMD Ryzen 5 5600G with 8GB RAM and 500GB SSD. Just add a graphics card of your choice.

An Acer like this is one of the better buys of the moment for folks who want a mid-performance gaming PC that will also make a solid family PC. It uses a punch Intel Core i5-13400F CPU, one a good bit faster than the AMD Ryzen 5 5600 seen at this price. The Nvidia RTX 4060 will keep pace with games years into the future too. Its case may be a touch aggressive for some tastes, but at least it keeps the case LED lighting simple: just red light inside.

This is one of the few monitors that offers a better PC gaming experience than a standard OLED TV. It’s a curved OLED monitor with an ultra-wide aspect ratio of 21:9. The maximum refresh rate is much higher than that of consumer TVs too, at 175Hz. All you need now is an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card to go along with it. Take note of the connections before buying, as there’s no full-size HDMI so some setups will require an adapter.

The Cyber Monday tech equivalent of buying new socks, microSD deals are back for this year. Much as with October’s Prime Day, we recommend Samsung’s EVO Select line for most people. These cards are cheap, reliable, and perform well above their price with real-world read/write speeds close to 100MB/s.

LG’s Gram series asked “why can’t a 15-inch laptop weigh less than a kilo?” We used to be happy with the idea 1.3kg was the standard for portable 13-inch PCs, but the Gram family laughs at that nonsense. This is a 15-inch laptop that weighs 0.99kg. It’s a portability dream, and even has a powerful processor, OLED screen and long battery life. The rigidity of its panels takes a hit, though, and some of you will really want an above-Full-HD screen when spending a grand. Fair enough.

This would make an excellent alternative to a MacBook Pro. Its raw CPU power isn’t that far off Apple’s M2, it has a metal shell and, the highlight, a super-saturated 1800p OLED display with black levels not even Apple’s mini-LED screens can touch. It’s no good for gaming, but is otherwise a highly versatile laptop. You can also get the more powerful version with an Intel Core i7 CPU for an additional £200. This Core i5 model is the better buy, though, as both have a 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM.

Microsoft

Discounts on Xbox Series X consoles are rare, and this one is a corker. You can get the console alone for £90 less than its pre-price-hike cost. There are plenty of bundles floating around too. The best value is likely the Xbox Series X plus Diablo IV deal from John Lewis at £390.

The Steam Deck OLED is the PC gaming handheld to get if you ask us. But this is a legit deal for the Asus ROG Ally, even if we didn’t think much of it at review (3/10). An AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme makes this appreciably more powerful than the Steam Deck, although its battery lasts less long, in part thanks to its use of Windows rather than SteamOS.

Wearables and Fitness Deals

Peloton

The Peloton hype cycle of the early Covid months may have died down, but Peloton remains a cracking service if you can keep your motivation up. Its standard bike is down to £1,095, from £1,345. This gets you a top-quality static bike with 21-inch screen for just £100 more than the refurb price. The Peloton Bike+ with a bigger tilt display is one sale too, as are packages that include weights sets. Bear in mind you will need to pay £39 a month for the All-Access Membership, which is what gets opens up Peloton’s video workouts.

This is one of the most celebrated pairs of running shoes of the year, alongside its pricier Endorphin Speed 3 Pro, which uses a carbon plate for even better energy return. Many will prefer this non-Pro version for running, though, as its lower rigidity gives the shoe a softer, more pliant feel. It’s still fast enough to propel you to reach your next PB too. Speed is in the name, after all.

“They’re great, but they are a bit expensive for most people.” That’s a common reaction to Garmin’s higher-end watches like this Fēnix 7S. It’s the same as the Fēnix 7, but 42mm wide instead of 47mm; don’t be put off, 42mm is plenty big enough. Cyber Monday takes the edge off, bringing the cost down to that of a standard Apple Watch. The Fēnix 7S is more capable in several ways too. Radically better battery life. Support for on-watch maps and better intel for athletes.

We’ll level with you. Basic turbo trainers like this are as boring as Cyber Monday sock deals. But if you want a cheap way to get an indoor bike workout when the weather is just too bad to get out on the road, you’ve found it. £15 for a trainer like this is ridiculously cheap and means fewer pangs of guilt if it ends up gathering dust in the months of better weather. This one doesn’t make you take off your wheel, as the trainer clamps onto the axle, letting the tire sit on the trainer’s rear wheel part.

The Whoop band is a fitness tracker with a difference. There’s no screen here, no GPS to produce maps of your runs. However, it is a favorite of lots of fairly hardcore athletic types for its ability to judge how well-rested and ready for exercise you are. We know marathon runners who swear by this thing to balance their workout routine. This moderately tasty deal offers a band and a year of the subscription for £189, down from the usual £229.

You won’t find deals for Suunto’s watches everywhere, but the whole range has seen its prices chopped over at the Suunto official store. Our pick of the bunch is the Suunto 9 Peak, which is sleek for an enthusiast sports watch. It has a titanium casing, Sapphire screen protection, and is just 10.6mm thick. The software isn’t quite as slick or responsive as Garmin’s best, but the battery last up to two weeks and it has full GPS, plenty of tracking modes and on-watch navigation (but no downloadable maps.)

Fitbit has had a rocky ride since it was bought by Google in 2021. The Sense and Versa lost features, then gained new ones. And the Fitbit Charge 6 has been affected by GPS signal issues. Your safest bet is the rather charing Inspire 3, a cute and affordable band that doesn’t cost too much, and makes a decent outdoors exercise tracker if you bring your phone along with. It doesn’t have GPS, but does have a color screen, unlike the older Inspire models. It was runner-up in our best Fitbit test, after the Fitbit Charge 5, also available for £100 this Cyber Monday.

We like the look of this watch from Triwa. Its blue version has real punch in its use of color, and the internals are sound too. The watch uses a Japanese quartz movement for reliable time-keeping. As you might guess from the name, the body is made of recycled plastic. But it’s at least moderately tough too, with 10 ATM water resistance. Two additional smaller dials can keep track of other time zones.

The Epix 2 was the watch that proved the future of Garmin wearables is probably in OLED screens, not the practical but bland-looking transflective ones it used almost exclusively for years. Maps look great on this watch, and yet a charge can still last upwards of two weeks. This band has since been superseded by the Garmin Epix Pro, but the two key differences are a tweaked heart rate reader and a built-in LED flashlight. It’s a neat upgrade, but the standard Epix 2 is no slouch.

Phones and Tablet Deals

Xiaomi routinely delivers some of the best deals but rarely gets enough credit thanks to deals for the better-known Samsung and Pixel handsets. The Redmi Note 10 5G is stunning value at just-about £100. A full HD Gorilla Glass screen with a 5,000mAh battery and 5G internet? Not bad. The processor isn’t great for gaming and the IPS screen isn’t as good-looking as the step-up OLED ones, but you can get that by spending £25 more on the Redmi Note 12 (a 4G phone).

How powerful iPads have become is alarming. This iPad Air is as powerful as the 2020-series MacBooks, capable of playing games like Resident Evil: Village. You can get the 64GB edition of this tablet for £650 if you can make do with limited storage, but 256GB offers much more room for maneuver. This version of the iPad Air was announced in early 2022, but the range is not expected to see an update until well into 2024.

Samsung currently offers £250 off the brilliant Galaxy S23 Ultra. You can pick this one up direct, from John Lewis, Argos or others. Should you still pay a grand for a phone well over six months old? Usually we’d be pretty unconvinced, but this is quite an usual Android. Not only does it have a zoom range only one or two other phones get close to matching, with 3x and 10x cameras, it has an S Pen stylus that slots into its frame. It’s the mobile phone multi-tool. It earned a WIRED Recommends (9/10) badge earlier this year. Note: The price comes up as £1,249 on John Lewis but join My John Lewis and you get an £250 discount by entering the code S23ULTRA.

Here’s a solid alternative to the Amazon Fire HD 10 that will actually let you install (almost) any app you like, as it has access to Google Play. What you get here for the money here is quite excellent too. The Pad X9 has an aluminum casing, a 120Hz 11.5-inch screen with a solid 2000 x 1200 pixel resolution, and a large 7250mAh battery. Its processor, the Snapdragon 685, is quite low-powered, though. Don’t expect miracles with games like Fortnite and Genshin Impact.

Just a month after their release, the Google Pixel 8 phones are already on sale at £100 off. You can also save even more at Currys by trading in a phone. Even an ancient one will do, as long as it works. At review, we thought the Pixel 8 battery life was too short, but it performs well, and has a bright screen and a great set of cameras. The price comes up as £699, but use the code PIXEL100 at checkout to save a further £100.

This phone is a fairly direct rival to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus and beats it in a few areas. It has a sharper OLED screen, a larger battery, and higher-resolution 50MP secondary cameras. This is a powerhouse and is only seeing such a tasty discount here because Honor isn't quite a household name like Apple or Samsung. This is also the version with 512GB storage and 12GB RAM. So, the big question: can you get on with that giant camera ring on the back? It’s an audience divider.

Call the Vatican, we found a legit deal for a latest-generation iPhone. This is £80 less than you’d pay for the 128GB version of the iPhone 15 from Apple, and most partner retailers. This generation saw Apple finally adopt USB-C in place of the Lightning connector. It only earned this world-beater a 7/10 score at review, but you can only get so far with this year’s incremental updates. However, you will need to fork out £15 for a Costco membership to buy one.

This is Samsung’s previous-generation top foldable phone, a book-style monster that used to cost £1,649. Is it worth making do with last-gen when spending this much money? On paper, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Fold 5 aren’t all that different. The biggest change in person is the Galaxy Z Fold4 has a gap by the hinge, while the Galaxy Z Fold 5 folds properly flat. This makes it a thinner phone. Is that worth an additional £800? We’ll leave that one with you.

As is generally the case during these sales periods, you won’t actually find many amazing deals (aside from the Costco one above) for the latest iPhones. But you can save some cash on the previous-generation iPhone 14, with £50 off either the standard or Pro version. Changes in the newer 15-series generation weren’t mind-blowing, but camera resolution did get a bump from 12MP to 48MP, and the phones adopted USB-C over the Lightning connector.

You’ll find more impressive-sounding price drops here, but the Nothing Phone (2) is only a few months old and was a value-focused phone to begin with. It has the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, a last-gen flagship, dual 50 MP cameras, and a full metal and glass design. The outer appearance is the most striking part, though, with the light-up glyphs we saw in the original Nothing Phone (1), but refined. That first phone is available from £299, also worth a look.

Amazon Kindle discounts during sales periods appear with clockwork regularity. But they are still worth a highlight if you have been considering one of these stoic ereaders. The entire range from basic “Kindle” to Kindle Scribe gets a discount of up to 24%. For most people, the classic Paperwhite is the best buy. Great screen. Great clarity. Bath-ready IPX8 water resistance.

Headphones and Speaker Deals

Anker is renowned for delivering good value in its gear. The Anker Soundcore Space A40 earphones are no different. They have active noise cancellation, epic 10-hour battery life plus a case good for an estimated four recharges. The treble is a touch sibilant with some content but we were so impressed with the pair, they won a “runner-up” award in our headphones group test.

The Beats Fit Pro came away with the best earbuds award in our 2023 headphones group test. Unlike early Beats pairs, they have great tuning, they offer active noise cancellation, and a comfortable sport-ready fit. A top affordable alternative to the AirPods Pro earphones.

The Momentum range used to be a star of the mainstream headphone scene. Nowadays it sits in the shadow cast by Sony, Bose, and Bowers & Wilkins, but is still competitive when you actually listen to the Momentum sets. This latest generation offers improved active noise cancellation, up to 60-hour battery life, and a reworked sound signature. Expect fearsome sub-bass and unusually pronounced mids, although they’re best-used wireless-only as there’s a mid-range “honk” when not powered.

The Sonos Arc is the spiritual successor to the legendary Playbar, a high-end soundbar for folks who don’t want their living space cluttered with cables and speakers. It sounds crisp and refined. And if you do want to build up your Sonos setup, it can connect to a Sonos SUB and a pair of Sonos One SL or Era speakers, which can act as rear surrounds. You’ll usually pay a little over £100 more for this soundbar.

Planning a party? Great value for this portable speaker with powerful sound, wireless streaming, waterproof body, and a 12-hour battery life. Or pick up a deal on the JBL Charge 5 for £130 (£40 off) which extends battery life to 20 hours and doubles as a USB power bank.

These headphones are ancient, released in 2017 when the world was a different place. But it doesn’t matter because the Philips Fidelio X2HR is the polar opposite of today’s popular street headphones. They’re not tech-packed and don’t use a battery. You can’t really use them out of your home either, as their open backs leak sound and don’t block out noise. However, you’d be hard-pressed to find any better-sounding pair for £70. They provide balanced audio, with wide and open imaging. Ideal for late-night movies and gaming when loud surround sound is off the cards.

It’s only in the sales you'll get AirPods for two figures, so enjoy. Or if you want active noise canceling then AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) are now £199 (£30 off) including a MagSafe wireless charging case. There are good Cyber Monday deals to be had on the much-better 3rd Gen AirPods too. Apple itself runs an Apple Store Shopping Event, rather than discounting. So you can get an Apple Gift Card worth up to £60 when you buy AirPods directly from Cupertino.

Your best Bose buy for Cyber Monday is this pair of “SE” series Quietcomfort headphones. We called them dated in our original 7/10 review, but we can excuse that at this price. They sound smooth and have excellent active noise cancellation plus plush pads. What does the SE part mean? The standard Quietcomfort QC45 comes with a hard case and the cheaper SE with a softer case. Big whoop. If you want the white or green shades this series comes in, though, you will have to pay the £90 extra for the non-SE version.

This setup of affordable hi-fi separates features a Denon turntable, Cambridge Audio amp and Wharfedale speakers. The hi-fi bundle is perfect for anyone with a new–or rekindled–love of vinyl and includes cables. If Cyber Monday comparison shopping is stressing you out, relax in the knowledge that Richer Sounds will refund you the difference if the price drops any time between now and Tuesday 28th. Its best deals are for VIP Club members but the club is free to join, offers extended guarantees, and more.

An outstanding deal on this new-for-2023 soundbar which features 17 speakers, wireless Dolby Atmos surround sound, wireless subwoofer, Alexa voice control, AirPlay, and more. It adds stunning audio to your home AV setup without clutter. You can also save on its big sibling the Samsung Q990C Soundbar Speaker for £945 (£655 off) for an even bigger audio upgrade. WIRED picked last year’s model, its predecessor the 990B, as our Best Dolby Atmos Bar.

Want a soundbar on a budget? Look no further. This one-box Bose is 55cm wide, compact enough to fit under any size TV, connects via a single cable, and is a doddle to set up. Television, films, and games sound clearer immediately, a cure for muffled dialogue, and you can stream music to it via Bluetooth too.

Home and Grooming Deals

Get crafty this Cyber Monday. Deals abound for this compact cutting machine, but Hobbycraft is offering the best price. The machine cuts paper, card, foil, vinyl, stickers, you can even make custom iron-on decorations. There’s also a half-price deal on materials and accessories.

If you’re among the handful of people who haven’t bought an air fryer yet, this is a good place to start. It’s the smaller version of the Ninja model that won our air fryer group test way back in 2021. It has a 3.8L volume for food and takes up less space than many. And unlike the most basic air fryer models there are four modes: air fry, roast, reheat, and dehydrate.

Hipsters and lockdown haven’t entirely done for the shaver market. There’s still space for the clean-shaven and, if you are a smooth operator, Cyber Monday is the best time to pick up a less-than-half-price bargain. This wet-and-dry rechargeable is waterproof, so you can use it in the shower, with or without shaving oil or gel, to speed up your morning routine.

Want to warm yourself in the summer, cool yourself in the summer and purify the air a bit in the process? Look no further than this oscillating fan. It’s useful year-round and also boasts a remote control and sleep timer.

Why just buy an air fryer? This kitchen contraption is an air fryer, steamer, slow cooker, and more. You can also cook multiple things at once, as there’s a dual-layer structure inside. This one is best for smaller or medium-sized households, as it’s kinda a 30cm-ish cube with a moderate capacity of 5.7L.

Smart home kit is a top buy on Cyber Monday (see also Prime Day). Hue offers a wide range of smart light bulbs and lights, with good compatibility. Pick pendant or spots, white or color, and check bayonet or screw. This starter kit (well, the screw-fitting version) was named Best Bulbs in WIRED’s Hue best buys. Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit.

Note that this aluminum Tefal Ingenio set isn’t induction-compatible. But if you have any other style of hob, it’s a space-saving bargain. The handles pop off, so you can stack and store all eight pans, lids, and covers in the space of one. Non-stick and, once you take the handles off, oven-safe too. You get a 20-piece set for the price of the 13-piece set… yet it barely takes up more space.

This Cyber Monday deal definitely doesn’t suck: you can save up to £150 on various Dyson stick vacuums, air purifiers, and the like in its own sale this week. Get a good price on the latest stick vacuums like the V15, literally the best Dyson vacuum according to the WIRED team… or pick up other models, like the affordable Dyson Omni-glide vacuum for £200 (£100 off).

Amazon

Amazon originally offered a Cyber Monday BOGOF, buy one get one free, promo on the Show 5 smart display, but now it's just half price. You'll also find the cute Echo Pop speaker for just £18. These aren’t close to the top of any Amazon ranges, and we found the Echo Pop’s bass a wee bit weak. However, this is a great way to get your home tooled up on the cheap.

At this price, you can pop a Pop (see what we did there?) in every room without breaking the bank. Use Alexa voice assistant anywhere, not just to stream music, podcasts, and radio but also for smart home control. To that end, Amazon has some ludicrously cheap Cyber Monday deals to get you started: pick up an Echo Pop with a Philips Hue smart light bulb for £23 (£36 off) or with a Sengled Smart Plug for £23 (£37 off). Both, of course, work with Alexa.

This 65% discount is the attention-grabbing bargain if you want Emma’s lush, multi-layered mattress that promises to regulate your body temperature and absorb motion, but there are good deals to be had across the range. All with a 10-year guarantee and a 200-night trial.

Certain online department stores are selling this exact same model for £120, so grab a bargain. Its two drawers total 7.6 liters and cooking can be synced, so you can make a whole meal for the family or get priceless extra cooking capacity on Christmas Day (air fryers make brilliant roast potatoes, just sayin’). And it has a handy viewing window, a feature we rated when WIRED tested a smaller air fryer from Instant Brands.

A great value bundle of home security cameras from Amazon’s own brand. The two cameras are enough for smaller homes. For larger setups, there are deals on bigger bundles too – all at half price or less. The range includes a video doorbell and floodlights too. The setup is simple and they work with Alexa.

This is the kitchen gadget everyone wants in 2023. Ninja appears to have become the go-to brand for folks after a strongly recommended air fryer. It received plaudits in our air fryer group test, although it was the more multi-cooker-like Ninja Speedi (found below) that took away our top award. The Foodi Max is more of a straightforward air fryer, one with a mammoth 9.4L capacity, ideal for families rather than singletons or couples. The two drawers let you keep different elements separate, and manage timings more easily.

Is it even Cyber Monday if you don’t buy an electric toothbrush? Our pick of the pack for your pearly whites is this Oral-B at £55 off. It boasts AI brushing recognition (but doesn't go overboard with the AI features like some), pressure sensing, and app guidance and today it’s less than £90.

Dyson has an official eBay store that sells refurbished, cleaned, and tested Dyson electricals directly from the manufacturer and with a one-year guarantee. At these prices, you can’t lose. The eBay price comes up as £280, the same as the new Cyber Monday price on the Dyson site, but enter the code DYSONBF40 at checkout for a further 40% off, bringing the price down to a bargainous £168. Stock is limited.

We mention this one not because it’s a sensational deal, but because this is just about the time of year people consider buying a wake-up alarm clock to combat seasonal affective disorder. The Bodyclock Luxe 750DAB is Lumie’s top-end lamp and is the only one in the range with a DAB radio baked-in, rather than a crusty FM tuner or simply some wake-up sounds. It emulates a sunrise over a duration you choose, 15 to 90 minutes, gradually getting brighter and less warm-toned. It has Bluetooth too, for music streaming from a phone once you’re up.

Outdoors Deals

Hit up the Nike store today for Cyber Monday savings of up to 50% on Nike sneakers, Jordans and more. What’s more, you can save a further 25% if you’re a Nike Member by signing in and entering the code SPRINT23 at checkout today only–a savings slam dunk.

A 2022 electric model from one of the big names in bikes. The drivetrain and battery are built into the downtube, for a slicker appearance, and the Shimano motor provides 85Nm of torque. This is a gravel bike with road bike-style dropdown handlebars, for top flexibility and performance. Range is rated at 160km.

Itiwit is one of Decathlon’s brands. Some sports retailers use these “home” brands to make up discounts that are pure lies. But this one isn’t, and Decathlon’s own-brand gear is typically excellent. So, yeah. If you fancy a kayak down a river, give this one a go. The larger 2/3 seater model is also available for £50 more. It’s super handy to stick in the car, but is no lightweight at 14kg when bone dry.

Vitius is a brand owned by the Wiggle group, which includes Chain Reaction Cycles. This is Vitus’s standard general-use electric bike, which originally retailed for upwards of £2000. While nothing too flash, it has Shimano’s popular E6100 STEPS drivetrain. The rest of the components are from names less familiar to the average cyclist, but it’s the electric parts you’ll want assurance you’ll be able to service years down the line.

Smaller British brands like Alpkit won’t have half-price Cyber Monday deals, but they are well worth supporting. Much of their high-spec kit is made here in the Peak District, they repair, they do social good and they make excellent clobber for the great outdoors. The Pipedream 400 is three-season, down to -6°C. If you’re camping colder, get the four-season Alpkit Pipedream 600 for £250 (£50 off).

Above is the link for the men’s jacket but the women’s Berghaus Nitherdown is also £129 (£61 off). The Nitherdown is a good all-rounder for everything from big outdoor adventures to staying toasty on long dog walks. The insulation is Hydrodown, natural down coated with a clever water repellent so it won’t collapse in on rainy days.

TV Deals

Amazon’s Cyber Monday price for this projector is decent. You get £110 off what you’d pay from some rival retailers. However, it steps up a level when you account for the £200 cashback available from Epson at present. Yes, you’ll have to submit proof of purchase through an online form, but these cashback schemes are not some scam. You end up with a 4K pixel shift projector with good brightness and strong detail for just £580. That’s a win. Black depth is the main weakness of this model compared to, for example, JVC’s D-ILA projectors.

Hisense’s OLED TVs seemed to get wider distribution in the US than in the UK. We’ve always thought that was a shame as while these sets may not always have the picture processing or motion chops of a top-tier Sony or Panasonic, they’re a whole lot cheaper. This 48-inch Hisense is available for £600 from Costco, although you will have to spend £15 to get the annual membership that actually lets you order from the site. According to retailer Very’s website, it once sold this very TV for £1,300. It has two HDMI 2.1 ports (four total) and one supports VRR.

Chinese brand XGIMI has quietly become one of the most trusted names in more lifestyle-leaning projectors. This is a true 4K projector with an LED light source, meaning no more need to replace a lamp after a couple of years. Blacks levels aren’t at the level of a good, more traditional home cinema projector, but it’s easy to use and has an Android interface for on-board apps. This is not a portable projector, though, it needs to be plugged in.

You might cringe at the idea of owning an Amazon TV, but this one offers good mid-range performance. It uses a VA panel, for fairly good contact and blacks, if not at the level of an OLED TV. And, as you might guess, it has the Fire TV interface baked in. The Omni series is much better than Amazon’s basic TV range, as it uses one of Samsung’s QLED panels. There’s even local dimming, a high-end feature, although with 64 zones it’s not the best example of this tech in action. Still, a real bargain. Other sizes available: 50in, 65in, 43in.

If you sign up for Richer Sounds’s VIP club you can get £300 off this TV. It’s a big commitment, though, as it involves filling in a form and paying absolutely nothing. This is LG’s last-generation flagship Gallery Edition OLED TV. It was so far ahead last year that it’s still brighter than the go-to pick from 2023, LG’s C3, with slightly higher brightness. This series does not come with a stand, though, so is best for folks who plan to wall-mount. Such a mount is included.

Before upgrading your TV you should always consider if it’s just a new interface you need. You can blast away creaky menus and fill app gaps with a Chromecast with a Google TV dongle. Unlike the older Chromecast sticks, this one has a full smart TV interface and includes a microphone remote for voice commands. You can even install some games and, for the more tech-savvy, retro game emulators. There’s a cheaper HD version, but it is less powerful and has less RAM.

Cameras and Drones Deals

For years now, Cyber Monday has been among the best times to become a full-frame camera user. That’s what this deal represents, a moderately affordable way to get on that train. The camera itself was released way back in 2014. And while it’s wild we can still partially recommend it, we can only do so for stills shooters. Video taps out at 1080p/60, and the focusing is nowhere near as good as that of a recent camera. Steer clear for action shoots, but this remains a killer model for many forms of photography. This package includes a very solid 28-70mm kit lens that sells on its own for up to £450. If you want the brilliant newer model, the Sony Alpha A7 IV, it’s available with a lens for £2,400 after cashback.

This is GoPro’s latest all-purpose action camera. Oddly, GoPro removed GPS this generation, in order to improve battery life. However, it does have a wireless connection to headphones and mics, has a thread mount, and somewhat improved stabilization. If that doesn’t appeal, you can also pick up the previous-generation Hero 11 Black for £299.

This is Sony’s more affordable mirrorless vlogger camera. It has a mid-size APS-C sensor and a vari-angle screen for easy monitoring even in one-person shooting situations. You’ll be able to get more professional results here than with the average phone, particularly if it’s tooled up with a great lens. This bundle includes the solid 16-50mm kit lens. It’s available without for £100 less, but when this lens can cost up to £280 on its own, the bundle makes sense for newcomers to the Sony system.

Cyber Monday has not brought us many great Fujifilm camera deals, but this medium format package is available at a great price considering the tech inside. The camera looks quite conventional, and the price before the discount was approachable for a camera with such a large sensor. This package includes a lens worth up to £850. When buying at this level you probably know whether you want a 35-70mm or not. A body-only deal is available too. This one comes with a significant caveat: the GFX 50S II has slow autofocus for a camera as recent as this. Cheaper full-frame cameras will feel more responsive as a result.

Gifts and Toys Deals

Too soon? Pandemic is a classic enthusiast board game that has been around for a decade. Handy if you want to kill time at Christmas and are keen to move on from arguing about what Monopoly’s rules actually are. 2-4 players try to stop a disease spreading across the globe. It’s not for young kids but with play time of 45 minutes to an hour, this one does not require the commitment of some board game geek favourites.

Worth buying as a cute Christmas jumper full stop, but a definite draw for Marvel fans. Hit the Merchoid Black Friday clothing page for a range of bargain seasonal sweaters from Marvel, DC and more. There are also a few hoodies. Or roll the dice and for just £17 you can get a random knitted jumper–you pick the size but you don’t know which licensed design you’ll get.

Find a small person (this is aimed at age 5+) and buy them this digital microscope, if only so you get to play with it too. It allows you to examine everyday stuff magnified 200x on screen, so you don’t have to squint down a viewfinder. Plus it comes with ‘smart slides’ that play BBC science videos on screen too. Inspire a young scientist today!

Cyber Monday discounts over at Ray-Ban range from the ordinary to the really quite tempting. The trick is to rifle through the styles to see which gets a 50% discount instead of a 20% one. Default styles don’t have major discounts, but if you’re willing to take one half-step away from the most generic of looks, you can come away with a bargain. Pairs that caught our eye include the Erika Color Mix, the RB2180 and RB4306. Nothing like a catchy name to will your wallet out.

The Silver Sky is John Mayer’s signature series of guitars. It’s really rather good and, as any fan of guitars can tell you, it’s a tweaked take on the Fender Stratocaster. The tone is a little different, the headstock has a 3-a-side design. But it’s still a blues and pop-friendly triple single coil arrangement. Andertons is offering the Dragon Fruit finish for £500, £100 less than other colors. You can see it in action in an old Andertons YouTube video from last year.

Of all the many LEGO discounts to be found this Cyber Monday, this is among the most substantial for an iconic set. Yes, LEGO obsessives, we know this is not the ultimate LEGO Hogwarts, a mammoth 6,020-piece kit you can also snag for around £330 from Argos. But this is within easier reach of Christmas present budgets. It’s a 2,660-piece kit that takes a slightly simplified approach to the classic movie set.

Hot milk frothers started out for cappuccino-making but they quickly became hot chocolate machines. Lean into the trend with this unapologetic Hotel Chocolat kit. It even comes with a selection of posh chocolate flakes. A decadent Christmas gift.

The Line6 HX stomp guitar modeler uses the same tech as Line6’s top-end Helix line-up. That means you get realistic virtual guitar amps and legions of effects, all crammed into a highly portable floor unit. This deal only nets you around £50 off the price seen elsewhere, as these units just aren’t ever that deeply discounted. But GuitarGuitar also bundles a bespoke case worth £40, ideal for band practice sessions or gigs.

One of the best board games ever. This is a bit like Family Fortunes, but the idea is you need to pick the answer that will be most popular with other players. Grab it discounted as a gift or get it yourself, to bring daftness to any family gathering.

If you dream of having a pub in your home, a PerfectDraft machine from Philips gets you there without investing in plumbing. It chills the beer, keeping it fresh, and you don’t need any gas canisters to get a classic pub-style pint. You do end up paying more than you would be buying the same beers from the supermarket, but look beyond the basics to Tiny Rebel and European beers, like the 7.4% Kwak, and it starts to make more sense.

This oversized hoodie has many imitators but nothing beats the original. So get a good deal on this one and your teenager will thank you. OK, they’ll grunt their appreciation. But they will appreciate it and they will live in it for months. Oodies are so warm and snuggly, get one for yourself and it will probably pay for itself in savings on heating bills.

The most iconic LEGO set of the last decade, this take on the Millennium Falcon is made of a daunting 7,541 bricks. It takes an estimated 20-30 hours to build this thing. And despite all that, and the high cost of the set, its enduring popularity has seen this model stick in the range ever since 2017. Be prepared for it to take over your Christmas if you do decide to buy.

The perfect gift to keep small people digitally entertained… and off your phone. It takes 20 MP color photos and HD videos, giving you insight into the way they see things, but the built-in thermal printer uses till rolls for simple, monochrome prints. They’ll enjoy them and get crafty coloring them in and you’ll save a fortune on consumables. For ages 3+.",technology
"Transcript

[Narrator] A slight wiggle in the hips,

shifting weight from one foot to another,

a turn of the head as if hearing a sound.

Subtle gestures taking a puppet from an inanimate object

to an uncannily real character.

That's the daily experience of this man, Barnaby Dixon,

whose creations have been bringing joy

to millions over the last decade.

The main goal is having people,

in a sense, forget the mechanisms

and forget the process that has gone into making it,

so they can just enjoy the motion.

I think the sooner you can get the audience

to forget that you're there,

the better job you're doing.

I remember, at a certain point, sleeping

and I was having a dream that required me to jump

and instead of me jolting myself awake

I remember waking myself up with,

like, twitching my fingers.

[Narrator] It's not just Barnaby's dedication

to his characters that provide their naturalism.

He's a student of anatomy and movement.

Animals move differently from humans,

but in some, kind of, counterintuitive ways

they can move in a very similar way.

It's, kind of, interesting to look at the anatomy,

like the back legs, for example, of a fox.

You know, it looks like their leg is,

kind of, bending backwards.

You would imagine they have a backwards knee,

but, no, that's their ankle.

Sometimes by focusing on the similarities,

you get a, kind of, more innate sense

of how something would move.

So, in fact, only one leg steps at any one time.

There's probably a little bit of overlap,

but that's generally the case.

If you were to add up

how long I spent thinking about how to make puppets

or what I could implement in puppetry design,

we'd be looking at years at this point, maybe. [chuckles]

[Narrator] Each of Barnaby's myriad creations

has their own unique assembly and operation.

This character's called Phil

and he's a fish and he moves pretty nice

in the air, but very, very nice in water, actually.

The water has a certain resistance

and it really pushes against the fin

in a really, really lovely way.

There is also a mouth mechanism on this one,

so I can open up the mouth like that.

And on the other side of the controls

it has a little space for air, so I squeeze that down.

It travels down this tube here

and then out of the puppet's mouth.

I find it's very engaging, especially in the water.

Okay, so here's a little rundown

of the movement that we're getting so far.

These are nice.

These are quite... couldn't really do this

with other humanoid puppets that I've made.

[Narrator] While he didn't start as a puppeteer,

Barnaby's study of movement goes back years.

So up until around 2014, 2015

I was a stop motion animator.

But when the work takes as long as it does

with stop-motion animation

you want a technique that takes less time,

so that you can simply create more content.

And I, kind of, migrated firstly through

some kind of mix of time lapse and stop-motion

and then eventually was able to make my models

and characters move in real time,

and at that point it probably became puppetry.

Can you see these panels, how they change color?

This is actually a reflective material

and I think it works really well.

I've always made my own puppets because, well,

I didn't know how to make conventional puppets simply.

I drew so much from stop-motion animation in terms

of the movement, but also in terms of the fabrication.

So it's very unlike other styles of puppetry.

So this half of the puppet goes on my left hand here

and these two fingers slot in like that.

Then I have this kind of neck piece here,

goes over the top

and then the head on those two middle fingers

and that gives me the range of motion there.

And this hand goes in the bottom half of the puppet.

The index finger goes in like that

and the pinky finger goes in like that.

And then there's magnets in both segments,

so that they can just clip on like that.

This finger mechanism here,

I can control some of the fingers independently,

like the index finger there.

The beak is also controlled by the thumb.

The two middle fingers hold the torso up

and they also control this mechanism in the head

that gives a side to side motion like that.

And my other hand controls the bottom half of the puppet.

So my index finger controls the left leg,

like that, and the pinky finger controls the right leg.

It's very important to get a believable mass.

If the center of mass seems in the wrong place,

then it's instantly readable.

[bouncy upbeat music]

So there's something in puppetry called sympathetic motion.

Essentially anything that moves

on its own without you controlling it.

So all of these dangly elements here

it's good to make use of them.

That's essentially movement that you get for free.

I think the sympathetic movement adds a degree

of believability because it is responding to actual physics.

Now this one here generates the sound,

that is until we press this button.

The sense of physics too, I think has to be hand up

to some degree so it becomes more readable to the audience.

So when the puppet would jump like this, for example,

it's good to, kind of, get an extra wobble

more than it would actually have

if it was an actual living form.

I think when people think about puppetry

they often think of the Muppets or Sesame Street.

Plenty of puppets

in the Jim Henson world don't have feet so much.

I like to get the feet in to show the, kind of,

full body and see what can be done in terms of that.

But in truth, I think what they do is more important.

These are characters that people have fallen in love with

and hopefully at a certain point I'll get my characters

to that stage with regards to the character development too.

But yeah, they've been doing it longer than me, I suppose.

That's my excuse.

This is apple juice. I promise.

Look, I'll even take a sip.

Ready? [slurps]

[Narrator] Among all of his characters,

Barnaby has a special relationship with his first creation.

So this is Dab Chick.

He's, kind of, the mascot of my channel.

He has a really, really lovely head mechanism, actually.

Very, very responsive.

It works with glasses hinges.

So there's a couple going parallel to each other,

it enables a really smooth controlled motion.

The beak mechanism is very similar

in operation to brake cables on bikes.

Around the outside is a silicon tube,

so it enables the flex.

But inside that

there's actually a wound spring that I've wound myself.

Something subtle that I like a lot actually is

the tail moves in a semi sympathetic way.

So there's a hinge there that will have the tail,

kind of, spread backwards and it seems

like he's, kind of, counterbalancing himself.

It's a nice addition, I think,

but a subtle one and very easy to operate.

He's missing a toe currently

and that's due to the plastic degrading.

There's a little crack in his underside too,

for the same reason, plastic's breaking down a little bit.

[Narrator] Luckily for Dab Chick,

Barnaby's experience building his own puppets

also gives him a lot of experience fixing them.

So I've had this version of Dab Chick since 2018

and in that time some of the plastic's degraded.

You can see where I've fixed a little bit there.

But I do want to duplicate certain elements

so that when something more important like the face goes

I'll have the option to swap it out.

So what I'll be using to duplicate the head is this mold.

This was actually cast off the original Dab Chick

from the end of 2014, actually,

so this is fairly ancient.

But what I will do is I will use the same plastic,

heat it up, push it into this mold, pull it out

and hopefully we'll get something that's good to go.

This material, although it is very useful

in lots of ways, you can reheat it.

If something goes wrong, reheat it and remold with it.

It is very hard to work with actually.

It's somewhat rubbery.

So you'll move it in a certain position

and there's a degree of spring back.

If you make it too hot, it can burn you quite horribly too.

So it's not a material that I like, necessarily,

but it is practical in so many other respects

that I found myself using it a lot.

So the name Dab Chick comes from a name that my granddad

would call his grandkids.

So me included.

When I made the bird puppet,

it just, kind of, popped into my head.

I was like, Oh, that's perfect.

Ah, that looks great. Look at that.

And a really nice color too.

Very similar. Or at least similar enough.

So when I design the puppets,

I limit the materials that I use.

This plastic makes up a large part of the build process.

There's some miniature engineering, like silver soldering.

Other than the plastic,

some silicon and some metal elements.

It's really quite limited,

which is quite useful for maintenance reasons

because you can keep just a limited amount

of materials to hand.

[Narrator] Dab Chick may be Barnaby's oldest

and most emblematic creation, but he's always

trying to push the boundaries of what his puppets can do.

So I have this series on my channel

that this puppet hosts.

It's kind of a ghost storytelling series.

The unique feature about this puppet is, I think,

the screen on the face, which is, actually,

my face streamed in real time onto the screen.

So because my mouth is part of the movement,

I move my mouth in a bit more of an exaggerated way

than I would normally move it.

[Narrator] With his puppets fabricated and repaired

as needed Barnaby can dedicate himself to creating stories

and sharing his characters with the world.

I think some days,

especially if I'm working on a big project,

it's quite common for me to put in 16 hours

or something like that.

Essentially, when I wake up to when I go to sleep,

I'm just working on the film the whole time.

I think people are initially drawn to my work

because they haven't seen puppetry like this before.

But I hope, eventually, the takeaway is

that people almost, kind of, forget

that puppetry is involved at all.

And I think when you get to that level

of suspension of disbelief, you've done your job well.

[Narrator] While Barnaby has created his own methods

to inspire wonder through his puppets,

he doesn't feel there's a correct way to approach the craft.

For someone that's getting into puppetry

I would advise them, almost, to not look what's out there,

to try and experiment and figure out

what else could be contributed to the art form.

I almost wouldn't wanna prescribe any rules, you know,

just see what's possible because I think there's a heck

of a lot possible that we've not explored yet.",technology
"Sullivan, a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve, leaned on his status as the Senate’s only serving military officer. He warned that an exodus of military officers was coming if the nominees weren’t confirmed before the end of the year. If that happened, they would have to be renominated.

“One [commanding officer] I know personally told me: ‘I’m apolitical but one group of elected officials always had our backs — Republican senators. Now you guys hate us — the world has been turned upside down,’” Sullivan said, according to remarks obtained by POLITICO.

At that point, it had been more than seven months without a breakthrough despite the opposition of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other senior Republicans to Tuberville’s hardball tactics. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was playing hardball too, refusing to hold individual votes on nominees — until he was forced to — and repeatedly arguing this was a problem for Republicans to fix.

The standoff, which centered on a Defense Department policy to reimburse and provide leave for service members who need to travel to receive abortions, largely ended this week when Tuberville abandoned most of his holds and allowed their immediate confirmations.

This account is based on more than a dozen interviews with senators and aides closely involved in or tracking the dispute.

While Sullivan was among the most visible and forceful of his GOP colleagues, a bloc of Republican senators — including several military veterans — had been actively plotting a way to end the blockade.

Senate Republicans were caught between Tuberville’s hold and a resolution by Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed (D-R.I.) to undo it. The resolution would have allowed all but a few of the stalled military promotions — which Tuberville was holding up in protest of the Pentagon’s abortion travel policy — to be approved in one big bloc. Reed’s measure would need nine or 10 Republicans.

At the Nov. 28 meeting, Sullivan announced he’d back the Democratic-led resolution, urging other Republican colleagues to join him.

“Like being pro-life, this is a core principle that distinguishes Republicans from Democrats,” he told senators. “For that reason, if we’re forced to take this vote on the Reed [resolution], a number of us will feel compelled to support it. My hope is that instead of a vote of nine or 10 of us, that this could be a vote of 30 or 40.”

Tuberville, known throughout his conference as “Coach,” after his college football days, said in response at the conference meeting: “Listen, everyone. I got y’all into this mess. I’m gonna get you out.”

After the meeting, he gave the first public hints that he might relent. Then on Tuesday, he announced he was backing off his hold of nominees for three-star posts and below — the solution Sullivan proposed to him.

Tuberville told reporters he decided to back down when he saw he had no recourse through the annual defense authorization bill, which was in negotiations, and that Democrats had enough Republican votes to pass the Reed resolution.

Sullivan hadn’t acted alone. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican and retired National Guard officer who served in Iraq, was among the senators pressing him privately to find an off-ramp.

“Dan and I had worked with Coach for a very long time — months and months — and we were just racking our brains trying to offer him different off-ramps,” Ernst said in an interview. “We’re all very pro-life. But we just wanted for these [nominations] to move.”

Ernst, who said there was no bad blood between her and Tuberville after the dispute, said she spoke up during weekly GOP lunches “many times” over many months on the holds.

This fall, Sullivan raised the matter at every Republican lunch, to a degree some colleagues, Sullivan admits, thought it was grating or even counterproductive. While he says he never enjoyed putting a colleague on the spot, pointing to the impact on readiness amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s war against Hamas had to be done — and it was working, he argues.

“I think in the fall, when we started to bring it up in the conference, a lot, starting in October, it did raise the issue with a number of senators who were like, ‘whoa,’” Sullivan said in an interview after the hold was lifted. “It was the combo of readiness and the very dangerous world that we’re in right now.”

Plus, there was the role played by Reed and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who crafted the resolution allowing senators to sidestep the regular process, giving Sullivan and others a stick if Tuberville didn’t take their carrot.

Reed, an Army veteran himself, said the dam began to break when five Republicans confronted Tuberville on the Senate floor. All but Utah Sen. Mitt Romney are veterans: Ernst, Sullivan, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who served in the Air Force as a lawyer, and Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who served as a Marine officer.

Tuberville objected to confirmation and blocked each one of them. The pattern repeated itself several weeks later when the Alabama Republican and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) objected into the wee hours of the morning to again prevent the confirmation of promotions.

“I think Sen. Sullivan did a remarkable job of reminding everyone in the [Republican] caucus of their duties to military personnel,” Reed said in an interview. “They’re men and women who risk their lives constantly and they’re not just political chits.”

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who was working to gather Republican supporters for Reed’s resolution, likewise credited that group. Early on, Kelly held several private conversations with Tuberville to explain, from Kelly’s perspective as a 25-year Navy veteran, the damage Tuberville was doing to national security and to the careers and families of service members.

“And that didn’t work,” Kelly said in an interview. “The thing that obviously worked was the political pressure from his own colleagues, just their strategy of putting this pressure on him is what got it done.”

Tuberville talked about that pressure in Senate floor remarks on Wednesday, and indicated repeatedly this week that he had no regrets about his gambit.

“Unfortunately, last month, even some of my Republican colleagues attacked me — and attacked me personally — here on this floor,” he said. “They are currently in the military, and they were standing up for their colleagues, which is fine. But I can stand and we all can stand for the life of the unborn and for our military. You can do both.”

Multiple lawmakers described the months of fierce and emotional internal GOP discussions before the breakthrough, characterizing the dispute as one over strategy rather than disagreement over opposition to the Pentagon abortion policy.

However, senators are wary as to whether Tuberville has set a troubling precedent for other members to hold up nominations without a credible path toward success amid their policy disagreements with any administration.

“There was no endgame. There’s no strategy,” Romney said in an interview. “It was not a plan that thought about how to actually succeed.”",political
"The Colorado case, however, is on the fastest track, and the challengers there may have one of their most favorable venues: All seven justices of the Colorado Supreme Court are Democratic appointees.

During Wednesday’s argument, those justices will face two weighty questions: whether Trump provoked and participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and, if so, whether that act requires his removal from the ballot.

After a week-long trial last month in Denver, the district judge who heard the case on an expedited basis ruled that Trump was a willing instigator of the violence that nearly derailed the transfer of power in 2021. But Judge Sarah Wallace also concluded that Trump could remain on Colorado’s presidential ballot because she found that the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause does not apply to the office of the president.

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said the lower court ruling was “pretty surprising.”

“I think it is important that a court of law has decided that Donald Trump engaged in insurrection,” she told POLITICO. “The court’s decision to say the presidency is excluded from section 3 of the 14th Amendment is the really surprising part. Under that decision, Donald Trump is above the law when it comes to insurrection.”

Now, the Colorado justices have a chance to lend the imprimatur of a state supreme court to the debate. And if they rule against Trump, they will trigger a rush to the U.S. Supreme Court, which would be called upon to resolve Trump’s eligibility nationwide.

“I think once that happens, the court will seriously consider getting involved,” said Richard Hasen, an expert in election law who teaches at UCLA Law School.

Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), who appointed five of the seven current justices in his former role as the state’s governor, described the issue as a “test case” for the nation to determine the meaning of 14th Amendment provision. He said in an interview that he worries his state becoming the epicenter of the issue isn’t “in Colorado’s best interest.”

“That being said, we need to figure out what that law means,” he added.

Trump contends that the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6 doesn’t amount to an insurrection at all. He argues that the Colorado challengers seeking to remove him from the ballot — several voters backed by advocacy groups — relied too heavily on the work of the House Jan. 6 select committee and on witness testimony that he argues was subjective.

He also argues that his conduct on Jan. 6 was largely protected by the First Amendment and that he can’t be blamed for the violence that followed his remarks to the crowd.

But Wallace rejected those assertions. “The Court finds that Petitioners have established that Trump engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021 through incitement, and that the First Amendment does not protect Trump’s speech,” she ruled.

The case may turn on historical understandings about the roots of the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause, which passed in the aftermath of the Civil War and was intended to prevent former leaders of the Confederacy from returning to power. The clause has rarely been applied in the modern era, and it has never been applied to a presidential candidate — nor has any former president been accused of aiding an insurrection against his own government.

The Jan. 6 select committee spent a year interviewing hundreds of witnesses in Trump’s orbit, amassing a trove of evidence that has formed the backbone of multiple civil and criminal investigations of Trump’s efforts to subvert the 2020 election. Though the committee’s conclusions were the subjective judgment of its nine members — seven Democrats and two Republicans — the hundreds of witness transcripts and exhibits laid bare an extraordinary effort by Trump to use his office to pressure federal and state officials to prevent Joe Biden from taking office.

That effort culminated with Trump’s incendiary speech to a crowd of supporters on Jan. 6 near the White House, where Trump urged them to “fight like hell” to “stop the steal” and told them to march on the Capitol. Violence was already underway during his speech, and thousands of his supporters began the 1.5-mile march before hearing him implore them to go “peacefully.”

Wallace’s trial featured testimony from the Jan. 6 committee’s chief investigator, Tim Heaphy, who described the panel’s evidence-gathering process. Other witnesses included D.C. Police Officer Daniel Hodges, who was famously assaulted by Jan. 6 rioters while he was wedged in a Capitol doorway; former Trump Pentagon aide Kash Patel; retiring Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.); and several experts in constitutional history and right-wing extremism.

Wallace’s ruling perplexed many legal advocates by concluding that Trump engaged in an insurrection but nevertheless holding that he could remain on the ballot.

Advocacy groups successfully deployed the 14th Amendment to have a local official in New Mexico removed from office last year over his actions related to Jan. 6. A state judge ordered that Couy Griffin, a “Cowboys for Trump” co-founder and then an Otero County commissioner, be removed. That lawsuit was backed by advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is also backing the Colorado case.

Griffin was previously convicted in a federal court for a misdemeanor for entering the grounds of the Capitol on Jan. 6. The state Supreme Court twice turned away his appeal of the 14th amendment ruling.

Activists have pushed election officials across the country to remove Trump from state ballots, but they have largely balked, saying courts — not election officials — should be the ones to make that call. Now, officials across the country are watching the Colorado case for signals on how to proceed in their own states.

Recently, Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade, a Democrat, said she would not remove Trump from the state’s primary ballot last week. Her office — relying on legal advice from the state Department of Justice — noted that state law treats presidential primary elections and the general election differently, and that her decision here does not apply to the November election.

“We recognize that the same question may come up with respect to the general election if Donald Trump is nominated,” Benjamin Gutman, the state’s solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Griffin-Valade. But, he concluded, “we think it would be prudent to defer consideration of the general-election question at present.”

"Stefanik’s questioning of the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and their equivocations over whether calling for the genocide of Jews should be considered bullying and harassment drew an instant backlash.

The hearing also illustrated the increasingly perilous road higher education institutions have been on since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas — and a willingness by members of Congress to step in and address the issue.

Tensions have been heightened on college campuses in the wake of the attacks and subsequent bombardment of Gaza by Israel.

The moment for Stefanik during a congressional hearing also came as Jews in the U.S. have more broadly faced a reported uptick in antisemitic threats and hate crimes. A gunman opened fire near an Albany synagogue on Thursday evening. No one was injured, and a suspect is in custody.

Stefanik, who represents a neighboring district in upstate New York and is familiar with the synagogue, tied the shooting to the posture from the university leaders.

“It’s a reminder of all those university presidents who said it takes conduct or action for it to be harassment,” she said. “No, it does not take conduct or action to qualify for harassment or violent behavior.”

In her exchange with Stefanik, Harvard President Gay said whether calling for a genocide is harassment is dependent upon the “context.” Penn President Liz Magill told Stefanik “it’s a context-dependent” situation. MIT President Sally Kornbluth said the speech would have to be “targeted at individuals” to be considered against campus policy.

Major donors have announced plans to withhold contributions to the schools. Gay apologized for her answer to the House committee. Magill is facing calls for her resignation.

Democratic leaders also seized on the answers, with White House officials and others calling them unacceptable.

Stefanik’s questioning of the university presidents has drawn international praise, and even support from some Democrats who have generally disagreed with the conservative lawmaker. David Friedman, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, in a statement to POLITICO called it a “defining moment in the fight against antisemitism.”

“The failure of these academic leaders to fully condemn calls for genocide against the Jewish People exposed, in breathtaking fashion, how universities are failing to educate their students,” he said.

Stefanik, a Harvard alumnus, said “there was a smugness” about the answers. She has called for the university leaders to resign.

“You ask three middle schoolers and put them on a congressional stand, they know how to answer the questions,” she said. “But this warped pseudo-intellectualism from the pinnacle of the ivory tower — Harvard, Penn and MIT — it is atrocious, and it’s a sad reflection of what’s happened in academia.”

Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, believes more information is needed to determine how widespread antisemitism is on campuses in the United States. She wants to review university and colleges’ sources of funding from overseas and called for a deeper look at campuses’ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs.



House Republicans plan to proceed with document requests of universities and colleges to determine the scope of antisemitism in higher education.

“I believe we’re going to find this is ingrained in the universities themselves,” she said.

But Stefanik also believes improvements in education, including the teaching of the Holocaust, are needed for younger Americans.

Concerns over campus bias against Jews also comes as a generational shift among Americans’ views toward Israel has been seen in public polling.

A gap between older and younger voters in the U.S. over the issue has widened in recent weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll in November found increased sympathy for Palestinians among voters age 18 to 34, growing from 26 percent to 52 percent in just a month.

Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, believes university presidents “have not met the moment” in addressing antisemitism at their institutions.

A more productive approach could include directing more money and resources to the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education to investigate hate and bias incidents at colleges and universities, she said.

“That is a place where members of Congress, including senior Republican leaders, can have a huge impact,” she said.",political
"Former president Donald Trump seized on an apparent blunder by Casey DeSantis, accusing Florida’s first lady of attempting to “commit organized voter fraud” with her invitation to out-of-state voters to participate in next month’s Iowa caucuses.

Appearing on Fox News on Friday along side her husband, Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, Casey DeSantis claimed that “you do not have to be a resident of Iowa to be able to participate in the caucus.” She encouraged “moms and grandmoms to come, from wherever it might be — North Carolina, South Carolina — and to descend upon the state of Iowa to be a part of the caucus.”

Those remarks seemingly prompted the Iowa Republican Party to post online that “you must be a legal resident of Iowa and the precinct you live in and bring photo ID with you to participate in the #iacaucus!” In her own social media post later Friday, Casey DeSantis noted the residency requirement for caucus-goers but added that “there is a way for others to participate,” calling on her husband’s supporters to volunteer in Iowa.",political
"YouTube has introduced a new moderation tool for creators that allows them to pause comments, preventing any new comments from being added to videos while preserving those that have already been posted. In a blog post published on Thursday, YouTube said the feature enables creators to “take a break from managing comments if they become overwhelming” and provides some flexibility over how comments are managed.

Before this update, YouTube creators only had two options for moderating what would otherwise be a complete commenting free-for-all: either hold comments for manual review before publishing them, or completely disable all comments on a video. YouTube says the Pause feature is rolling out now — we’ve asked the company for clarification on global availability and will update this story if we hear back.

YouTube’s existing comment moderation tools haved been renamed to make them easier to understand.

As part of its announcement, YouTube also renamed some of its existing moderation settings for easier comprehension. This means instead of being presented with options to “Hold potentially inappropriate comments for review” and toggle to “Increase strictness” — which is a lot to cram into any options menu — users will instead be given a simple choice between On, Pause, or Off. Enabling comments also toggles some optional moderation levels to choose from: None (completely unmoderated), Basic (which holds “potentially inappropriate” comments for review), Strict (which holds a broader range of comments for review), and Hold All.",technology
"The presidents of Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania testified before a House committee on Tuesday about the state of antisemitism on their campuses. It did not go well for them.

Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, asked the presidents whether “calling for the genocide of Jews” violated the schools’ codes of conduct or constituted “bullying or harassment.” None of them could answer with a yes. M.I.T.’s Sally Kornbluth said it could be, “if targeted at individuals, not making public statements.” Penn’s Elizabeth Magill called it “a context-dependent decision.” Harvard’s Claudine Gay agreed with Magill and added that it depended on whether “it crosses into conduct.”

By the next day, those answers were drawing rebukes not only from Republicans and wealthy donors like Bill Ackman and Marc Rowan, but also from prominent Democrats. The Harvard law professor emeritus Laurence Tribe reproached Gay for “hesitant, formulaic and bizarrely evasive answers.” Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who is a nonvoting board member at Penn, called Magill’s answer “unacceptable.” The White House also weighed in: “It’s unbelievable that this needs to be said,” a spokesman, Andrew Bates, said. “Calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country.”

I have some sympathy for the three presidents following their stumbling performance. None have been in their jobs for long. They all expressed abhorrence for antisemitism during more than three hours of testimony. And they are clearly struggling with how to balance respect for free expression on campus with opposition to hate speech. When Magill later posted a video trying to clarify her remarks, she had the broken look of someone who thought she was about to be sacked.",political
"The U.N. and aid agencies have long pressed Israel to open Kerem Shalom, but the simultaneous U.S. effort behind closed doors had not been reported.

The only current operational throughway into Gaza is at Rafah on the Egyptian border, but that route isn’t equipped to handle a large influx of vehicles delivering aid. Kerem Shalom, situated at the intersection of Gaza, Egypt and Israel, is far more suitable to let in hundreds of aid trucks per day, the officials and humanitarian groups say. Among other things, it is equipped with robust inspection capabilities to ensure that only humanitarian assistance gets through.

But Israel is resisting American pleas on military and political grounds, the latest in a series of pushbacks that has occasionally put Washington and Tel Aviv at odds on the conduct of the war, particularly how much to prioritize civilian harm reduction. The rebuff on Kerem Shalom has made it nearly impossible for humanitarian groups operating inside Gaza to distribute much-needed medical and food supplies. Many of those organizations have amassed aid on the Egyptian side of the border at Rafah in trucks that are stuck waiting in long lines to cross.

Samantha Power, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, visited al-Arish, Egypt — a large humanitarian hub that collects and ships aid to Palestinians — this week and said that only a third of the provisions put up by the United Nations have reached Gaza.

COGAT, the Israeli government’s office responsible for helping coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, has publicly blamed the U.N. for failing to do more to streamline the trucks stuck on the Egyptian side of the border.

International aid organizations have pushed back on the assertion that the U.N. is failing to keep up with demand.

“The idea that somehow the U.N. is responsible for failing to get aid into Gaza is ridiculous,” a leader of an international aid group that operates in Gaza said. “Israel is just refusing to let many of these trucks in.” The leader was granted anonymity because they are actively trying to get supplies to the organization’s staff on the ground.

Humanitarian groups want to see Kerem Shalom opened but insist it would still be nowhere near enough to help Palestinians in Gaza. “Even an uptick in aid flows won’t do much while Gaza remains under Israeli siege and bombardment,” said Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s associate director of peace and security. “Under current conditions, real aid delivery is a pipe dream.”

Israeli officials fear that a line of trucks entering Gaza from Israel would make them irresistible targets for Hamas. Palestinian terrorists drove three explosive-laden vehicles into the checkpoint in 2008, wounding 13 Israeli soldiers. Four years later, masked gunmen entered about a half mile into Israel through Kerem Shalom after killing 15 Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula.

Alleviating the pain of Palestinians would not be particularly popular in Israel, especially among some families of hostages still held by militants in the enclave. “The Israeli government has made a political decision, which I do not see any sign of changing so long as hostages are held by Hamas, of closing Kerem Shalom to movement of goods from Israeli territory directly into Gaza,” a senior administration official told reporters in November.

Israeli officials shared these concerns with their American counterparts in discussions since the war began on Oct. 7. Spokespeople for the Israeli government and military didn’t respond on record to requests for comment.

The U.N. has assessed that around 1.9 million people inside Gaza are displaced with 60 percent of the enclave’s housing units destroyed or damaged. There is no access to clean water in Gaza’s north and the average wait time to receive half the normal bread portion is four to six hours. Only 18 hospitals out of the territory’s 36 are functional.

The Biden administration has stepped up its public calls for Israel to prioritize civilian harm reduction as it forcefully retaliates against Hamas for its attack that killed 1,200 people. Israel’s military campaign, which the Hamas-led Gaza health ministry says has killed more than 16,000 people, has spread to the whole of the enclave.

There’s fear among U.S. officials that the resumption and widening of fighting following a weeklong cease-fire will only exacerbate the desperate situation inside Gaza.

“The United States is determined to maintain the baseline achieved during the pause and expand the flow of humanitarian assistance to significantly increase the amount of humanitarian assistance,” said the second U.S. official. “We are engaged daily with the Egyptians, Israelis and others to ensure that this can happen on a continuous and ongoing basis.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who has commanded troops in the Middle East, told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum over the weekend that “in this kind of a fight, the center of gravity is the civilian population. And if you drive them into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”

"Margrethe Vestager's Friday message thanked ""all of those who have reached out with support to me to reform the bank and make it more strategic, faster and more relevant."" | Ole Jensen/Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

BRUSSELS — Whether it's the European Commission or the European Investment Bank, ""President Margrethe Vestager"" just hasn't happened.

The feisty Dane is a Eurocrat superstar in charge of powerful digital and antitrust portfolios who has squeezed billions of euros in antitrust penalties out of Google. But she failed to get the political consensus she needed from European Union governments to nab the top job at the EU's state-backed lender, losing out to Spain's Nadia Calviño.

""I will resume my duties at the European Commission,"" Vestager said on X, saying she had withdrawn after ministers finally agreed on Calviño.

Vestager now has very little to lose and a lot she could do to make the rest of her term count.

""She has another 11 months; it is very short,"" said Antoine Winckler, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. ""She has a lot of very important state aid cases ... merger control, the Alitalia thing.""

For digital and competition followers, Vestager has been missed. She went on leave just days before the Commission rolled out its hit list of Big Tech gatekeepers as part of the Digital Markets Act, legislation she fostered to help enforcers clamp down on bad behavior that antitrust cases had failed to fully constrain.

That effectively handed a large part of the EU's digital leadership to Thierry Breton, a Frenchman who has styled himself as the bloc's digital enforcer and squared off against Elon Musk's X for disseminating disinformation.

German socialist lawmaker René Repasi expects dissension between Vestager and internal market chief Thierry Breton also “will be back on the agenda when we look at state aid.” He also sees a potential row ahead over France's desire to do more to subsidize nuclear energy.

French friction

France was once Vestager's biggest fan. French President Emmanuel Macron backed her in 2019 as the centrist Renew party's candidate to head the Commission. There again, she was pipped to the post as leaders then dodged party candidates to choose Ursula von der Leyen, with Macron's support.

But the French love of government playing a strong role in the economy has frequently led to a testy relationship with the Commission's competition enforcers. Not least in recent years as Vestager clashed with Finance Minster Bruno Le Maire over a French-sponsored train deal and then had to bow to a call to open up more energy subsidies.

This summer saw French politicians take to social media to fume over Vestager's choice of an American for a top EU post. The American, a respected economist, pulled out.

Vestager was mindful of tiptoeing around the French, pitching her EIB job bid as a voice for the EU's smaller nations even as was cautious about a French push to fund defense and nuclear investments. She tried to win over France and Le Maire, and even made a play for local tech entrepreneurs by showing up at a Paris digital day.

But any top EU job needs backing from the big two, both France and Germany, and Germany's Scholz came out early for Calviño.

Vestager's Friday message thanked ""all of those who have reached out with support to me to reform the bank and make it more strategic, faster and more relevant."" She also thanked the Danish government for putting her forward after some grumbling that she had been absent for three months as Denmark's commissioner.

Losing out on the EIB ends a campaign that started in June when she said she was planning to run. She took unpaid leave from her post as the Commission's executive vice president for a digital age and competition commissioner in September to hit the campaign trail, handing over her digital file to Věra Jourová and her competition post to Didier Reynders.

She comes back to a depleted Commission as other top officials — Frans Timmermans, Mariya Gabriel and Jutta Urpilainen — have already jumped ship for other jobs or campaigns and the Brussels lawmaking machine will seriously slow down next spring as the European Parliament readies for elections.

A new competition landscape

Returning to the Berlaymont could see Vestager face some tough battles ahead, both with an increasingly powerful Breton and with Big Tech firms and how they comply with new digital rules. Apple, Meta Platforms and TikTok are all challenging EU decisions under its new Digital Markets Act, which sets tight regulatory curbs from March.

Already facing a slew of court defeats over her battle against big business's sweetheart tax deals, Vestager would be sitting at the Berlaymont to hear if the EU's top court will back her next week on a tax state aid case for Amazon and next year for a landmark €13 billion back-tax order for Apple. Rulings on Google's appeals against two massive fines are also pending.

But there is some meat for an antitrust warrior to get her teeth into in the coming months. The Commission is in the final stages of a probe into music-streaming service Spotify's complaint against Apple's app store rules that could end with a fine — or more crucially an order for Apple to make changes app developers have been crying out for.

And there's a high-profile investigation into Google's advertising technology business where Vestager touted a potential break-up, which would be the strongest move yet in a regulatory war against Big Tech. After criticism that €8 billion in EU fines haven't forced Google to make the changes smaller services wanted, Vestager could yet push her antitrust legacy into new territory.

“She can try to finalize as many cases as possible, and if she has the opportunity, she will wrap up the Google case,” said Cecilio Madero Villarejo, a former Commission antitrust official now working as a consultant for APCO Worldwide.

“She can take care of her legacy. I think this can be one of the main reasons to come back,” he said.

"AMD has unveiled its latest accelerated processing unit (APU) built on the Zen 4 architecture in the form of the MI300A – which is expected to give Nvidia a run for its money as organizations flock to buy up components to power AI workloads.

The unit – the first APU for data centers, AI, and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads – comprises 24 threaded CPU cores alongside 228 CDNA 3 compute units that make up the GPU element.

The APU comes alongside unified 128GB high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in the form of eight stacks of HBM3, across both CPU and GPU, unlike the third generation of the APU, which featured dedicated memory units for each. Its components are also included in an interesting design that combines 13 chiplets in a 3.5D packaging method. It's also the largest chip AMD has ever made, with 153 billion transistors. It also has a central 256MB Infinity Cache that maximizes the bandwidth and latency for data that flows through the chip.

Stealing the crown from Nvidia

AMD launched its new chip alongside the MI300X AI accelerator, which features eight stacks of HBM3 memory alongside eight 5nm CDNA 3 GPU chiplets, hoping to match or even overtake one of the best GPUs ever made. This makes up the MI300 series.

With the Instinct MI300A, however, AMD hopes its accelerator kicks Nvidia's feel of in-demand chips off their pedestal, including the H100 GPU as well as the GH200 chip.

Test results from AMD show up to twice as high theoretical peak HPC performance versus the H100 SMX – four times the performance vs the H100 in some workloads – twice as high peak performance per watt versus the GH200 – as well as AI performance that's on par or just shy of what Nvidia's H100 can achieve.

AMD's partners so far include HPE, Eviden Gigabyte, and Supermicro, but one of the most exciting propositions for the firm's latest HPC chip is its inclusion in the El Capitan supercomputer.

This is expected to be the world's first two-exaflop supercomputer when it gets up and running by next year.

Hi, my name is Amit Sahai,

and I'm a Professor of computer science

at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering.

Today, I've been asked to explain zero-knowledge proofs

in five levels of increasing complexity.

A zero-knowledge proof is a way for a prover to

convince a verifier that some statement is true,

and yet reveal no additional information

beyond the fact that the statement is true.

Zero-knowledge proofs are being used in

blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

So cryptographers are excited about zero-knowledge

because of its amazing mathematical properties.

But also because of its incredible applicability

to so many different scenarios.

[upbeat playful music]

What's your favorite subject?

I'd say math.

Some of the small problems

can actually be really big and complicated.

It's like a puzzle.

I love math for the same reason.

Today, I'm gonna tell you about a thing called

zero-knowledge proof.

So in a zero-knowledge proof, there are two people.

There's a prover and a verifier.

And I wanna prove that something is true to you.

But the weird thing is, I wanna prove to you that it's true

without telling you any reasons why.

I remember when I first heard about it,

I was like, wait, what?

How can that possibly be?

Right? - Yeah.

So what do you see in this photo?

[Chelsea] A lot of penguins.

Yeah. Hidden along all these penguins is a puffin.

Do you wanna try to look for it? Do you see where it is?

Hmm.

I know where it is, but I don't wanna tell you.

Do you believe me?

You're not sure to believe me. Right?

Yeah.

But what if I could prove to you

that I know where the puffin is

without revealing to you where it is?

Let me show you.

I took that photo that we showed you.

And I put it behind this poster here.

Why don't you go take a look through that hole?

I see the puffin.

So when you look at this board,

we don't know where the photo was, right?

Was the photo like with the corner here?

In which case the puffin would be all the way at this side.

Or was the photo with the corner here?

In which case the puffin would be on the other side.

So this is a really simple example

of a zero-knowledge proof.

I convinced you that I knew where the puffin was,

but you didn't learn anything else.

Why do you study zero-knowledge proof?

When I first learned about them,

I just thought they were so cool.

But it turns out they're also really useful,

not just for finding like, puffins.

If you just type in your password

and the hacker hacks into the computer,

they can just get your password.

Right? - Yeah.

What if instead, we could somehow use

a zero-knowledge proof to log in.

You would just be able to prove that,

hey, I'm Chelsea, without revealing anything to them.

If you could do that, then it would be amazing, right?

Yeah.

Because then even if the hacker hacked into the computer,

he wouldn't learn anything.

Because even the computer doesn't learn anything.

So Chelsea, in your own words,

what is a zero-knowledge proof?

Zero-knowledge proof is proof to a statement.

You don't show them why or what.

You just show them a tiny segment.

Or just do some sort of,

weird magic trick [chuckles]

that's not really a magic trick,

and they will be convinced.

And you didn't show them why, or anything like that.

[upbeat playful music]

So have you ever heard the term

zero-knowledge proof before?

I have not. No. - You have not. Right.

It's a way for a prover to convince a verifier

that something is true without revealing

anything about why it's true, which sounds totally bizarre.

Right? - Yeah.

Like how can that possibly be?

What I wanna do is prove to you that I know this combination

without revealing the combination to you.

And what you could do is you could write a little note,

a secret that I definitely wouldn't know.

Fold it up, stick it in here.

And then, if I know the combination,

I should be able to open it and tell you what you wrote.

[paper rasps] All right.

[dial clicking]

[lock clicks]

There we go. [latch clacks]

All right.

So,

My dog is named Doug.

Did you figure out what the combination was?

No.

So nowhere in this interaction,

did you see any information that you didn't already know.

And yet I convinced you that I know the combination.

Right? - Yeah.

So what's the exact purpose of a zero-knowledge proof?

Is it like proving something

but without giving enough information that could

endanger whatever it is that you're proving?

So you're asking like,

why shouldn't I just share my secrets with somebody?

People don't trust each other.

And if I was able to prove that I've

done something correctly to someone

without having to reveal my secrets,

then that person would trust me more.

How does this relate to computer technology?

Like, do you type it into a computer

and somebody else receives it?

Or is it an in-person interaction?

Suppose you wanted to exchange messages

with someone that you knew.

Mm-hmm. - What would you guys do?

You'd probably first get together and like,

figure out some secret code, right?

And then like, write messages to each other in that code.

But what if you've never met the person before?

What if you wanna exchange secret messages with me

and we've never met each other before?

How could we possibly do that?

I have no idea.

It sounds impossible.

Right? - It does.

But it's not.

You wouldn't use like, a physical lock, or a physical box.

We would instead use mathematics

to do these kinds of things.

You could take a message and encrypt it using mathematics.

And then, I could prove to you that I know the key,

I could open it up, and send it back to you.

That way I would be proving to you that I know

the mathematical key to the mathematical lockbox.

So based on what we've discussed today,

in your own words, what is a zero-knowledge proof.

It's like, if you have this really important secret

that you want somebody to know about,

but you don't want to tell them everything.

You can use a zero-knowledge proof to

prove to them that secret, but not give away all of it.

[upbeat playful music]

What are you studying?

I'm a first-year computer science student at USC Viterbi.

I'm interested in all things like,

data and internet and blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Have you ever heard of zero-knowledge proofs?

Only in passing.

So actually, in the blockchain space is

one of the spaces where we are seeing

zero-knowledge proofs being implemented.

And I think it's just the beginning.

Let's talk about zero-knowledge proofs.

At its core, a zero-knowledge proof

is an interaction between two people.

Then I should be able to convince you

that some statement is true,

but you won't have any idea why it's true.

Will I, like, understand that it's true because like,

you know, the operations performed in the proof are like,

of a certain, like, you know,

they have like, certain attributes

that would make them true?

What you're basically asking is, wait, what?

[both laughing] Right? Right.

So this is what makes zero-knowledge proof so fascinating,

and so counter-intuitive.

And I think the best way I can explain it to you

is by means of an example.

But before we do that, I have to decide

what I'm gonna prove to you in a,

with a zero-knowledge proof. - Sounds good.

And the way we're gonna approach this

is through something called NP-completeness.

What an NP-complete problem is,

it's a problem that's really hard to solve.

But if you can solve it,

you can solve any problem

that's in the class NP.

And that includes a vast number of problems.

And what we're gonna do is we're gonna

use an NP-complete problem to actually prove

an incredible variety of statements

through a zero-knowledge proof.

And the specific Np-complete problem

that we're gonna be looking at

is called map three-coloring.

Okay, so here we have a map. Okay.

And these are a bunch of countries.

And we've arranged them so that

no countries that have the same color share a border.

That's what makes a map like this validly colored.

And now you might think, well, why should we care?

It turns out that whether or not a map can be

three-colored in this way

is an example of an NP-complete problem.

And it turns out that, you know,

maybe what you really wanna do,

is you wanna give a zero-knowledge proof

that you have at least 0.3 Bitcoins, right?

[chuckles] That would be cool. - [chuckles] Yeah.

Without revealing what the address is of your account.

It turns out I can take that statement

that I have at least 0.2 Bitcoins,

and convert it into a map of countries.

And that map of countries will be three-colorable like this

only if you have at least 0.2 Bitcoins.

How would we turn something like this

into a zero-knowledge proof?

Of course, the first step is

we have to erase all the colors.

What I've done is I've put a color

inside each of these envelopes.

Now, how do you know that it's a valid coloring?

You don't. Right?

You have to pick any two neighboring countries.

You can pick them however you like. At random.

Can I get these two?

These two? - Yeah.

All right. Sounds good. Right?

Here we have green, right?

And over here, we have blue. Okay.

And as you can see, they're two different colors.

Mm-hmm. - Right?

So you have a little bit of confidence, right,

that I have managed to color this correctly.

but not that much confidence.

'Cause I've only shown you two of the countries.

Yeah. - Right?

So now, of course, one way to get more confidence

is to open up more of them for you,

but that would be revealing information to you.

I don't wanna do that.

So instead, I'm gonna ask you to please turn around.

And now, let's change up these colors.

Can you pick two countries at random

and we'll reveal two of the colors again.

I'll take this one and this one.

Nice.

And that's smart of you to check with

the same one of the ones you already had.

Right? - Mm-hmm.

But as you'll see, now it's not green,

it's blue.

And this one on the other hand,

is green.

Okay.

The colors I showed you last time,

don't work with these new colors, right?

This wouldn't have worked before.

Yeah, because of this one, right?

Exactly. Right.

But it works for this coloring

that I'm showing you right now.

So what we've done is we've made it impossible for you

to put the pieces together.

And if you do this, let's say, a thousand times.

And if I correctly showed you different colors,

each thousand times, you'd be really convinced.

And that's it. That's the entire zero-knowledge proof.

Oh, okay. - Okay?

So is it like, there's no actual, like, explicit,

like, step one, step two,

[Amit] step three. - [Amit] No.

It's just like, a probabilistic proof all.

Yeah, in actual implementations we wouldn't use envelopes.

Yeah. - You would use encryption.

Right.

But it's really, this is the protocol.

So what are the broader implications

of like, zero-knowledge proofs.

Are they supposed to be like, more practical for like,

implementation, and or, are they supposed to like,

structurally prove something?

It's not about making something more efficient.

It's about doing things that we just

didn't know how to do before.

I can actually prove to you without revealing to you

any of my secrets that I use to behave honestly.

Right?

I could prove to you that I

signed some encrypted document correctly.

Right?

Without revealing to you what that secret document was.

That ability to change the game.

Like, really just change what we can do

is what zero-knowledge brings to the table.

Where do you think we could build like, more trust

using like, zero-knowledge proofs?

Right. - And it's implementations?

One great example is like in elections.

If you could prove that an election was correctly conducted.

That every vote was counted,

and it all added up to one person winning

with a particular total, in zero-knowledge,

then you don't have to give up

the actual votes of any person.

And yet everyone could see that,

hey, yeah, it was done correctly.

[light airy music]

It's so great to have you here and to talk with you, Eli.

Can you tell me a little bit about your research?

My research is in cryptography.

Specifically, I'm working on some various

multi-party computation protocols.

The one I'm working on right now is

a system for computing aggregate statistics.

So that service providers like, Google Chrome or Tesla,

can collect those statistics

without learning anything about individual user's data.

That's awesome.

I, as a user, don't have to let Firefox know

that my favorite website is mylittlepony.com.

[Amit laughs]

But they can know how many users

go to mylittlepony.com every day.

That's near and dear to my heart.

Multi-party computations.

Obviously, zero-knowledge proofs are about

proving things to another person

without revealing the details of

what it is that you're proving.

But, you know, in my mind, zero-knowledge

actually goes even further beyond that.

It's like this overarching concept

that you can see a lot in multi-party computation,

where you wanna accomplish some sort of task

without revealing anything more than

exactly what you need to accomplish that task.

Right, and it allows you to prove

that you've been behaving honestly,

without revealing any of the secrets involved that you use

to actually behave honestly.

So we of course know that

zero-knowledge proofs for NP-complete languages

plays such a huge role in cryptography.

I'm curious.

What was your first experience with Np-completeness like?

Yeah, so my first encounter with NP-completeness

was in my very first algorithms class

that I took as an undergraduate.

So that was my first introduction.

Is that an NP-complete language is this

amazing problem that not only tells you about itself,

but solving this problem can actually tell you about

an entire class of really interesting problems.

When you first start to think about proofs

as an interactive game where we're talking to each other,

did that make zero-knowledge possible?

Absolutely.

[Amit] Right. - Yeah.

And the idea that randomness - Yeah.

could be useful for proving something.

Again, seems so counter-intuitive

if we think about this platonic ideal of a proof, right?

There's no randomness, there's no non-determinism

that's present there. - Yeah.

And it has to do with, you know,

this whole idea of flipping a proof on its head.

You know, in an old classical proof,

randomness is specifically against the goal

of what you're trying to do.

Right. - Because you're

trying to make everything obvious,

and you're trying to reveal the flow of information.

Indeed. - But once you

flip that on its head and you're

no longer trying to do that, suddenly

all of the bad properties of randomness become good.

Exactly. Right.

Because random is unpredictable and that's what we want.

Right.

We want that unpredictability around us to be utilized,

to actually hide the information that we wanna hide.

How have you used your knowledge

in the projects that you've worked on?

What are the challenges that you find?

In my experience, usually the hardest part is

figuring out exactly where the best place is to use it.

I've written some papers in the past

that have used zero-knowledge in a more theoretical way.

But when it comes to applications,

some of the most exciting applications that I've seen so far

have been in the blockchain space.

So what are some of the

efficiency bottlenecks that you find?

In terms of efficiency,

one of the coolest things about zero-knowledge proofs

is that there's so many kinds.

Right. - I like to call them flavors.

I think that in general,

when you're using zero-knowledge proofs in application,

the main bottleneck tends to lie on the prover.

Can you take the prover's job

and split it up into lots of parallel computations?

Ooh. That's such a fun question.

It's such a great question.

And yeah, I think we still don't know the answer to that,

as a field.

One of the coolest things I've seen over the past,

you know, three or four years,

when I've been working on this kind of stuff,

is the transition from theoretical to applied.

Right. - And seeing all of these

amazing systems that people have

thought of in the past 30 years,

start to actually get efficient enough to be actually made.

No doubt.

And especially with cloud computing,

exploiting the power of the cloud

to enable zero-knowledge proofs,

and to make use of zero-knowledge proofs,

would be amazing.

Yeah. Absolutely.

And also in the blockchain space, for example,

if you wanna speed up the generation of proofs,

if that could be done in a distributed way,

then that would be great.

One of the hopes that I have is that

the power of multi-party computation

is about bringing people together

who are mutually distrustful.

Yeah. - Right.

So can we take that power that's there in the cryptography,

and use it to somehow help with the

[Eli] tremendous level of mistrust - [Eli] Yeah.

that exists in society right now,

in helping to bring groups of people together?

I think that's one of the reasons that I was so drawn

to multi-party computation in the first place.

In my mind, one of the most important problems in the world

is the fact that so many people don't trust each other.

And to be able to actually use math to create technology

that can allow people to work together

without having to trust each other,

is a really cool and awesome mission, I think.

[light airy music]

Shang-Hua, it's so great to see you again.

I think last time we met was in 2017 or something like that.

I think we Zoomed once during the pandemic,

but it's good to see you in person.

Right. Absolutely. [chuckles]

And actually, in '86 I was taking a crypto class

with Professor Leonard Edelman, the A of RSA.

And he assigned me the paper by

Goldwasser, Micali, and Charlie Rackoff

on zero-knowledge proof.

So that's indeed my first ever presentation,

ever, in this country.

Was about zero-knowledge. That's awesome.

[Shang-Hua] Was about zero-knowledge, yes.

It's such a almost hypnotic concept.

It's also an interesting way

how mathematically to formulate those concepts, right.

For example, we have data.

Then eventually we started from data, like data mining,

you can get the information,

and then you have this word called knowledge.

[Amit] Right - Right.

So knowledge has been long debated, even in philosophy.

What is knowledge? - Indeed.

But here is a very fascinating way

mathematicians or computer scientists

Right. - want to somehow

capture this knowledge.

It didn't say zero-information proof.

[Amit] Right. - So what's your take

on why knowledge is, rather than information,

or zero-data proof.

Clearly, there's data there.

So can't be zero-data.

Absolutely.

I don't think we still have a

completely satisfactory answer to that question.

What was so, such a beautiful insight,

as I'm sure you know,

is that the idea of zero-knowledge

Mm-hmm. - being something

that you can already predict.

Right. - Mm-hmm.

If you can already predict the answer,

then you must not be gaining any knowledge

by that interaction.

This insight of being able to predict the future accurately,

and that being an evidence of a lack of new knowledge,

[Shang-Hua] Mm-hmm. - was such a

beautiful insight, such an amazing insight.

Well there's not zero-information here.

Fundamentally I, clearly from

computing perspective, security perspective,

is how much knowledge you're gaining, I guess.

More than how much information you've gained.

[Amit] Indeed. - And how much data you have.

[Amit] Right. - [Amit] Right.

So that data then immediately imply, a knowledge.

But people can't, sometimes.

Right. Sometimes.

I mean, for example, in medical research,

how amazing would it be, right,

to be able to have a drug, and be able to prove

that my drug works

in this model. - Mm-hmm.

And yet, not have to actually

reveal the structure of the compound.

What, currently, you're saying

it would be the next directions

in this space. - What's the next big things?

Yes. - Yeah.

This concept of zero-knowledge programs

would allow you to carry out

completely arbitrary computations

Mm-hmm. - in a zero-knowledge way,

without any interaction, right.

I can just take the program,

convert it to a zero-knowledge program,

or an obfuscated program,

and then just send it to you. - Mm-hmm.

And then you can run it

and gain the benefit of that computation

without having to talk to me anymore.

That's right.

There's a non-interactive nature.

[Amit] The non-interactive nature.

But there's verifiability in it.

Indeed.

Sometimes when, for example,

when you have multi-protocol exchange

that, you know, just like a random number showed up,

you have to enter the random number.

As authentication, yes. - Authentication, right.

Now clearly I think in block chain,

they also began to incorporate a more

Indeed. - general knowledge of proof

in the ledger.

We're definitely at this moment now,

where zero-knowledge is gonna be used more and more.

There are so many conferences and meetings

that occur in the zero-knowledge space,

where you and I are not invited.

[Shang-Hua laughs] Because it's for

the people who are developing.

You know, the people who are programming,

not us mathematicians.

[Shang-Hua] Yes, yes.

And I think that's a sign.

That's a sign that our baby has grown up and,

[Shang-Hua laughs] you know, it's time

for it to be developed.

I think, profoundly, the students often also ask me,

what are the future direction,

both in terms of crypto, zero-knowledge proof,

in the real world and how mathematical you see in computing.

It's a great question. I wish I could see the future.

I can't actually, but let me try.

The part of that that I'm the most comfortable answering

is of course the mathematical side.

Mm-hmm. - I think that there is,

you know, we've done so much in cryptography

over the last few decades,

but we understand so little.

Mm-hmm - You know,

even today we understand so little.

And I think the most fundamental aspect of that

is understanding hardness.

How do we get hard problems? - Mm-hmm.

How do we actually build mathematically hard problems

so that we can then use them to build efficient

[Shang-Hua] zero-knowledge programs. - [Shang-Hua] Mm-hmm.

And efficient zero-knowledge proofs, right?

I guess also, in quantum computing,

you need even harder problems.

Indeed. Absolutely.

You know, now that we have the

[Shang-Hua] specter of quantum computing - [Shang-Hua] Yes, yes.

coming at us and we all know that

quantum computers can break a lot of

cryptographic systems. - Yes. A profound challenge.

It's a profound challenge.

So can we find new sources of hardness

[Shang-Hua] that are quantum-resistant? - [Shang-Hua] That's right.

That even quantum computers can't break.

And that's something I've been working on

for the last several years.

But I'd be very excited to

see what happens in that space.

But I'm sure they will motivate beautiful mathematics.

Yes, that's right.

You know, one of the great things about the real world

is that people in the real world have demands.

That's right. - And those demands

often sound impossible.

And that's where we come in.

It's our job to make the impossible possible.",technology
"NICOSIA — The EU is missing the point with cycles of diplomacy focused on a federal unification of Cyprus and has to accept a two-state solution on the divided island, Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar says.

“They [the EU] keep doing the same thing, nothing is changing,” Tatar said in an interview with POLITICO in his office in Cyprus’ divided capital. “Federal settlement plans have been discussed for 50 years; nothing has been achieved. The United Nations knows this, Europeans know this, and they come up every six months with the same thing: that you should sit at the table to discuss Cyprus settlement on a federal basis.”

Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south since Turkish forces invaded in 1974, in response to a Greek-backed coup. Ankara does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus, an EU member state that is otherwise recognized internationally as the sole sovereign authority over the whole island. The Turkish Cypriot north is recognized only by Ankara.

Multiple attempts to find a compromise settlement over the years have failed, the last one in 2017 and formal talks have not resumed since.

The Turkish north has toughened its stance since Tatar’s election in 2020. He is a hard-liner insisting on a two-state solution, even as the United Nations continues to push for what is known as “a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation” — in which the two communities would work together to run a unified nation.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at the end of November the EU expects the resumption of Cyprus settlement talks, within the United Nations framework, rejecting Turkey’s push for a two-state solution.

“How can you disrespect me that much and keep insisting that [a federal settlement] is the only way forward? They should be a little bit more in the middle,” Tatar said. “Greek Cypriots can say this, and I respect them, but the EU and the U.N. to come out with such statements, which totally [weigh] on their impartiality? We expect them to be more impartial, they are not, and it hurts me.”

On Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Athens, met with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and attended a High Cooperation Council between Greece and Turkey, signalling a departure from the frosty relations of the previous years.

Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides said any improvement in Greek-Turkish relations could also help in resolving the Cyprus issue, but there was a clear divide between Mitsotakis and Erdoğan on the matter.

“We disagree on the Cyprus issue, for us there is no solution other than the U.N. Security Council resolutions,” Mitsotakis said during the improbably relaxed and amicable joint statements of the two leaders.

Erdoğan sounded more aligned with the reality of the status quo. “Achieving a just, permanent and viable solution to the Cyprus problem based on the realities on the island will benefit the whole region,” he said.

“Obviously, any kind of reconciliation can help and this is something that we welcome,” Tatar said.

But he added: “We live here, we know the problem, we confront each other, and we want any kind of future settlement to be fair, practical, and sustainable. So, it’s up to us to open and pave the way forward.”

One of the main stumbling blocks is whether Turkish troops, whose presence the Republic of Cyprus and Greece oppose, would stay in Northern Cyprus after a possible reunification.

“In the heart, we feel Europeans, yes, but we cannot be parted from Turkey, it’s our motherland,” Tatar said and added the Turkish military presence was the only way Turkish Cypriots could feel secure.

“I only trust Turkey. I don’t want to insult anybody, but my true feeling is that nobody will risk their lives for us.”",political
"Interviews with more than 20 Democratic elected officials and strategists in battleground states, many of whom were granted anonymity to speak freely, reveal concerns that Biden’s comparatively sluggish rate of staffing up will make it more challenging for him to activate key voters, including African-Americans and Latinos. They also said it has left swing states without a clear point of contact in the Biden campaign for organizing travel and resource distribution, while also slowing voter protection plans and delaying other in-state hires.

“They’ve got to build a serious infrastructure in the battleground states, and they don’t have it right now,” said Pete Giangreco, a longtime Democratic strategist who’s worked on multiple presidential campaigns. “You have to build an infrastructure to drive [the] message and deliver votes. It’s not something you do just on paid communications.”

“There’s still time, but time is the one thing you can never get back in a campaign,” Giangreco said.

The worries reflect a larger anxiety that Democratic officials have about the relatively slow ramp-up of the campaign and Biden’s weak polling in these states. But they also point to a more philosophical divide within the party over whether to make early investments in an on-the-ground presence or on ads and online organizing. It’s a debate accelerated in the pandemic era, when in-person campaigning largely halted among Democrats and political operations adapted by developing their tools online.

The Biden campaign argued that Democrats’ fears are overblown and ignore the groundwork already laid by the Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties — entities that aides said are far stronger and better-resourced than in previous cycles.

“We are incredibly well-positioned to win up and down the ballot next year thanks to the president’s work to unite and strengthen the Democratic Party since his first day in office,” Kevin Munoz, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. “Every cycle, anonymous sources and pundits vent to reporters, but make no mistake: this campaign is building strategically and aggressively to earn every vote and to win what will be a competitive election.”

But the Biden campaign has also deliberately taken a different approach than other presidential campaigns. Unlike Obama, who oversaw a weakened DNC in the 2012 election, Biden has built up and leaned heavily on the national party apparatus this year. The campaign prioritized early TV advertising, plowing more than $13 million into ads airing in battleground states, according to ad-tracking firm Ad Impact. That’s an unprecedented sum for a presidential campaign in an off year, as is the spending focused directly on Black and Latino voters, particularly through radio and digital ads.

These moves, which have allowed the campaign to save money, are often missed by fearful Democrats, said Sam Cornale, the DNC’s executive director, who added that the party is trying to “innovate around how campaigns are run” for “the first time in a generation.”

Among those innovations, the DNC is running pilot organizing programs in Wisconsin and Arizona to test ways to reach voters in a post-pandemic cycle. The national party has doubled its staff since 2017, while maintaining a 250,000-person national volunteer program. They’ve also placed communications staffers in the four early Republican primary states and Florida.

“People are presenting this as a choice of — either you’re on the ground, two years out, to do traditional field [organizing], or you’re only going to do digital and paid media campaign,” Cornale said. “We’re saying we’re [going to do] all of it, and we’re going to make it smarter, more efficient and, ultimately, more effective.”

Jim Messina, who managed Obama’s 2012 campaign, said in a statement: “Anyone who mistakes headcount as a stand-in metric for communicating with voters doesn’t know much about the realities of the modern election cycle — or running a campaign built to win in one. Instead of using an outdated model burning through resources this early in the 2024 cycle, Democrats are being smart about when, where and how to invest in a ground game.”

Still, worries in the battleground states persist. More than a dozen Democrats said that the absence of top in-state staff had clogged up the rest of the campaign machinery — slowing down everything from building out a coordinated organizing program with state parties, to planning for voter protection programs, to hiring more staff.

One Democratic strategist in a western state called for more urgency, noting it’s “taking a long time to get things moving, both at [headquarters] and in the battlegrounds.”

“People are waiting for marching orders that have not been handed down yet,” said an Arizona operative.

“They are trying to save money, but what would a state director or deputy state director cost them for an extra three or four months to really get organized?” said a Pennsylvania Democratic strategist, who also added that state directors are better positioned than national staffers to advocate for Biden to travel to specific areas in states that are critical for swing voters.

Others stressed that by waiting to invest in formal campaign infrastructure, the Biden campaign was putting itself behind in engaging Black and Latino voters. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, noted that those communities are more responsive to sustained engagement year-round by campaigns and advocacy groups rather than last-minute outreach.

“They’re looking at it like, ‘we have a year,’” Brown said. “But what they’re underestimating is how much damage is being done now … with massive disinformation campaigns.”

Over the course of the week that POLITICO reported on these concerns, several Democrats said that they detected heightened activity from the campaign to finalize filling slots.

On Thursday, the Biden campaign announced Ed Duggan, the son of Detroit’s mayor and a former adviser to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, as its state director in Michigan, which came as a relief to Democrats in the state. In addition, Democratic officials and strategists in other swing states said that they expect the campaign to announce additional staff in their battlegrounds in the coming weeks.

“For months, there has been a state’s program being built out across departments (as evidenced by our hires this week) and we will share specifics, including names of hires, when we are ready to,” Munoz said in a statement.

In Pennsylvania, the Biden campaign is in the process of identifying key staff. Some people who are being considered for top jobs there include Nikkilia Lu, chief-of-staff at the Labor Department’s Women’s Bureau and Biden’s 2020 Pennsylvania deputy state director; Kellan White, senior adviser for the reelection campaign for Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.); and Kunal Atit, former campaign manager for Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.), said the Democratic sources.

DNC Chair Jaime Harrison met with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Sharif Street on Thursday, according to two people familiar with their plans.

Until those hires are formalized, however, Biden’s campaign will continue to lean on the DNC and state parties.

“Technically there aren’t Biden-Harris staff on the ground in these states yet, but the state parties and DNC infrastructure is there and stronger than 2011,” said Dan Kanninen, a Democratic strategist who served as a regional state director during Obama’s 2012 campaign. “They’re tactically doing the same sort of capacity-building that Obama staff would have been doing in late 2011 or early 2012.”

While that arrangement has stoked panic in places — “they’re being slow everywhere,” said one senior Michigan Democratic elected official — others are urging calm.

Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said that Biden’s off-year strategy of partnering “with state parties rather than to staff up heavily” on the campaign was “working.”

“In just one weekend this fall, a year out, we knocked on the doors and called the phones of 100,000 voters,” Wikler continued. “All of that builds the operation that will be the ground game for Biden [in Wisconsin], while Republicans have nothing like it.”",political
"Transcript

My name is Anne White.

I'm a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT.

And I've been challenged today to explain nuclear fusion

in five levels of increasing difficulty.

Fusion is so exciting because it is extraordinarily

beautiful physics which underpins some of the most

basic processes in our universe.

Nuclear processes has a tremendously

valuable application for humankind,

a virtually limitless, clean, safe,

carbon-free form of energy.

[dramatic music]

What's your name, tell me a little bit about yourself.

I'm Amelia, I'm nine years old.

I'm in third grade, and my favorite subject

at school is definitely science.

So my son is five years old.

And he asked me what kind of science I do.

And I said fusion.

And I said I put a star in a jar.

Does that make sense? No.

[Amy laughs]

That's a good answer.

Because it sounds a little ridiculous, right?

How can we put a star in a jar?

Well, we're not actually gonna put the sun,

which is a star, inside a jar,

but instead we're gonna take the same kind of material

that the sun is made out of, and we're going

to hold it for a really long time

in some kind of container.

So fusion is about bringing things together.

That's what fusing means.

When those fusion reactions occur,

a new particle is created, and energy is also released.

Do you know what an atom is?

No. All right, so an atom

is what everything in our world is made of.

And at the very center of the atom

is what we call a nucleus.

And inside that nucleus is a proton.

We want to take those protons and push them together

to make them combine and release energy, fusion energy,

that we can use to make electricity.

And there's a lot of different energies and forces

that we have to think about.

Have you heard of gravity?

Yes. Yes, okay.

So that is a big important fundamental force.

So another fun force to talk about

that's important for fusion,

you're familiar with electricity?

Yes. Right, and so there's also

electric forces, electrostatic forces,

and you've heard of static electricity.

So now let's see about

static electricity lifting my hair up.

We can move this white strand,

it's like hanging down.

The balloon took on the force from like your hair

and put in here, and I'll just like move it.

There you go, yeah!

And so if we want to take those protons

and push them together to make them combine

and release energy, fusion energy,

that we can use to make electricity,

then we have to actually overcome

that strong electrostatic force that just want

to make those balls bounce off of each other.

There's another force which you might be familiar with,

which is like a magnetic force.

We just learned about that.

Our teacher showed us putting one magnet on,

and then flipping the other one around,

and it made it the top one kind of bounce.

Yeah.

And I was also thinking on how can it do that.

You know, scientists are still studying

exactly how magnetism works, right?

It'll still be there for you to tackle

when you become a scientist.

Have you ever seen one of these games?

Yes. With the iron filing.

So if you take this and you take the magnetic end,

and maybe you can show us what's gonna happen with it.

While you move around those iron filings with the magnet,

you're totally in control of that material.

You're pushing, you're pulling it, you're moving it around.

And so you're using this magnetic force

to also do something useful for you.

Have you learned about the states of matter?

Yes. Tell me about that.

So we were in second grade,

and she put a picture on the board,

three states of matter, she showed us a picture of ice,

a picture of water, and a picture of gas.

Did you learn that there's also a fourth state of matter?

No. When you heat

up a gas, you create a plasma.

A plasma is the fourth state of matter.

The plasma I study is actually invisible.

That's gonna be hard science, you can't see it.

And the plasmas I work with are so hot

that I can't see with my eyes, but it's light

that I can measure it with very, very special instruments.

What kinda instruments?

Because instruments we use play music.

That's a really great point.

How do you keep the invisible plasmas,

because they're invisible?

Do you keep 'em in one spot

so you always know where they are.

Yes, we absolutely do.

We hold it inside the container with the magnetic fields.

So you didn't have to actually touch the iron filings

in the toy to move them around.

You could pass the magnetic field

through the plastic and control them with it.

So it's the same thing.

We don't have to touch this very, very hot plasma

to control it and hold it in place

because we use magnetic fields.

You are so smart.

I'm so glad that science is your favorite subject.

[dramatic music]

What is fusion energy?

The way our sun generates energy is by fusion reactions.

It fuses hydrogen, the lightest element we know about,

into helium, and that gets fused

into heavier and heavier elements.

So here on earth we're going to take

some special kinds of hydrogen, a special flavor

of it if you will, which we call an isotope.

And we're going to combine them to create new particles.

And we can only get that combination of particles

to happen if they are in a plasma.

What's your favorite exhibit at the science museum?

I love the lightning show, I think it's so cool.

You probably have learned in school

about three states of matter. Solid, liquid and gas.

Absolutely, we take the gas,

and we add heat, and we get a plasma.

And a plasma is a state of matter

where you have an ionized gas.

If we break down that gas, if we add enough energy

to ionize it, where you can take the electrons

and the ions and the atom and separate them,

and now there's this soup of charged particles

that are moving around, that's the plasma.

And it is what creates the beautiful light in lightning.

So you've already seen a plasma in fact.

So I'm gonna show you this fun demonstration.

You've probably seen one of these before, right?

That's so cool. Yeah.

So the way this is happening is this glass ball here

is a container for our plasma.

And we've taken most of the air out of the container,

so there's not a lot of particles inside the glass ball,

and very, very low temperature plasma.

So it's continuously ionizing and then recombining,

and becoming neutral again.

And we see those energy transitions as the visible light.

So if we're gonna put this plasma to use

and do something helpful with it,

like maybe make some clean electricity,

we would have to control it.

And another word for controlling it is confining it.

So let me turn this off and set it back down.

You're probably wondering what is this thing on this table?

It's a model of a tokamak, and that's the name of a device

that I work on with the goal of creating clean energy.

Have you played with magnets in school?

Okay. We've learned about how

it has to be a positive and negative charge.

And we've done those things where you can like put 'em

with something in between 'em,

and just move one and the other will always follow.

This is all very important to sort of understand

how we would create a container that would let us hold

a plasma in place and control it.

Have you ever played around with an electromagnet in class?

It's a coil of wire, much like this big

red coil of wire right here.

And when we push an electrical current through this wire,

it creates a magnetic field

that goes around the wire perpendicular.

So if you want to know the direction

of the magnetic field that's being created

by pushing the current through the wire,

put your thumb in the direction of the current

and then curl your fingers like this.

Yeah, and that's the right hand rule.

So if we push the current this way

we're creating a magnetic field

in this perpendicular direction.

So if I drive a current in this red wire like this,

which direction will the magnetic field go?

Yeah, exactly, perpendicular.

And if I drive the current in this green wire,

which direction will it go?

Exactly, yeah, the long way, perpendicular.

Now this is a bit of a trickier one.

The blue wire is gonna act like a transformer action.

And so by changing the current in the blue coil,

we are going to be able to run a current

in this direction around the tokamak.

And now think back to how the wires worked.

If I have a current going like this,

where's the magnetic field? That way.

Exactly, back this way, the short way around the tokamak.

We can now put together the pieces

and understand the three magnetic fields

that we need to confine a plasma in our tokamak.

So our plasma will be inside this vessel

in the shape of a donut.

What could the tokamak be used for in like real life?

I'm so glad you asked.

So what we want to use the tokamak for in real life

is to confine a super hot plasma,

and we're talking a hundred million, 150 million degrees.

Because the plasma is so very hot,

the particles have enough energy

to interact with one another and fuse.

When those fusion reactions occur, we are releasing energy

that's inside the nucleus, and we can harness

that energy to make clean electricity.

[dramatic music]

So what have you heard about fusion already before today?

The impeding joke is that, you know,

we've looked forward to fusion for a long time,

but you're not exactly, you're not in there yet.

But if we do ever get there, it would solve

a lot of our energy problems in a dramatic way.

Do you have any idea about any of the challenges?

Like why has it taken us so long to get to fusion?

Making a star on earth is not easy.

So we are trying to bring a star to earth.

We are not going to be using hydrogen

the way our star in our solar system,

our sun, uses hydrogen to make helium

and generates fusion energy that way.

Instead on earth we're gonna be using

isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium and tritium.

What do you know about charged particles?

If I want to try and push two

positively charged particles together,

two protons together, what do you think is gonna happen?

They repel each other and they don't

like being close together, so they push back by that force.

What we're gonna call the pushback

is a Coulomb interaction, or a Coulomb collision.

So you can sort of imagine if I were to take a deuteron

and a triton, and so those are the positively charged ions

of deuterium and tritium, and I try

and combine them together, those two positively charged

particles just sort of bounce off of each other.

So we have to give them enormous amounts of energy,

and it has to do with getting up to very high temperatures.

So we're talking about over 100 million degrees Celsius.

And we typically put that into a an energy unit

that we use a lot in plasma physics

called an electron vault.

And so we describe being up at 100 million degrees

that we're at sort of 15 kiloelectron volts.

So that's very, very hot temperature.

But the other thing we need is a lot of particles.

That's the density.

We are able to combine a deuteron and a triton

in a fusion reaction at lower temperatures,

at lower energies than other fuel.

And this has to do with some very nice properties

of the deuteron and the triton

that when we get them close enough to one another to fuse,

there's actually a resonance

which is predicted by quantum mechanics,

and that really helps have a little

bump up in the cross section

for the deuterium-tritium fusion reaction.

Compared to just hydrogen. Yes, exactly, exactly.

That little bump up is good for us.

Because it means that we have a higher probability

of getting the deuterium and the tritium to fuse

than otherwise at those manageable temperatures.

And when we say manageable, for fusion scientists, yeah,

50 million, a hundred million, 150 million Celsius.

So the problem you described is that we get

to those high temperatures, we have dense plasma,

but the problem is the hotter the plasma is,

the more likely it is the heat to get sucked out of it by.

Absolutely, yeah, absolutely.

So that the plasma itself is not staying

hot enough for the time we need it to stay.

We've come so far in the study

of magnetically confined plasmas, which is what I work on,

that we sort of tamed all the other types of major

instabilities that would cause loss of the plasma.

So you might be asking yourself what is the energy

that's coming out of the fusion reaction?

So we've got the deuteron and we've got the triton,

and so they combine in a fusion reaction,

and that produces a neutron and a helium nucleus.

But the neutron doesn't have any charge.

Yeah, it comes out. Exactly.

So it comes right out.

And it's the kinetic energy of the neutron.

And we want it to interact with our overall energy system.

And as it interacts with that material,

it heats the material up.

It transfers its kinetic energy to this material.

Take that thermal energy and run a turbine,

run a generator, and convert it into electricity.

So once you get to that stage, it starts to look

a lot like any other thermal power plant.

Whether it's fission or natural gas.

So a fusion plant could basically be the plasma core

coming in, setting it in place,

and driving your thermal system to make electricity.

We often call it an alpha particle.

And that is a charged particle, right.

So it's actually going to stay in the plasma.

It's an energetic particle compared to the fuel.

So it actually is going to give

its kinetic energy back to the fuel via Coulomb collisions.

So now they're good, now we like them.

So you get this kind of self-sustaining cycle.

Yes, you you said exactly the right word, self-sustaining.

[dramatic music]

I am in soft condensed matter physics,

and my research kind of dips into material science,

but I feel like people are always asking me about fusion.

What are they asking you about fusion?

So usually people ask me like,

do you think that we'll ever really replace

all of our other energy sources with fusion?

I think that it actually has a lot of mystery around it,

because the fuel for fusion is a plasma,

and we don't experience plasmas

on earth in our everyday life.

They exist in space, at the event horizon of a black hole,

in the solar wind, in our sun, or very rapid events,

like lightning is also sort of a very weakly ionized plasma.

Even among plasmas there are so many

different kinds of plasmas.

There are low temperature, higher density plasmas.

There are of course the astrophysical plasmas,

and space plasmas, and then there are fusion plasmas.

They are predominantly fully ionized plasmas.

They are also plasmas where we have a certain ability

to basically kick up micro-instabilities.

So they're plasmas which are held in a stable enough state

by strong external magnetic fields

confining the plasma into a donut shape.

And this has a lot of advantages for us,

because charged particles want

to follow the magnetic field lines.

But things start to get really interesting

when we're no longer thinking about

individual particle motions in the plasma.

And instead we start to think about collective effects.

It's never occupied any space in my mind

to think about what happens when you have something

so high temperature and like precisely confined,

and now you have to deal with presumably turbulence.

Plus magnetic fields.

When we start thinking about turbulence in the plasma,

we can no longer even think

about the plasma as a single fluid.

Instead we have to consider electron fluid

and ion fluid separately.

We have to use a full blown kinetic equation

to explain how this state of matter is behaving.

Because we have collisions.

So we have to add collisions back in to understand

and track how all the particles are moving,

and how these collective motions,

this turbulence can get kicked up.

So that's pretty intractable, right.

I mean if people talk about simulating that system

and following those particles, it's probably gonna take

millions and millions of years

on even the fastest supercomputer.

So one really big advance in plasma theory

over the last I'd say three or four decades

has been the development of a gyrokinetic theory

that we use to model the micro-turbulence

in the plasma and get that under control.

And the reason it's so important to get

the turbulence under control and understand

it is because turbulence is the primary heat loss mechanism.

the primary way that heat is transported from hot to cold

across confining field lines

in a magnetic confinement system.

Being able to study it, measure it and predict how

it's going to behave is really one

of the big hurdles to overcome.

Could you say the name of the model again?

Absolutely, so it's a gyrokinetic model.

Gyrokinetic. And we talked about

how challenging it would be to follow every particle

in space and know its position,

and know its velocity at all times.

So what gyrokinetics actually does as a theory

is it takes advantage of the fact that when we drop

a charged particle into a strong external magnetic field,

the Lorentz force bends

that particle's trajectory into a helix.

And so now if we know that wherever the field line is going

that particle is following it in this helical,

in this corkscrew trajectory, we can say aha,

I no longer have to worry about following

that particle's velocity around in a circle,

'cause at every point in time I know it's going in a circle.

So we average that out, we do a gyro average,

because the motion is typically called a gyro frequency.

That's how fast it goes around the field line.

And it has a particular radius of that helix

called the gyro radius, because it's just gyrating.

So what we know from studying the plasma

and making direct measurements of the turbulence

and also what comes from the simulations

is the scale size of the turbulence

is about five to 10 gyro radii.

You said that density and temperature fluctuations

are what drive these these turbulent flows

that end up reducing your heat transport.

Is there anything that can be done to minimize

those density and heat fluctuations,

or is that just like down to the statistics of things?

I love the way you framed it, because originally

like in the '60s and '70s, people did not think

that micro-turbulence would even be a problem.

But as we started to make more and more measurements

and build higher and higher basically performing devices,

we started to see nothing

is matching the expected performance.

And that's because people thought that Coulomb collisions

between the particles, just interactions

of charged particles, would dominate cross-field transport,

right, what happens with turbulence is it in enhances

the transport of particles, because now we're not

just talking about this random walk of collisions,

we're talking about conduction, convection,

eddy, structures, microstructures, flow generation,

very complex soup of activity.

Turbulence for me like really hits

on one of the most beautiful parts about physics.

Like it's so complex.

And that's what makes it like visually beautiful.

That's what makes it mathematically interesting,

and it's also what keeps us so puzzled about it.

Yeah, turbulence is beautiful and so fun to study.

[dramatic music]

I'm a research scientist at MIT,

and I work on computational plasma physics,

basically doing simulations that can accurately

describe what's going on inside these fusion reactors.

Like tokamaks and accelerators,

they have plasmas that are magnetically confined.

So we're trying to predict how the plasma behaves,

so that we can build in the future better reactors.

What's one of the most exciting parts

of your research right now?

Something that we were not able to do until very recently

was actually using first principle simulations

to predict the performance and efficiency of reactors.

The developments in plasma theory

and computation and simulation,

that has been thoroughly validated over the years,

in many experiments, and now we're using those simulations

to inform how to best operate our future reactors.

It's very exciting because so far

we've been getting great results.

It's very, very promising.

Where we're going with a lot of the experiments right now

is trying to produce some maybe outside the box datasets

that we haven't seen before, and then of course ultimately

compare them to the simulations and do a bit

of this validation maybe where we're not just looking

under the lamppost, where we're going

a little bit outside the comfort zone.

That means going from measurements really

sort of more in the middle of the plasma,

at about mid-radius, pushing all the way out to the edge,

where the turbulence starts to become

very different in its nature, it becomes a lot more

electromagnetic, it becomes sometimes larger in scale,

just physical scale size.

And some of the things we're starting to find

was that turbulence features and turbulence characteristics

in the edge of some of these high performance plasmas

don't always behave the way we think they do.

So as we think about pushing our measurements

and our study of the turbulence from the core to the edge,

how does that influence what you're working on now?

So the edge of the plasma gives you the boundary condition

really for the simulations that then we do in the core.

You need to start somewhere determining

what is the temperature very close to the wall,

really, of the machine.

And when when you get that temperature,

then you can actually integrate inwards

with the rest of core model.

It's gonna be very exciting in the next years,

when we can actually make some measurements in those devices

and and compare them to simulations,

so that we can have more trust in the predictions

for the next step for the reactors, the power plants.

Maybe both of us in our own way answer the question

that we always get asked, when is fusion gonna happen?

When are we gonna have fusion electricity on the grids?

It's hard to say when it's gonna arrive.

I think that with the arrival

of private companies and then venture capital,

that is accelerating things a lot.

So I don't think fusion is 30 years away

and it will always be, I don't think that's true anymore.

So you're saying lots of private companies have entered.

And that's injected a lot of private funding,

not just government funding. Yeah.

The nature of private ventures is, you know,

you want to get commercial as soon as possible.

So I think they're accelerating things.

They're actually taking advantages

of discoveries in other fields.

Like in the case of High Field Fusion

with Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy,

those companies, they're using

a high temperature superconductor.

It's an advancement that has come recently

from material science, right.

Or machine learning, artificial intelligence.

Those breakthroughs in other fields

I think can really accelerate fusion.

So I think we're seeing,

the next decades are gonna be very exciting.

We have to the diversify the different research

that we do so that at the end we come

with the most optimum solution for our fusion power plant.

I agree, yeah, I think having multiple stakeholders

who are all driven by different missions

and different purposes working synergistically is exciting.

When I'm asked like, okay, what's the timeline

for fusion and why is now any different

than five years ago or 10 years ago,

why is now that we want for fusion?

My answer is it's finally, for the first time,

all the pieces of the puzzle are here.

We've advanced really the basic physics understanding

so far that we have got the predictive capabilities,

but we also have alignment with policy

and science drivers that we didn't really have before.

That's I think what can get us there.

Maybe a demonstration of net electricity in a decade.

Is that the thing folks are pushing for?

We're pushing for it.

Yeah, there are challenges still to overcome, as you know.

And hopefully we find solutions to those when we have

new experiments and when we actually push forward, yeah.

The potential is huge.

[dramatic music]

Fusion energy research is an extraordinarily

exciting field that is pushing the frontiers

of what we can do experimentally,

as well as what we can do computationally.

Fusion might be closer than we think,

and tremendous advances are being made every day.

BELGRADE — Serbian firebrand President Aleksandar Vučić’s penchant for perpetually calling elections looks liable to come back and bite him, as a united opposition is mounting an unexpectedly stern challenge to his decade-long grip on power in a snap general election on December 17.

Seizing on public outrage over two tragic mass shootings in May — which killed 19 people, including 10 at a Belgrade school — the opposition has pulled together under the banner Serbia Against Violence, claiming Vučić’s administration inspires a culture of brutality propagated in part through divisive television programming and coarse reality shows.

It’s a political groundswell that builds upon festering fears that Vučić is presiding over a glaring decline in the EU candidate country’s democratic standards, press freedoms and the independence of public institutions.

Serbia Against Violence is now polling at about 40 percent, while Vučić’s coalition has around 49 percent support, according to CRTA, an independent election monitor. While that means the president’s allies are still on course to win, they could be badly bruised. Crucially, Belgrade’s coveted mayoral seat in hangs in the balance, with numerous polling agencies forecasting an opposition triumph in the capital.

Victory in Belgrade would hold more than talismanic significance. The opposition built up core support as during activism against illegal construction and in decrying contracts for grandiose projects doled out to Vučić’s cronies in the capital.

“I am confident that the results will show that citizens are fed up with violence, corruption and crime generated by the ruling party,” Dobrica Veselinović of the Green-Left Front, one of parties united in a big-tent opposition coalition, told POLITICO. He added that the opposition had “energized a large number of citizens and encouraged them to become involved” at a higher level than over past years.

Vučić’s go-to strategy for retaining power is continual electioneering, with five elections held since his party’s ascent to government in 2012 — an average of an election every two years. No government has completed a full mandate, and strategically timed elections distract from pressing issues like protests or tensions with Kosovo, leaving opposition parties perennially on the defensive.

Though not a candidate himself in these elections — he comfortably secured his second mandate as president last year — Vučić looms large as he predominantly orchestrates the campaigns for the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), and its electoral list bears his name.

Zeroing in on the country’s democratic failings under Vučić, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Tuesday called for a fair Serbian election in which candidates should all receive equal media access. She also complained that, during the last election, there had been “pressure on voters and abuse of public offices and resources on the part of the government.”

The alpha and the omega

Despite growing frustration with Vučić, he has the persistent electoral advantage of continuing to be seen as the only leader with the credibility to handle the country’s big strategic problems on the international stage. These include relations with Kosovo and maintaining Belgrade’s diplomatic balancing act between Russia and the EU.

Fears over regional instability again peaked in late September when a heavily armed group led by Milan Radoičić, a controversial businessman and Vučić’s hidden hand among Kosovo Serbs, mounted an attack in the north Kosovo village of Banjska, killing an ethnic Albanian policeman.

Navigating Serbia’s relationship with Kosovo, declared independent in 2008 but still unrecognized by Serbia, remains a thorn in the side for every Belgrade politician since Kosovo, formerly a Serbian province, broke away following the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro.

While figures such as Veselinović and other opposition candidates are increasingly household names, they remain largely untested internationally. Over the past decade, Vučić has not only been the sole face of Serbia abroad, but also consistently involved in negotiations with the majority-Albanian government in Kosovo.

“Vučić successfully imposed a narrative that there is no alternative to him on the Serbian political scene when it comes to collaborating with the West — and foreign partners bought it,” explained Srđan Majstorović, chairman of the board for the European Policy Center, a nongovernmental organization.

The West bears part of the blame for that, Majstorović said. “During the regular visits by high-level international representatives and political figures, there was rarely a desire or interest to get to know the opposition — probably so they would not upset Vučić as the alpha and omega of political life in Serbia.”

Vučić’s SNS won the 2012 elections and has held an increasingly firm grip on power ever since. Vučić was also placed at the helm of the EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, a platform for high-level political representatives from the two sides to meet and attempt to iron out disagreements.

Majstorović recalled that in 2008 and 2009, “Representatives from the SNS who later became ministers, ambassadors and presidential advisors were welcome guests at foreign embassies in Belgrade, and were being intentionally socialized as an alternative to the incumbent government.”

EU aspirations

Serbia’s tightrope walk is, if anything, now more difficult than ever: Vučić wants to give Serbians a perspective toward deeper integration with the EU, while simultaneously showing fraternity with Russia and not joining Western sanctions against Moscow.

In contrast to neighboring Balkan nations such as Bosnia, Albania and North Macedonia, the governments of which avidly champion EU integration, the leadership of Serbia — a candidate since 2012 — remains cautious not to appear overly eager to collaborate with Brussels.

Playing into this is a perception that the EU is pressuring Serbia to recognize Kosovo, as well as the sluggish pace of integration into the EU.

Still, Vučić’s party is clear on its ultimate goal regarding EU accession.

“The policy of the Serbian Progressive Party has not changed since its founding. Serbia needs to become a fully fledged member of the European Union,” the current head of SNS, Miloš Vučević, told POLITICO. “We desire membership for the sake of our own citizens and because we believe it is in the country’s best interests,” he said.

“The policy of the Serbian Progressive Party has not changed since its founding. Serbia needs to become a fully fledged member of the European Union,” said Miloš Vučević | Stephanie Lecocq/EFE via EPA

Independent polling over the years has shown that overall public support for joining the 27-nation grouping usually hovers around 40 percent, occasionally flicking up to 60 percent.

“Public opinion polls of sentiments toward the EU are important, but election results are a much better indicator,” Vučević said. “Political options that support Serbia’s membership in the EU won over 80 percent of the votes” last year, he added.

“Does this mean that over 80 percent of Serbs are in favor of membership? Certainly not. But it means that only the Serbian Progressive Party can bring Serbia into the EU,” Vučević concluded.

Peril of overexpectation

In a recent televised debate on the independent N1 channel that included participation from all opposition party representatives — though not the SNS and the Serbian Socialist Party, its coalition partner — all the opposition candidates expressed skepticism toward recent agreements reached in the EU-facilitated dialogue with Kosovo. Candidates focused largely around the same talking point: that Serbia is being forced to act against its own interests when it comes to Kosovo.

This could prove a worrying trend for Western officials, who have already invested a decade in trying to resolve one of the region’s most intractable conflicts.

With a challenging year ahead that includes EU and national elections in Europe, not to mention the United States presidential election, another mandate for the SNS would spare the West from the hassle of starting over in building relationships with a new government in Serbia.

But that would translate into ignoring the plunge in democratic standards in the country. While the situation was far from ideal before 2012, watchdogs ranging from Reporters without Borders to Freedom House have noted a significant dip in freedom of the press, institutional independence and general transparency.

Freedom House classified Serbia as a “partly free” state, with low rankings on civil liberties and political rights. It highlighted the difficulty for independent actors to make inroads in government and the public sphere.

For Majstorović, the opposition faces a predicament similar to the one seen immediately after the Yugoslav wars, when the ousting of strongman Slobodan Milošević left the country in shambles and the West too eager for immediate results.

If the opposition were to win, a new government could face “déjà vu,” Majstorović warned. “The expectations from the West would be too difficult to handle overnight.”

"Acer is perhaps the laptop and PC maker with the most impressive track record when it comes to environmentally-friendly products and initiatives. While an increasing number of companies are highlighting their green credentials, Acer’s claims are authentic – mainly thanks to its excellent Vero series of laptops, which in the past have managed the tricky balancing act of combining a powerful and premium user experience with an ecological, energy-efficient, sensibility.

To coincide with the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, UAE, which is being attended by heads of states and representatives of companies and NGOs from around the world, Acer has been holding its own event to showcase its upcoming Aspire Vero 16 laptop, as well as highlighting its commitments to making both its products, and the company itself, as environmentally friendly as possible.

The environmental impact of the products we use is a growing concern for many people, and, as COP28 is highlighting, there's a growing urgency around efforts to minimize the negative impact many industries are having on the health of the planet.

(Image credit: Future)

However, in a year when the climate crisis has become more apparent, there has also been a big squeeze on the finances and living standards of many people, and that has led to a decline in laptop and PC sales.

When so many people are more concerned about paying bills than buying a new laptop, companies like Acer have a challenging time ahead – especially when balancing the growth of the company with its green commitments. So, what does the future hold? I sat down with Emmanuel Fromont, Acer’s EMEA President to talk about just that.

Has the Vero lineup been a success?

While I’ve admired Acer’s Vero lineup for a while now (many have been considered for our best laptops list), and Acer certainly seems keen on the product, I wanted to know how the company had found the customer response to the products to be.

“In general, it's good,” Fromont told me. “It still represents two to five percent of our sales, so it is a bit of a premium product. But I have to say, in Europe it has done particularly well. I think the UK started a bit later than others, but we’re now seeing big numbers coming from there. In the Nordics, Germany, Vero is doing well, and even in Dubai Mall, you'll see the Vero.”

In a market where few laptop series really stand out for consumers, outside of the likes of the MacBook, Dell XPS 13 and Lenovo ThinkPad, Acer has done a good job of raising awareness of the Vero brand – and a lot of that is down to retailers who see the potential of the product.

""We want Vero to keep being the flagship range – to show how far you can go when designing a green laptop."" Emmanuel Fromont, Acer EMEA President

“Retailers that carry Vero products from the beginning keep it generation after generation, and we never really lose the shelf space,” explains Fromont. ”The message is interesting for the entire supply chain, and retailers are happy to have a greener PC.”

This success, he tells me, allows Acer to now focus on making these laptops more accessible for a wider range of budgets. “Our goal is to make sure the premium for the green features gets lower, and we can make a larger part of our lineup eco-friendly. At the same time, we want Vero to keep being the flagship range – to show how far you can go when designing a green laptop.”

The success of the Vero range is promising, then. But does it signal that there’s been a change in customers’ desire to buy greener products?

“Yeah, and I genuinely believe the message is very clear that consumers need to embrace this, especially with events like COP28,” Fromont says. “It's a way to tell the world it's time to react. Every user needs to be part of the solution. I see more and more, especially the younger generation, being sensitive to the topic.”

However Acer is aware that there are still obstacles that are stopping many people from making the switch. “The less compromise there is on price, performance, and design, the easier it is for consumers to adopt greener products,” Fromont adds.

What sets Acer apart

Of course, with consumers becoming ever more ecologically-conscious, Acer’s rivals are looking to burnish their own green credentials. So, what sets Acer apart when it comes to its ecological promises?

“We've put it in the DNA of the company,” Fromont explains, “making sure our business is green. We started this almost 10 years ago, committing to less waste, less energy use, and relying on more green energy. It's part of our brand differentiation. Many companies are getting greener, but for Acer, we want the brand to be associated with being at the forefront of climate change reduction and the green revolution.”

In addition to consumers being savvier about the ecological impact of the products they buy and the services they use, there's also a growing awareness of ‘greenwashing’, where companies overstate their environmental efforts in a bid to appear greener than they actually are.

""We want Acer to be associated with being at the forefront of climate change reduction and the green revolution.""

I asked Fromont how concerned Acer is about being accused of this. ""We want to avoid being accused of greenwashing, so we communicate the real actions we are taking,"" he told me. ""You can go on our website, or read a sustainability report, to find that out.

""The key is to measure, measure, and show the impact they are making. We commit to carbon neutrality to prove it's not just a marketing message but a real, measurable commitment. I think it's all about measuring and communicating, measuring and communicating. This is the only way you can avoid those accusations.""

On the Acer Inspire Vero 16

The main focus of Acer’s keynote, which was led by CEO Jason Chen, was the upcoming Acer Inspire Vero 16. While more details about the hardware inside the laptop will be revealed in January at the CES 2024 expo (which TechRadar will be attending), Acer was keen to highlight how this model goes even further than previous generations when it comes to being eco-friendly.

“We're pushing the PCR (post-consumer recycled) material level to the highest we can, while also focusing on power management,” Fromont told me.” It comes with new technology, to be announced soon [at CES 2024], a refresh of the latest technology inside, and a push for maximizing the green aspects of the product. We've also worked on supply chain and panel efficiency, making it consume less energy.”

""Collaboration is crucial... It's a joint effort to make the industry greener""

Building an eco-friendly laptop is a task that Acer isn’t undertaking alone. At the keynote event, Chen was joined on stage by Intel’s Gokul Subramaniam and Microsoft’s Shelly Blackburn to highlight how the companies are working together.

“Collaboration is crucial,” explained Fromont. “The notebook supply chain is complex, and having partners like Intel and Microsoft onboard is vital. They focus on AI and technologies that, while demanding, also push towards sustainability. It's a joint effort to make the industry greener.”

The future of laptops

While a lot of the focus at both Acer’s event and COP28 is about the here and now, it’s also important to look to the future. So, I asked Fromont about what he thinks the next five years will look like for laptops.

“AI will change the way users interact with PCs,” he replied. “The input methods of text and voice control will converge with AI, making interactions more natural. Meanwhile, the look and feel of laptops will likely remain similar, focusing on the efficiency of the keyboard and screen. AI will optimize various aspects, including power management, as well as improving parts of the laptop, such as the webcam.”

And will laptop makers continue to step up when it comes to fighting climate change?

“I really do believe so,” says Fromont. “The industry as a whole is recognizing the need to be more virtuous. Government policies and consumer preferences will drive this change. Everyone in the supply chain needs to contribute to making the industry greener. It's not only about doing the right thing but also realizing that it helps business and financial success in the long run.”

We’re all in this together

Finally, I asked Fromont about what he personally, and Acer as a company, hope comes out of COP28.

“We hope it sends a loud message that climate change is a critical issue, and everyone needs to contribute,” he tells me. “Being at COP28 is a way for us to show that we're proud and confident in what we do. It's not about changing the world alone – we’re not saying Acer is going to save you. We’ll do what we can, but we have to have each company doing its part and encouraging others to do the same. The whole world needs to come together for long-term sustainability for all of us – and the planet in general.”

"Apple makes some of the best laptops available today but they can make a serious dent in your bank balance. Fortunately, MacBook deals are fairly regular so you can save a good chunk of money off the price of these premium devices – and we've gathered all the best ones available today right here.

We've seen a lot of strong offers over the last few months as new models have driven down the prices of last-generation devices. The current MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have received good discounts, too, including a few drops to their lowest-ever prices thanks to the Apple student discount and the exclusive additional discounts for My Best Buy members.

If your budget doesn't stretch to one of Apple's premium machines, our hubs dedicated to the latest laptop deals and Chromebook deals are worth a look for a wider variety of cheaper and mid-range options. Or, if you decide you need something more flexible that's still within the Apple ecosystem, you can always take a look at the latest iPad deals.

MacBook deals of the week

MacBook Air 13-inch (M1): was $999.99 now $799.99 at Best Buy

The 2020 Apple MacBook Air with an M1 chip is a little old now but it's still one of the best laptops ever made - and Best Buy now has it for just $50 away from the record low price. Our MacBook Air M1 review awarded the device 4.5 stars out of five, where we particularly praised Apple's premium device for its speed, responsiveness, beautiful design and long-lasting battery life.

MacBook Air 15-inch (M2): was $1,299 now $1,099 at Amazon

It may essentially be just a larger version of the MacBook Air 13-inch, but if that's what you want then that's what you get - and it's now reduced to within $50 of its lowest-ever price at Amazon. Our MacBook Air 15-inch review praised the display, performance, design and speaker array, although we did think the jump in size hurt one of the MacBook Air's key selling points - its portability. Nevertheless, this is still an impressive laptop at a good price following this $200 discount.

MacBook Air deals

It's a fantastic time to shop for a MacBook Air right now. A year on from the launch of the MacBook Air (M2, 2022) and the price of the latest model with the M2 chip continues to fall - often to new record lows.

Meanwhile, the previous MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is regularly available for its lowest price ever after a permanent price cut following the launch of the M2 model.

Even though the up-to-date version does come with a new design and performance upgrades, the last-generation device is still a powerful laptop and can actually be better value for money for most. It is, however, worth the upgrade if the price difference isn't too substantial - say, anything around $200 or less and you should strongly consider the M2 version.

And then there's the new MacBook Air 15-inch to complicated things. Honestly, though, based on our review and hands-on time, it's essentially just a bigger version of the existing model. That definitely harms the device's portability but if you want a more dedicated workstation for home or prefer a larger screen then it's a decent buy - just expect to pay a premium.

Check out today's offers right here or head over to our dedicated MacBook Air deals page for even more info.

As the new MacBook Air has only been available for a short time it comes as no surprise that the laptop has only received small discounts so far. You will probably need to wait until later in the year for events such as Black Friday for a significant price cut. And even then the chances are it will only be a maximum of around $10 / £100.

If you still want to buy one now then you can find today's best prices above. Based on our Apple Macbook Air (M2 2022) review, though, and the current price of the M1 version, you may find a better deal on that older model. You won't compromise too much on performance, too, as it's still capable of handling demanding work.

If you're choosing between the Air and Pro from 2022, though, this MacBook Air M2 could be a smarter buy as it offers better value for money for a similar level of performance.

(Image credit: Apple)

If you're after a performance boost, but still need a lightweight form factor, the MacBook Air M1 will be your best bet. While there's a serious performance boost in this model, you're not paying as much for it as you may think. In fact, we've seen some great MacBook deals over recent months that suggest Apple certainly isn't afraid to discount this model every now and then.

As the new MacBook Air with the latest M2 chip is now available, too, we're on the hunt for any bigger discounts on this model in the months ahead. If you see it available for $799 / £799 or less then know that's a record low price for the laptop and definitely worth buying. In fact, it's a better value-for-money pick for most with almost any discount of $100/£100 or more.

(Image credit: Apple)

Given it only launched very recently, there have been very few deals on the new MacBook Air 15-inch. All we've seen so far are small discounts of around $50 / £50 off the recommended price, so nothing to get truly excited about.

Equally, as we said in our MacBook Air 15-inch review, it's not a must-buy laptop, either. Sure, it has a larger display, but apart from that it's completely identical to the 13-inch version with similar levels of performance thanks to the inclusion of the M2 chip.

MacBook Pro deals

Two brand new models have recently launched: the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) and MacBook Pro 16-inch (2023). Given we are so early into their life cycle following a January release, it's extremely unlikely that there will be any deals at this stage. Still, you can find the latest prices below if there is a surprise price cut.

Elsewhere, if you're more interested in the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) and MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) then reductions on these devices are available. They do seem to vary all the time but the smaller laptop gets the most deals with savings of up to $200 / £150.

The new MacBook Pro 13-inch (2022) still hasn't had a considerable effect on any other models since it launched last year, but deals have been more frequent on the 14-inch and 16-inch versions in recent months.

Nevertheless, we don't see the new 13-inch version as a worthwhile investment. It may have a significant performance boost and excellent battery life, but it's likely overkill for most and doesn't feature a new design. In fact, for most, the MacBook Air M2 (2022) is actually better value for money for a similar level of performance if you've got an eye out for any MacBook Pro deals.

(Image credit: Apple)

The MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) is one of two new laptops that were surprisingly announced by Apple in January. The standout feature is the inclusion of the latest M2 Pro and M2 Max chips that power the device, offering some extremely high levels of performance.

Of course, given this MacBook is so new, it's highly unlikely that we'll see any deals at this early stage. There is the outside chance of a very small discount at retailers such as Amazon or Walmart as we've seen this before for previous models. However, the odds are very low, so expect to pay full price for the next few months if you're interested in one of Apple's newest premium laptops.

Now we've had some proper hands-on time and published our MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) review, we can safely say that this is a solid upgrade over the last generation model. The specification boost is worth the price bump, so creative professionals after a compact and portable workstation will definitely want this on your shopping list.

(Image credit: Apple)

The MacBook Pro 16-inch (2023) is the second of two new laptops that were announced by Apple in January. As with the smaller version, the headline inclusion is the latest M2 Pro and M2 Max chips that power the laptop to give it incredible performance for even the most intensive creative and productivity tasks.

Naturally, given this MacBook has only just been released, there are no deals available so far. We might see some discounts at select retailers in the weeks ahead, but if so, they will likely be very small - perhaps $100 / £100 max. Keep an eye on places such as Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy as these are the place most likely to offer a discount based on previous sales.

It could still be worth the investment at full price, though, if you need a powerful workstation with one of the best displays on a laptop. Those are the features we praised most in our MacBook Pro 16-inch (2023) review. It's also a significant improvement over an Intel-based MacBook, so those looking to upgrade from one of those older devices should find it to be a worthwhile investment.

Apple's latest MacBook Pro 13-inch (2022) featuring the powerful new M2 chip is now available to buy. Prices start at $1,299 / £1,349 for the standard model with a 256GB SSD, so it's clear this is positioned as the manufacturer's most premium ultrabook and discounts are currently nonexistent.

With that in mind, we'd consider the recent MacBook Air with the M2 chip as a better value-for-money option. Sure, the performance increase with the latest device is nice, but it's generally more power than necessary for most.

Meanwhile, the new MacBook Air doesn't fall too far behind in terms of performance and will more than comfortably handle your everyday use as well as more involving tasks. Best of all? It has a fresh design, better battery life and starts at $100 / £100 less.

MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) The number one pick for creative professionals CPU: Apple M1 Pro 8 or 10-core CPU | Graphics: 14 or 16-core GPU | Screen: 14.2-inch, 3,024 x 1,964 Liquid Retina XDR display (mini-LED, 1,000 nits sustained brightness, wide color P3 gamut, ProMotion technology) | Storage: 512GB or 1TB | Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55cm; W x D x H) $1,970.89 at Amazon (14-inch) $1,999 at Apple $2,264.95 at Amazon (14-inch) Excellent performance Stunning screen Impressive battery life Overkill for general users

Creative professionals will find a lot to like with the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021). It's a compact and powerful laptop that comes with a considerable number of ports so you can finally leave all those dongles and hubs in the drawer. With the latest M1 Pro chip at its core, it offers some incredibly fine-tuned performance that takes it leaps and bounds above the competition. The battery life impresses, too, while the screen is one of Apple's best yet - a crisp Liquid Retina XDR display featuring mini-LED technology.

For the general user, this device is probably a touch overkill, both in terms of power and price. Those still looking to jump onto the Apple ecosystem but don't need quite as much performance and features would be better to consider the MacBook Air or even an iPa .

(Image credit: Apple)

MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) Unbeatable levels of performance but at a high price CPU: Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max 10-core CPU | Graphics: 16 or 32-core GPU | Screen: 16.2-inch, 3,456 x 2,234 Liquid Retina XDR display (mini-LED, 1,000 nits sustained brightness, wide color P3 gamut, ProMotion technology) | Storage: 512GB or 1TB | Dimensions: 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68cm); W x D x H) $1,899 at Amazon (512GB) $1,899 at BHPhoto $2,539.98 at Amazon (1TB) Exceptional performance Gorgeous mini-LED display Long battery life Large, expensive and heavy

When it comes to top tier laptops the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021) simply can't be beat right now. Apple's massive redesign of the 2019 MacBook Pro comes with a substantial boost in power with the M1 Pro or M1 Max chip, a stunning mini-LED display and a host of other most-wanted new features.

Those who want a more static workstation will appreciate the jump up to a 16-inch screen, though the 14-inch is a lot better for portability. It's also substantially cheaper, too, so those who don't need all the excessive power and are on a smaller budget will do just as well going for the smaller version.

How to find the best MacBook deals

MacBook deals are fairly regular, but Apple doesn't tend to discount these machines by a whole lot as they are premium devices that are built to last. That means Apple usually waits a long time to slash the price of its older MacBook models following the launch of a new generation. Even still, picking up an older but still capable MacBook is often the way to get the best deal.

As for when is the best time to buy, the good news is that MacBook sales are fairly common around certain times of the year. There are small price cuts every so often and after new releases, but the major discounts are held back until the biggest shopping events of the year such as Black Friday and the back-to-school sales. With that in mind, it's best to keep an eye out for superior MacBook deals in July and November.

Is a MacBook worth it?

Sure, it's a hefty initial investment, but buying a MacBook can be worth it in the long run. Apple's laptops are built with longevity in mind, so they offer excellent value over other devices that you may need to replace every couple of years.

It's also worth checking out the Apple promo codes currently available for other ways to save on your purchase.

Is it worth buying a pre-2020 MacBook?

We'll say it again, MacBooks last. Many 2019 MacBook Pro devices still run incredibly well to this day, though you might struggle to cram the latest MacOS releases onto them. That means it's not worth dismissing these older machines immediately.

However, these older devices don't tend to lose their value, either. That means you can easily spend $1,000 on a MacBook from before 2020 and miss out on the latest processors (including the fantastic M1 and M2 chips), as well as more RAM, faster SSD storage and other useful hardware features.

All things considered, we genuinely think it's best to go for a newer MacBook if you have the option as there has been a considerable jump in power and performance compared to the pre-2020 models. It'll be worth it for the extra cash and you'll future-proof yourself for much longer by taking this approach.

I'm Meg Wilbur, and today I've been challenged

with explaining prosthetic makeup

in 11 levels of increasing complexity.

[spooky electronic music]

Special effects makeup is a really broad umbrella.

There's old age, bald caps, spotty painting, face painting,

all sorts of different things.

I'm defining complexity as flourishes, different textures,

the small minutia details that are often overlooked

or are not easy to replicate.

Level one, temporary tattoo application.

Crafting a demon can be approached

in a lot of different ways.

I have decided to create mine around the idea

of someone going and getting a tattoo

that didn't quite mean what they thought it did,

travels through their bloodstream,

and turns them into a demon.

For this step, we're gonna be using something

called Pros-Aide adhesive.

It's sort of like a liquid bandaid.

It's literally a medical adhesive.

I'm laying down a layer of adhesive

to help the tattoo transfer stick

to the skin just a little bit better.

We are going to put on a layer of Pros-Aide on top of that,

and that's just to seal it into the skin

to really make sure that it's not gonna go anywhere.

That's just another layer of insurance.

And then after we get that layer of Pros-Aide on there,

we're gonna powder it down.

This is gonna help marry it into the skin.

It's also gonna keep the Pros-Aide from being sticky.

And after we get that layer of powder on there,

our final step is to kind of wipe it off,

make sure that it's all matted down, and ready to go.

Level two, multi-brush application.

So for this one, we're going to use a nice red tone

to really express how irritated and angry this tattoo is.

It's starting to get infected,

and the way that we're going to apply it

is using stipple brushes.

Stipple brushes are duo fiber brushes.

You can always identify them.

They have a short section of bristles

and a long section of bristles.

So I like stipple brushes for this in particular,

because they give a almost pointillistic,

just gives you something nice and soft

that you can continue to work with.

So in this level,

we are introducing the use of alcohol paint,

and the reason that I like alcohol paint the most

is because you can use it like a watercolor

It builds up in washes, and it looks really subtle.

If you think about skin as an organ,

it's layered on top of other things,

and alcohol paint has the translucency

to mimic actual things that happen on your skin

without looking as opaque and stagey

as a cream makeup might.

Level three, veining.

We're at the part of the story

where the infection is starting to enter the bloodstream.

So, the brush that I'm gonna be mainly using for this

is a very, very fine point brush.

It's a 6-10.

In order to get the effect of really cool veining,

which is just to show the actual veins

that are capillaries of your arm,

we are going to be using our stippling technique.

It leaves behind these little points every so often,

and I like to use them as the groundwork

for creating really cool veins.

The cool thing about alcohol paint

is that because it is applied in washes

and it is so translucent,

you don't have to be committed to anything.

And because we've stippled paint on

and there are voids in areas where there's not as much paint

or there's no paint at all,

you can get away with doing things like that.

If you oversaturate the skin with alcohol

and attempt to touch paint onto it, it'll bleed.

It'll balloon or blossom.

And another thing to look out for

is you can't use a ton of pressure and drag it across

with multiple colors.

You'll start to pick up the layers underneath.

It is very easily reactivated.

Level four, creating dimension.

So so far, all of our techniques

have been two-dimensional techniques.

For this level, we are adding an additional third dimension

to things, so we can pop out some blisters

and really add to our look by giving it a little hype.

For this level,

we're gonna be using a two-part silicone complex.

They stay totally uncured when they're separate.

When you mix them together,

they cure into little silicone pieces,

and they can go right on the skin.

It's a platinum-based silicone,

and I'm gonna add a catalyst to it

to just make it cure just a little bit faster.

That way we can make sure that our little dots

that we put on the skin stay raised dots.

After we get those dots on the skin

in the areas that we want them,

we're going to add a little bit of alcohol paint

on top of them just to give them a little extra pop

to really show that they are pussy and infected.

I'm gonna be using a filbert brush to go in

and around these little blisters that we've created

to give them a little more dimension.

And I'm going to use a flat-ended brush

to add the yellow color to the blisters.

I am using yellow, because yellow puss,

and I'm going to be using a little more

of that angry red color around the base of those pustules,

so that I can really pop them out

and make sure that they read well.

Next level, I'll be increasing complexity

introducing texture to our look.

Level five, creating texture.

We will be using something called Egyptian Magic.

Egyptian Magic is something that you can use

to add a glossy sheen to your pieces.

Many industry professionals use KY jelly

for almost everything.

And for this, we don't really need it to be goopy or gooey.

We just want it to be very slick and wet-looking.

So I tend to gravitate towards the Egyptian Magic,

because it's easy to apply.

It's shiny without being too shiny.

It's not too wet.

It's not too runny.

You can control it pretty well,

and it really makes things look quite good.

So the way in which we're increasing complexity

is by increasing our visual language.

In order to do that,

we are adding different levels of texture,

different pieces to really make it come together.

If you wanted to make something goopy or gooey

like think about Neo coming out of that pod

for the first time in The Matrix,

that's a substance called methylcellulose,

which is a plant-based food thickener,

totally consumable, totally flavorless,

but it is actually something that you would buy

as a powdered substance and then boil on the stove.

I know, because I've done it

Level six, prosthetic application.

So story-wise, our model is now going fully

off the deep end and becoming a full-on demon.

For the sake of the schedule of our episode,

we've gone ahead

and acquired a pre-made demon face appliance.

In a larger production,

I would prefer to craft my own demon face

to control as much of the creature's design

as I possibly can.

And in order to achieve this look,

we are going to be applying a full face

facial prosthetic appliance, as well as two ear appliances,

one to each ear, and then two sets of horns.

I've asked our model to go ahead

and insert his own contact lenses

prior to our facial transformation

as a safety precaution.

For this level,

I'm gonna have my friend Brittany Turpen help me.

She is going to assist me through the application process,

and in order to make our application

as easy and seamless as possible,

our first step is going to be to prep the skin.

We're gonna use another round of that toner.

This time, we are also going to apply something

known as Skin Saver.

It's a lotion that you put on that acts as a barrier cream.

Your skin on your face is very thin,

much thinner than the skin on your arms

or the skin on your legs.

So we wanna treat it with a little bit more TLC.

Removing a full facial appliance at the end of the day

can be quite a task, and we want to make sure

that he walks away feeling as fresh as a spring chicken.

Our second step is going to be

gluing down our model's eyebrows, which might seem crazy,

but we will be using a silicone-based adhesive

known as Telesis.

The next part of this application

will be holding the facial appliance

up to Andrew and seeing how it fits him.

We're gonna decide on exactly how we want it to be placed,

and then we're gonna take a powder puff

and powder around the edges of it,

so that we know exactly where we want it to lay,

so that when we go to actually glue everything down,

we know exactly how it lines up on his face.

Since we are using generic prosthetics for this,

it is kind of impossible to say

if things will fit him perfectly until we see it near him,

and it's very likely that they won't fit like a glove.

It's very common for there to be minor fit issues,

especially if you don't get a makeup test.

There's a variety of ways that you can handle that.

Sometimes we use things called blenders.

They're little patches of very thin foam latex

that you can just apply to bad, saggy, crazy edges

[chuckles] to make sure that people can't see them.

For this application,

we're going to be using the same silicone glue

that we use to glue down our model's brows

instead of the Pros-Aide that we used for the tattoo.

There is something that goes with it called thinner,

which just kind of thins out the consistency

of that very thick silicone-based glue,

and sometimes instead you can use that thinner

to lift an edge that got pushed down too quickly.

It adds so much more flexibility to your application.

Whereas with Pros-Aid, once it's down, it's down.

That's it, that's all you got, good luck.

For our next level, we'll be increasing complexity

by painting and sealing with pax paint,

which will seal the foam

and also help us start to match our model's skin tone.

Level seven, stippling with pax.

So in this level, we are going to be using something

called pax paint, which is a mixture of Pros-Aide adhesive

and acrylic paint.

The reason that we're going to be using that next

is because we must seal the foam completely

before we can move on to using any of our airbrush

or alcohol colors, because foam is really porous,

and it will absorb anything that's super wet

if you don't seal it first.

So the acrylic and Pros-Aide mixture creates a film,

a plastic film over it that is totally skin-safe.

Acrylic paint is very flexible.

So this mixture of it and the adhesive actually flexes

with you, so you'll still be able to move all around

without it cracking off like you would think

that house paint would, but it also seals it,

so that we can then in our next steps

use our favorite paints to really make things come to life.

In level two, we used alcohol paint

and brushes to do stippling.

In this level, we're going to be using

non-latex white sponge

to create a very similar type of texture,

but we're using sponge, because the pax paint

can easily ruin your brushes,

and those brushes are quite expensive.

So we wanna make sure we take very good care of them.

In order to create that texture with the sponge,

what I do ahead of time is I will take the sponge

and rip it up and then use that

to create this dimensional texture with our pax paint.

The worst mistake you can make

with pax paint is to use way too much of it.

It is a nightmare to remove.

There are instances in which we'll use pax paint

like on hands or for movies where it's a totally blue guy

and you have to do what you have to do,

but it's not preferential to use pax paint anywhere

except for where you absolutely need it.

Level eight, spattering.

While it may seem

like applying the prosthetics is actually more difficult

than what our next step is going to be,

it's something that has to be done

before we can achieve our next level.

I'm going to be using one of my favorite airbrush guns

to help elevate our look of actual skin texture

and actual skin color.

So we will be really trying to nail down that skin tone

and nail down the look of our skin.

We don't really wanna touch it

after this level to adjust the skin.

We're just gonna move on

to other parts of painting after this.

I like to use the spattering gun

to start things off at least.

There are plenty of other spatter.

You can use a a chip brush that you cut off the top.

I like to start with my airbrush,

because it's the most uniform spray

whereas when you're doing something by hand,

it is dependent upon how you are flicking it,

how it's feeling.

Because I'm also trying to nail a color,

I want to make sure that my color is uniform

before I start adding in more unique touches.

The reason that I am going to use the chip brush

near the eye area

is because we want to blend down those edges,

but I know that I'm going to be doing a different

than flesh paint scheme in the eye area ultimately.

So I'm not quite as concerned with the uniformity of that

in the eye area, and I'm going to be using my airbrush gun

for the overall effect on the rest of the prosthetic.

The types of paints that we're gonna be using for this,

not just skin tone paints,

but we are also going to be using color adjusters as well.

Color adjusters that you might come across

even in the makeup store when you go,

you get your corals, you get your rose adjusters,

you've got olive adjuster.

I'm a big fan of adjusters.

I love them.

I feel like they are the easiest way

to make things really start to look real.

You can get caught up in the minutia

of using a bunch of different skin tones,

but at the end of the day,

once you've gotten in the realm of your skin tone,

it will be really be up to the adjusters

to come in and save the day for you.

If your paint is super thin,

you're gonna wind up doing about 7,000 passes

with your airbrush gun

before you finally start to see something happening,

but you don't want your paint to be too pigmented as well,

because then you're just gonna see like freckles everywhere,

just a million freckles of everything,

and that gets to be very overwhelming.

It's a push and pull of, okay,

for this pass, I think I'm gonna do super translucent.

Then maybe the next pass with a different color,

I'm gonna get a little bit bolder with it.

I'm gonna back off with the translucency.

You really learn those things through trial and error.

I try to start pretty loosey goosey with it,

and then once I start feeling like,

okay, we've got our skin tone nailed down,

I'm gonna start adding my freckle tone.

I'm gonna add my dark freckle tone.

I just like to make sure

that I give myself a little bit of wiggle room,

so I'm not like committed to a barrage of dots off the bat.

In our next level, we're going to be increasing complexity

by starting to really hone in on our character.

We're going to be using techniques known as modeling

and patterning to breathe a new life into this character

now that we have already nailed down the fleshiness

and the skin tone of it

and just start to really make our character sing.

Level nine, modeling and patterning.

Modeling is a term that refers to what happens with blood

in the skin of dead bodies,

and it is this very dappled blood pooling that happens.

It is something that we use as a technique

of paint application in the special effects world,

not just when we're simulating zombies or dead bodies,

but also that term has come to transcend

just that application and start to refer

to the look of breaking up the skin

in a way where the paint ebbs and flows

where you get some areas that have this definition

and other areas that don't have it quite as much,

and it's a very gorgeous technique.

Patterning, think of it like a snake.

It's like the actual pattern

of how the paint is going to go on

or how your look is going to wind up.

I am going to achieve our modeling and patterning

through use of a more precise airbrush gun.

This is going to be a smaller spray pattern

and a smaller airbrush gun in general.

And I am going to use modeling techniques.

Some people refer to it as like your crazy eights

or your your eight patterns, my favorite,

and it's one of the easiest to fly through,

but it is really just a way of applying paint

in a non-uniform uniform way to break up the skin.

And I will pattern over that with the same airbrush gun

in a very similar manner to how we did our veining.

I'm gonna follow the lead of my modeling

and see how it turns out and where it goes.

And then I'm gonna go in there and I like to dot

with my patterning, so we're gonna do that.

This is the level and the step in this application

where you can really let your artistry come

to the forefront of things.

In the previous levels, in the previous steps,

we've been just focused on trying to create as much realism

as possible, and this is where fantasy starts to take over.

This is where your ideas and and your beliefs

about how you want your character to turn out,

that's where this can come to the party

and take the lead.

Level 10, dry brushing and marrying.

In level 10, we're increasing our complexity

by using the techniques of dry brushing in particular

and also the idea of marrying all of our things together.

We will be using these to just solidify what we've done

in the previous levels and make sure

that everything comes together to create one very uniform

and very put together piece.

Previously to this, we have ignored the eye orbit a bit,

and we are going to be using cream makeup

to really bring our paint job down into the eye orbit.

We're gonna use a little bit of eyeliner in the eye

to marry our effects paint job and our actual areas

that I wouldn't wanna use alcohol paint, for instance.

I'm not gonna use alcohol pain on somebody's eyelid.

That's a little mean.

I am going to use beauty makeup

in a non-conventional beauty way to bring some more life

into this and to really keep things

in the realm that I wanna keep them in,

which is to move away from human and to move into fantasy.

And I'm going to be using a technique known as dry brushing.

Previous to this,

we've been using wet application techniques

where the paint is very wet as we apply it.

In this in particular with the horns,

we're gonna use a dry brushing technique,

which is where you try to get as much of the water,

whatever you used to activate with off the brush

and keep the pigment on it,

and then brush that onto the horns

to enhance the texture of it,

and then leave some of that paint

that was already on the horn in the areas that you want it.

So really what this does is it adds pigment

to the raised parts of the piece

and leaves what you already had

into the crevices and recesses of it.

Level 11, final reveal.

For the final level,

I am taking a dental impression from my model,

and I am going to create a custom set of dentures for him,

so that we can add something special to this

that is not purchasable in stores

like every other piece that we have done previously.

I'll also be adding nails to the look

and a little bit more flare, a little demon blood,

a little sass there.

And these elements are often overlooked,

but so important to helping tell a story.

They really change the entirety of the makeup.

They really help sell it a little bit more.

And I find them to be

some of the most fascinating parts of makeups.

I mean, think about all those scary things that you've seen

with like creepy teeth all over them.

So like, yeah, we're gonna add a little creepy teeth

to this guy.

[spooky electronic music]

Thanks so much for watching.

I hope you guys learned something new

about prosthetic makeup that you didn't know before,

and hopefully I've piqued your interest enough

to help you win the Halloween costume contest this year

at your job.

Good luck.",technology

"If you have push notifications turned on for sensitive apps, you may want to reconsider your settings.

The United States government and foreign law enforcement can demand Apple and Google share metadata associated with push notifications from apps on iOS and Android, according to a US senator and court records reviewed by WIRED. These notifications can reveal which apps a person uses, along with other information that may be pertinent to law enforcement investigations.

US Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, highlighted the government surveillance technique in a letter sent to the US Department of Justice (DOJ) today. Wyden is specifically asking the DOJ to allow Apple and Google to discuss government requests for push notification records with their users, which Wyden says the US government has required them to keep secret thus far.

“In the spring of 2022, my office received a tip that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone ‘push’ notification records from Google and Apple,” Wyden wrote in the letter, which was first reported by Reuters. “My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government.”

App developers deliver push notifications using Apple’s Push Notification Service on iOS or Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging on Android. Each user of an app is assigned a “push token,” which is transferred between the app and the mobile operating system’s push notification service. Push tokens are not permanently assigned to a single user, and new tokens may be generated when a person reinstalls an app or switches to a new device.

To identify a person of interest and whom they may have been communicating with, law enforcement must first go to an app developer to obtain the relevant push token and then bring it to the operating system maker—Apple or Google—and request information on which account the token is associated with. This puts the tech giants in “a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,” Wyden writes.",technology
"Say goodbye to the Chevy Bolt EV... again.

General Motors won’t be bringing over the original hatchback Bolt to the automaker’s Ultium platform, just the larger Bolt EUV, GM confirmed after InsideEVs first reported the news. That comes after GM said it was discontinuing Bolt production but later confirmed that it would resurrect the EV as an Ultium vehicle for 2025.

The original Bolt EV was built on GM’s older and soon-to-be-obsolete BEV2 platform. The automaker has since shifted to the Ultium battery architecture for its next-generation EVs, including the Cadillac Lyriq, Hummer EV, and GMC Sierra EV. Chevy is building a trio of Ultium-built EVs, including the Silverado EV, Blazer EV, and Equinox EV.

“We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt”

“We are glad to see the enthusiasm surrounding the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt,” Cody Williams, senior manager for communications at Chevy, said in a statement. “We will share details as we get closer to its launch date. As we’ve said before, the new Bolt will build on the formula that has made it a success today.”

Joining them in 2025 will be the Bolt EUV, which is slightly longer and comes with more cargo space than the Bolt EV. The differences are pretty slight: the 2022 Bolt EUV is about nine inches longer than the Bolt EV but basically the same height and width. The Bolt EUV has 97 cubic feet of passenger volume and 16 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, while the Bolt EV has 93.9 cubic feet of passenger space and 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats.

First introduced in 2016, the Chevy Bolt EV was intended to be the automaker’s first stab at a mass-market, battery-electric vehicle with 200-plus miles of range and an affordable price tag. The company released a refreshed model, as well as a slightly larger EUV version, in early 2021.

But thanks to Tesla’s dominance in the EV market, sales of the Bolt EV and EUV were pretty anemic for several years. This year has been one of the Bolt’s best sales years yet, with record sales in the second quarter across multiple markets.",technology
"Phanteks just launched a 5.5-inch LED with an IPS display to be used inside your case. This is an excellent option for those who want to showcase more than just their computer's RGB lighting hardware, liquid cooling setups, and fancy cables to make your edge-to-edge fish tank-looking glass PC cases look less boring while complimenting its aesthetics.

These have a 2160 x 1,440 resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate, 450 nits brightness, and 99% sRGB color profiles. The casing is plastic with two color options and is lightweight (Phanteks only lists the gross weight, so it should be much less than 337.5 grams).

What Makes This More User-Friendly Than Any Mini Displays

Many PC enthusiasts have been incorporating mini displays inside their PC cases to display a particular video or as a system health monitor, even before all glass panel chassis were a thing. Their multiple mounting options with two viewing angles and DC power input make these mini displays more convenient for this purpose.

The monitor has magnets placed within the monitor's casing, allowing you to have an almost flush mount on any steel surface (like the PSU Shroud). But the screw-mount feet allow more freedom. It provides a 90-degree or 15-degree tilt, and it is also magnetic. Additionally, because of the mounting holes on the display and the in-display magnets, you can display it horizontally or vertically. If this doesn't satisfy you, the feet provide screw holes, letting you attach this monitor to a 120mm fan from within. The mounting method is limited to horizontal orientation when mounted on top/ bottom mounted fans and the vertical layout when mounted from within the front and rear case fans.

Since it uses a 5v mini USB connector for power, it provides cleaner cable management than typical mini displays with a power brick powered by a wall socket. A SATA or Micro-USB cable lets your system's PSU power up this display internally. All the adequately sized wires are provided, though you'd need to buy longer cables should you use this as an external monitor away from the case.

Phantek's purpose-made LED has a recessed cable management area for the HDMI and a SATA-to-mini USB connector. The monitor's OSD lets you change the display orientation, set resolution, set the display to extend, hide the taskbar, and prevent cursor display on this screen, something you wouldn't find in typical mini displays.

Phanteks provides all the needed screws, HDMI cable, and a SATA-to-mini-USB cable, giving you a complete package. With a two-year warranty and the option to choose in white or black casing, you get everything you need to have a mini display inside your PC case. Pre-orders can be placed on Phantek's website, which sells these for $109 each. But once this is available, we may see these listed on Amazon and other online retailers.",technology
"Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt are effectively sealed, leaving 2.3 million Palestinians with no option other than to seek refuge within the territory 25 miles long by about 7 miles wide.

A day after Israel confirmed it was rounding up Palestinian men for interrogation, some told The Associated Press they had been badly treated.

Osama Oula, one of a group of 10 boys and men dropped off at a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah after being freed, said Israeli forces bound him and others with zip ties, beat them for several days and gave them little water to drink. Some were not allowed out to use the toilet. Once freed, barefoot and in their underwear, they were told to walk south, he said.

Another man, Ahmad Nimr Salman, showed his marked and swollen hands from the zip ties. He said his 17-year-old son, Amjad, was still held. “They used to ask us, ‘Are you with Hamas?’ We say ‘no,’ then they would slap us or kick us,” he said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment when asked about the alleged abuse.

With the war now in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,700, the majority women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.

Two hospitals in central and southern Gaza received the bodies of 133 people from Israeli bombings over the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry said midday Saturday.

Israel holds the Hamas militants responsible for civilian casualties, accusing them of using civilians as human shields, and says it has made considerable efforts with evacuation orders to get civilians out of harm’s way. It says 97 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive after Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 raid in Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 240 hostages were taken.

Hamas said Saturday that it continued its rocket fire into Israel.

In Gaza, residents reported airstrikes and shelling, including in the southern city of Rafah near the Egyptian border — one area the Israeli army had told civilians to go. In a colorful classroom there, knee-high children’s tables were strewn with rubble.

“We now live in the Gaza Strip and are governed by the American law of the jungle. America has killed human rights,” said Rafah resident Abu Yasser al-Khatib.

In northern Gaza, Israel has been trying to secure the military’s hold, despite heavy resistance from Hamas. The military said it found weapons inside a school in Shujaiyah, a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza City, and in a separate incident, militants shot at troops from a U.N.-run school in the northern town of Beit Hanoun.

More than 2,500 Palestinians have been killed since the Dec. 1 collapse of a weeklong truce, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The truce saw hostages and Palestinian prisoners released, but more than 130 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza.

On Saturday, a kibbutz that came under attack on Oct. 7 said 25-year-old hostage Sahar Baruch had died in captivity. His captors said Baruch was killed during a failed rescue mission by Israeli forces Friday. The Israeli military only confirmed that two soldiers were seriously wounded in an attempted rescue and no hostages were freed.

With no new cease-fire in sight and humanitarian aid reaching few parts of Gaza, residents reported severe food shortages. Nine of 10 people in northern Gaza reported spending at least one full day and night without food, according to a World Food Program assessment during the truce. Two of three people in the south said the same. The WFP called the situation “alarming.”

“I am very hungry,” said Mustafa al-Najjar, sheltering in a U.N.-run school in the devastated Jabaliya refugee camp in the north. “We are living on canned food and biscuits and this is not sufficient.”

While adults can cope, “it’s extremely difficult and painful when you see your young son or daughter crying because they are hungry,” he said.

On Saturday, 100 trucks carrying unspecified aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, said Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority. That is still well below the daily average before the war.

Despite growing international pressure, President Joe Biden’s administration remains opposed to an open-ended cease-fire, arguing it would enable Hamas to continue posing a threat to Israel.

The administration has approved the emergency sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106 million, the State Department said Saturday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that “an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale” of the munitions in the U.S. national security interest, meaning the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement. Such determinations are rare but not unprecedented.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has argued that “a cease-fire is handing a prize to Hamas.”

Blinken continued to speak with counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Turkey and elsewhere amid open criticism of the U.S. stance.

“From now on, humanity won’t think the U.S.A. supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech on Saturday.

Protesters at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai called for a cease-fire, despite restrictions on demonstrations.

In southern Gaza, thousands were on the run after what residents called a night of heavy gunfire and shelling.

Israel has designated a narrow patch of barren southern coastline, Muwasi, as a safe zone. But Palestinians described desperately overcrowded conditions with scant shelter and no toilets.

“I am sleeping on the sand. It’s freezing,” said Soad Qarmoot, who described herself as a cancer patient forced to leave her home in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. Now her children huddle around a fire.

Imad al-Talateeny, who fled Gaza City, said Muwasi can’t accommodate the growing number of displaced families.

“I lack everything to feel (like) a human,” he said.",political

But his ambition to be Assembly speaker put him at odds with leaders in the chamber; in 2021, then-Speaker Anthony Rendon stripped him of a committee chairmanship, an unusually public rebuke for his behind-the-scenes politicking.

Low, 40, will likely make his youth, as well as his Chinese American background, a selling point of his campaign. A quarter of the district’s eligible voters are Asian American.

"It’s the most wonderful time of the year: when TikTok publishes its annual roundup of the biggest hits, and I get to see what everyone else has been doing on the app all year.

Despite the hold TikTok has on our cultural and political psyche, it’s hard to tell what exactly is going on across the platform. Seeing something served up on your For You page doesn’t mean it’s a thing all the kids are doing — it just means that the algorithm decided you might watch it based on what you spend your time doing on the app. Out of the bottomless supply of videos posted each day, you’re being fed everything from celebrity clips with millions of views to videos from random accounts with zero likes and zero comments. None of our For You pages look the same by design.

TikTok’s list of “top videos and trends” includes a striking makeup look viewed half a billion times; pet videos; fried chicken ASMR; and a Selena Gomez “get ready with me” skincare routine. Here’s a rundown of the top videos in the US, plus how many views and likes each has as of this writing:

Until today, I’ve seen zero of the top 10 videos, and besides Gomez, have only encountered one of these creators. In my corner of TikTok, none of these are viral — we don’t even know they exist.

As I wrote last year when TikTok released its 2022 recap, counting down the top-performing content illustrates just how disparate our individual experiences are on one of the most influential platforms of our age. What I’m seeing on TikTok isn’t necessarily what you’re seeing — and according to this recap, the overlap is slim between my For You page and the net average of all TikTok users. How do we make wide-ranging conclusions about an app where a consensus doesn’t exist? And what counts as “viral” on a platform where anyone can rack up half a million views and it would still be a drop in the bucket of attention and not at all representative of “what’s happening on TikTok”? (This spring I posted a video to TikTok that went “viral” — it has had no long-term impact. All that happened was a bunch of people came across it at one point.)

This ambiguity — and frankly, a generational tension — came to a head this fall after Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7th killed around 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. In the weeks following, as a siege on Gaza has left thousands of Palestinians dead, injured, or displaced, attention turned to how many views hashtags related to Israel and Palestine garnered on TikTok. Some said that the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags on the platform meant that TikTok itself was boosting the content. The company countered that looking purely at hashtag views or videos created with a specific tag doesn’t capture the full scope of how people consume and make content.

That context laid the groundwork for the claim that followed: that teens are suddenly really into Osama bin Laden because his infamous and violent “Letter to America” manifesto “surged in popularity” on TikTok. But the so-called surge was actually just a trickle: prior to media coverage and the recirculation of the video on Twitter, a few hundred TikToks contained a #lettertoamerica hashtag, amounting to 1.8 million views, according to The Washington Post. Again, it’s an imperfect metric. How many of those viewers watched for more than a few seconds before scrolling past? Does using the hashtag mean you’re co-signing bin Laden?

The truth is that there are thousands of concurrent terrible takes, niche dramas, and trends happening on TikTok at once, and even with a base of users who are engaging with the content, much of it will never break out to a larger audience. Many people are familiar with “girl dinner” because The New York Times wrote about it, not because they saw it on their For You page. (TikTok named girl dinner as the top trend in the US this year.)",technology
"The major political challenge that awaits is whether Poland, under Donald Tusk, will be able to access its roughly €59 billion tied up in the Recovery and Resilience Facility | Zbigniew Meissner/EFE via EPA

Mujtaba Rahman is the head of Eurasia Group’s Europe practice. He tweets at @Mij_Europe.

Heading up a pro-European Union liberal government intent on re-establishing rule of law, former European Council President Donald Tusk’s return to power in Warsaw has been met with relief and enthusiasm in Brussels and most other EU capitals.

But that’s where the good news ends.

While Tusk’s government will inject positive momentum into relations between Warsaw, Brussels and other European capitals, the major political challenge that now awaits is whether Poland, under Tusk, will be able to access its roughly €59 billion tied up in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) — the EU’s post-pandemic vehicle designed to facilitate economic recovery after COVID-19.

Given Brussels’ concerns — largely over rule of law, and specifically over judicial independence — under the outgoing Conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government, the facility has yet to disburse any money to Poland at all.

In theory, a disbursement should now be relatively easier under the government Tusk is forming. But reality is always more difficult.

Problematically for Tusk, President Andrzej Duda remains in office. And Duda, who is aligned with the outgoing PiS government, is threatening to veto all legislation put forward by the new government that’s aimed at overturning the PiS’s judicial reforms. However, these reforms are a prerequisite for Warsaw is to unlock its billions from the RRF.

Duda’s stance isn’t surprising. He remains highly popular among PiS voters, and helping the incoming government secure access to billions of euros would probably alienate some of his supporters. And should the president wish to position himself as a potential successor to PiS Chairman Jarosław Kaczyński, maintaining this support will be crucial.

Moreover, the PiS faces local and European elections next year, ahead of which it won’t be in Duda’s interest to grant Tusk such a major political success. Also, passing the judicial reforms Brussels is seeking would reduce the scope of Duda’s powers, limiting his political influence — which he’s likely to resist.

Duda, who will remain in office until August 2025, is therefore likely to disrupt Tusk’s reform agenda, calling into question the incoming government’s ability to tap the money Poland is owed. As the facility expires in 2026, the president could seriously frustrate the country’s access to these funds — or its productive use of them — if the money is delayed for much longer.

Thankfully, this isn’t where the story is likely to end. Rather, the change in government and Duda’s looming veto could be seen as legitimate reasons for the EU to renegotiate Poland’s recovery and resilience plan, which defines the reforms that serve as the basis for a country’s disbursements. And Tusk will almost certainly seek such a renegotiation to circumvent the president’s veto.

Indeed, article 21 of the RRF’s regulation allows for the renegotiation of a member country’s plan in case of “objective circumstances.” And in this case, Poland’s change in government and Duda’s unwillingness to approve legislation could be seen as such.

But a renegotiation could take several months, and it would be far from straightforward.

First, it could involve changing the order in which reforms must be implemented, thus enabling the government to access some money based on progress in nonjudicial areas. The judicial reforms could then be addressed once Duda’s term has ended — although this would assume he’ll be succeeded by one of Tusk’s allies, and Brussels never likes to get involved in the “internal affairs” of a member country.

Moreover, any renegotiation would have to be carefully calibrated to ensure Poland will eventually meet the EU’s standards on judicial independence. Otherwise, opposition from the European Parliament in particular, as well as other member countries that are also under scrutiny for their adherence to rule of law, would probably derail Warsaw’s efforts.

Political factors will almost certainly be in play here. Having ousted the PiS there’s tremendous goodwill in the EU to help Tusk.

Moreover, he has leverage: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is keen to secure a second term following the European elections in June. And this will require the backing of her political family — the European People’s Party — where Tusk and his Civic Platform are now arguably the most important players. For it’s unlikely the European Council will support von der Leyen unless she can line up her own troops to support her first.

Concerned as it is about a return to power by the PiS, it’s in Brussels’ interest that support for the Tusk government remains high and the coalition stable — something that RRF funds would help.

This makes Poland a perfect example of where it would be in the EU’s interest to think politically — and not just legalistically. Let’s hope it does so.",political
"Most of us have hundreds, if not thousands, of photos just sitting on our phones and computers that we rarely get to revisit in a polished way. I make photo albums, but some deserve to be more on display, and there are just too many to frame. That's why I love digital photo frames.

They're nice to have around the house, and they also make great gifts.

You might not think that photos count as sensitive information, compared to a bank account statement or your Social Security number. But it can be devastating to find photos of loved ones used for nefarious or unsavory purposes.

This is why we prefer frames from reputable companies like Aura and Nixplay over cheaper ones with less clearly defined privacy and security practices. Nixplay offers reasonable security measures, like encrypting your photos during transmission, and Aura offers the option to delete metadata, like the location where a photo was captured. However, both say they may disclose personal information if court-ordered or subpoenaed, and neither provides safety guarantees against hacking.

If you're concerned about security, you can avoid connecting to third-party services, but your most secure option is to just download several photos on a tablet and disable all internet connectivity.",technology
"Since his reign began in 2012, Xi’s endless purges have removed millions of officials | Andy Wong-Pool/Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

Something is rotten in the imperial court of Chairman Xi Jinping.

While the world is distracted by war in the Middle East and Ukraine, a Stalin-like purge is sweeping through China’s ultra-secretive political system, with profound implications for the global economy and even the prospects for peace in the region.

The signals emanating from Beijing are unmistakable, even as China’s security services have ramped up repression to totalitarian levels, making it almost impossible to know what is really happening inside the country.

The unexplained disappearance and removal of China’s foreign and defense ministers — both Xi loyalists who were handpicked and elevated mere months before they went missing earlier this year — are just two examples.

Other high-profile victims include the generals in charge of China’s nuclear weapons program and some of the most senior officials overseeing the Chinese financial sector. Several of these former Xi acolytes have apparently died in custody.

Another ominous sign is the untimely death of Li Keqiang, China’s recently retired prime minister — No. 2 in the Communist hierarchy — who supposedly died of a heart attack in a swimming pool in Shanghai in late October, despite enjoying some of the world’s best medical care. Following his death, Xi ordered public mourning for his former rival be heavily curtailed.

In the minds of many in China, “heart attack in a swimming pool” has the same connotation that “falling out of a window” does for Russian apparatchiks who anger or offend Vladimir Putin.

Since his reign began in 2012, Xi Jinping’s endless purges have removed millions of officials — from top-ranked Communist Party “tigers” down to lowly bureaucratic “flies,” to use Xi’s evocative terminology.

What’s different today is that the officials being neutralized are not members of hostile political factions but loyalists from the inner ring of Xi’s own clique, leading to serious questions over the regime’s stability.

With such a febrile atmosphere in the celestial capital of Beijing, there are fears that an isolated and paranoid Chairman Xi could miscalculate, provoke armed conflict with one of its weaker neighbors or even launch a full-scale invasion of democratic Taiwan in order to distract from his domestic troubles.

Enemies everywhere

The political earthquakes rippling out from the old imperial leadership compound of Zhongnanhai are exacerbating the already dire state of the Chinese economy.

“We see a China domestically that is challenged; an aging society, demography, a severe housing crisis, slowing down growth, unexpected unemployment because the young generation leaving university does not find adequate jobs in the private sector anymore,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads to Beijing this week with her European Council counterpart Charles Michel for the first face-to-face EU-China meeting in nearly five years, told POLITICO last week. “So quite some challenges domestically.”

Chinese financiers and businesspeople (quietly) complain they are required to spend countless hours studying “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” — a painfully turgid governing mantra that boils down to ideology-free totalitarian rule and the return of a personality cult to China.

In recent weeks, the country’s leading investment bank banned negative macroeconomic or market commentary, as well as any behavior that could suggest its bankers lead “hedonistic lifestyles.”

Not long after he ascended to chairmanship of the Communist Party in 2012, Xi began purging his real and perceived enemies in an “anti-corruption” campaign that never really ended.

Hundreds of senior officers in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), as well as thousands of top Party officials, have been arrested, disappeared or “suicided” (driven to commit suicide or killed in circumstances made to look like suicide).

The beneficiaries of this perennial purge have been provincial bureaucrats who worked with Xi earlier in his career and whose main qualification is unquestioning loyalty to the “people’s leader.”

Small town boys

These former small-town officials now make up the majority of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, which wields ultimate power in China.

One such loyal figure was Qin Gang, a former spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry whose career went stratospheric after he became China’s chief protocol officer, overseeing most of Chairman Xi’s interactions with foreign dignitaries between 2014 and 2018.

After a brief stint as a vice foreign minister, Qin was named ambassador to Washington in July 2021 and foreign minister barely 18 months later — a uniquely rapid rise that Chinese officialdom attributed to his proximity and personal favor with the “core leader.”

On June 25 this year, barely six months after becoming minister, Qin held meetings in Beijing with the foreign ministers of Sri Lanka and Vietnam, as well as Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko.

Then he vanished.

According to several people with access to high-level Chinese officials, Rudenko’s real mission in Beijing was to inform Xi that his foreign minister and several top officers in the PLA had been compromised by western intelligence agencies.

Following his disappearance, lurid tales emerged of Qin’s affair with a reporter for Chinese broadcaster Phoenix TV called Fu Xiaotian, with whom he allegedly fathered a son who is a U.S. citizen. The stories circulated widely online with the apparent consent of Chinese cyber censors.

Fu attended Cambridge University, a traditional recruiting ground for Britain’s intelligence agencies, and first met Qin more than a decade ago when he was posted to the Chinese Embassy in London.

In 2016, Churchill College, Fu’s alma mater at Cambridge, named a garden after her in gratitude for her “very rare … series of generous gifts,” reportedly adding up to at least ￡250,000, an enormous sum for most journalists.

Before the foreign minister disappeared, Fu all but named Qin as the father of her child on social media.

Then, in April, she flew back to Beijing on what appears to have been a government-chartered private jet and has not been heard from since.

China’s propaganda system is strongly hinting that the affair and illegitimate American child are the reasons for Qin’s purge.

Rocket men

According to several people with access to top officials, the real reason for his abrupt disappearance was Qin’s involvement in a much more serious scandal, involving the defense minister and the generals who commanded China’s “rocket force,” which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons program.

At almost the same time Qin went missing, the top commander of the rocket force, Li Yuchao, along with his deputy Liu Guangbin and former deputy Zhang Zhenzhong, all also disappeared.

Several other senior serving and former officers from the force were likewise detained and at least one former deputy commander died of unspecified illness, according to state media reports.

The missing commanders were eventually formally fired and replaced by officers from the navy and airforce, a very rare development since top commanders of the rocket force have almost always been promoted from within the service.

Not long after the rocket force purge was officially acknowledged, Li Shangfu, the man Xi picked as China’s defense minister in March this year, also vanished. His formal dismissal was announced in late October.

Further adding to the intrigue was a terse state media report on the day before Qin was formally removed as foreign minister in July. It said Wang Shaojun, commander since 2015 of the Central Guard unit that protects China’s top leaders and oversees Chairman Xi’s personal bodyguard, had died three months earlier due to “ineffective medical treatment.”

China’s nuclear weapons program has massively expanded in recent years and, according to people with access to top Chinese officials, Russian Deputy Minister Rudenko’s message to Xi included allegations that Qin and relatives of top rocket force officers had helped pass Chinese nuclear secrets to Western intelligence agencies.

Two of these people claim that Qin died, either from suicide or torture, in late July in the military hospital in Beijing that treats China’s top leaders.

Hostile forces

Given the opacity of the Chinese system, it is impossible to confirm these accounts definitively and the Chinese government does not comment on the inner workings of the Communist Party.

Senior Western intelligence officials declined to comment or discuss the matter when asked about the purges in China.

But the sensational nature of the claims themselves make clear the feverish paranoia permeating Beijing.

Whether by accident or design, that mood was exacerbated over the summer when Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Bill Burns said the CIA had “made progress” rebuilding its network within China and had a “strong human intelligence capability” in the country.

That paranoia extends into all parts of the bureaucracy and economy and seems to have tarnished anyone seen as too Westernized or too close to “hostile Western forces.”

One senior Chinese finance official who speaks fluent English and is a regular fixture on the international conference circuit told POLITICO by email that he could no longer attend an upcoming event outside China and was unable to speak on the phone.

He joins dozens of senior finance officials who have been removed in recent months, often after being accused of corruption.

An associate of this official said he was currently being investigated for being “too close to America” and “possibly a spy.”

This seems to be the inevitable fate of anyone who engages too eagerly with foreigners and should serve as a warning to those who still believe China is open for business with the West.",political
"Gay responded that such language was “abhorrent.” Stefanik then badgered her to admit that students chanting about intifada were calling for genocide, and asked angrily whether that was against Harvard’s code of conduct. “Will admissions offers be rescinded or any disciplinary action be taken against students or applicants who say, ‘From the river to the sea’ or ‘intifada,’ advocating for the murder of Jews?” Gay repeated that such “hateful, reckless, offensive speech is personally abhorrent to me,” but said action would be taken only “when speech crosses into conduct.”

So later in the hearing, when Stefanik again started questioning Gay, Kornbluth and Magill about whether it was permissible for students to call for the genocide of the Jews, she was referring, it seemed clear, to common pro-Palestinian rhetoric and trying to get the university presidents to commit to disciplining those who use it. Doing so would be an egregious violation of free speech. After all, even if you’re disgusted by slogans like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” their meaning is contested in a way that, say, “Gas the Jews” is not. Finding themselves in a no-win situation, the university presidents resorted to bloodless bureaucratic contortions, and walked into a public relations disaster.

The anguished and furious reaction of many Jews to that viral clip is understandable. Jewish people of many different political persuasions have been stunned by the rank antisemitism and contempt for Israeli lives that have exploded across campuses, where Jewish students have been threatened and, in some cases, assaulted. This week, when I wrote that the backlash to anti-Israel protests threatens free speech, I received many emails from people who felt I was refusing to grapple with an evident crisis. “You are worried about an overreaction when there hasn’t yet been a sufficient reaction to the antisemitism terrifying Jewish students on campus,” said one.

But it seems to me that it is precisely when people are legitimately scared and outraged that we’re most vulnerable to a repressive response leading to harmful unintended consequences. That’s a lesson of Sept. 11 but also of much of the last decade, when the policing of speech in academia escalated in ways that are now coming back to bite the left.

Amid the uproar over the campus antisemitism hearing, many have claimed that if Stefanik had been asking about attacks on any other ethnic group, there would have been no waffling. But Stefanik did ask about another group. Her first question to Gay was, “A Harvard student calling for the mass murder of African Americans is not protected free speech at Harvard, correct?” Gay started to respond, “Our commitment to free speech,” but Stefanik, perhaps realizing she wasn’t going to get the answer she wanted, cut her off and changed tack.",political

Along with its adaptable form factor, it comes powered by an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti, 11th Gen Intel chip, 32-GB RAM, and 1-TB SSD. It isn’t cheap though, and that’s why this hefty discount is welcome.

WIRED Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu scored the latest OnePlus flagship 7/10, WIRED Recommends. It received praise for its eye-catching 120Hz display, solid battery life, and strong performance. The camera system isn't up there with the best though.

This model of QuietComfort Earbuds have been around a couple of years now but they received a strong 9/10 review at the time and are now over £100 cheaper. We loved their great noise-cancellation and vibrant sound.

Sony's flagship true wireless earbuds are top drawer but there's value to be had at the much lower-end. The WF-C500 come with up to 20 hours of battery life (via the charging case), work with Google Assistant, weigh in very light for a comfortable fit, and features IPX4 water resistance. It's a lot for under £50 from a reputable brand.

LG's OLEDs are some of the best on the market and this model is down to under a grand for Amazon's sale. At 42-inch, it isn't the biggest display to showcase OLED's capabilities but it may just be the size you're after. This 4K self-lit OLED EVO version comes with HDMI 2.1, which is great for gaming, as well as support for Dolby Vision IQ, and Dolby Atmos.

For several years now, Anker has been more than just a battery pack brand and the Soundcore speakers have been solid budget Bluetooth speaker picks since their inception. The latest speaker comes with a bumper 24-hour playtime, IPX7 waterproof rating, and PartyCast tech for pairing speakers together.

The Sony PlayStation 5 wasn't blessed with an unbelievable amount of storage so an internal SSD is one of the top upgrades you can make. These drives started as prohibitively expensive but have come down in price and this pick is under £100 for Prime Early Access. It'll boost your console storage by 1TB, making plenty more room for your fave games.

Bose has tough competition in the noise-cancelling headphones but it's always run top picks like the Sony XM range and Apple AirPods Max close. Along with supreme active noise cancellation and luxurious sound, these are our favourite for call-quality.

Anker makes some straightforward pocketable power banks, but this one is a particularly clever pick up for regular travellers and mobile workers. Along with a well-sized 24,000mAh battery and 140W output, this pack has a display that'll tell you the speed at which each port is charging your device as well as the percentage of battery the PowerCore 24K has remaining.

There’s five-layers to the Hybrid to offer a combination of support and comfort. It’s also built to trap heat while also allowing for airflow. If you’ve any concerns, there’s also a 10-year guarantee and 1-year free trial.

This adaptable vacuum cleaner from Bosch comes with seven different attachments, two exchangeable batteries, and offers QuickCharging for a speedy turnaround. The add-ons let you tackle both carpets and hard floors, with LED lights added for those dark awkward spots.

If you're looking for a semi-portable PC gaming option that doesn't break the bank, Lenovo's IdeaPad Gaming 3 is a strong option. Value is squeezed out of the £800 you spend here via the AMD Ryzen 5 5600H chip, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 8GB RAM, and 512GB SSD. The combination will just about push you just into mid-range gaming laptop performance for low-end cash.

This is an extremely bit of kit but for good reason. These are some of the highest specs you'll find on a gaming laptop, with Intel's latest and high-performance mobile chip, in the form of an Core i9-12950H, as well as an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080Ti, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB SSD. It's a combo that'll allow you to take advantage of the high refresh rate QHD 17.3-inch display. This behemoth isn't all that portable but should be considering if you're after a mobile powerhouse rather than a desktop.

For those who Fitbit's slim fitness trackers aren't enough, the Versa 3 is one of its takes on the smartwatch formula. Here you'll find up to 6-days of battery life, built-in GPS, a daily readiness score, and a whole lot more with the 6-months Fitbit Premium membership that's also included.

This value pick from Samsung features as our runner-up for the best cheap phone you can buy right now. The A53 first went on sale for over £400 so, now at under £249, you're getting strong value-for money. There's great battery life, a good display, solid performance, and some good looks too. A steal.

"If Chutkan accedes to the demand, it could jeopardize her plan to begin the trial of the former president on March 4 at a Washington courthouse just blocks from the Capitol his supporters attacked on Jan. 6, 2021.

Trump is appealing Chutkan’s order denying his claim that he enjoys immunity from prosecution on the election-related charges by virtue of the fact he was serving as president at the time. The order also turned down his argument that he can’t be prosecuted because he was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate for his conduct related to the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.

“The filing of President Trump’s notice of appeal has deprived this Court of jurisdiction over this case in its entirety pending resolution of the appeal,” Trump attorneys Todd Blanche and John Lauro wrote. “Therefore, a stay of all further proceedings is mandatory and automatic.”

Trump’s attorneys indicated that even if Chutkan doesn’t grant the stay, they plan to ask the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to do so and intend to operate as if there is one in place. That could be consequential in a case that is expected to be just three months away from trial. Prospective jurors have already begun receiving initial notices from the courthouse.

The lawyers said that unless Chutkan rules otherwise, they plan to ignore upcoming deadlines in the case regarding pretrial motions, exchanges of information with prosecutors and designation of expert witnesses.

Trump’s legal team said in its 11-page filing that prosecutors from special counsel Jack Smith’s office have indicated they plan to oppose the stay.

Trump’s lawyers noted that prosecutors have acknowledged that Trump can’t be forced to go to trial in the case while an immunity appeal is pending. But according to Trump’s lawyers, the prosecutors appeared to seek to leave the door open to pretrial proceedings such as motions, hearings and trial planning in the coming months.

Trump’s attorneys rejected that approach, arguing that the former president is entitled to avoid “the burdens of litigation” while his appeal goes forward, including the impact on his ongoing campaign for reelection to the presidency.

“Concerns regarding judicial resources and costs from continued litigation during the pendency of the appeal — including financial, reputational, and political costs to President Trump and this country — are significant,” Blanche and Lauro wrote.

A spokesperson for Smith’s office declined to comment Thursday.",political
"A judge on Friday certified a class action lawsuit that alleges that Disney paid 9,000 women less than their male counterparts.

The suit is the largest ever certified under California’s Equal Pay Act, which makes it illegal for workers to be paid less for substantially similar work based on their gender.

Lori Andrus, the plaintiffs’ attorney, applauded the ruling outside the courtroom in downtown Los Angeles.

“Disney has been gaslighting these women for four years,” she said. “They love their jobs. They love the brand. But they want to be respected and treated the way they should be in the workplace.”

Disney expressed disappointment in a written statement.

“We are disappointed with the court’s ruling as to the Equal Pay Act claims and are considering our options,” a company spokesperson said.

Judge Elihu M. Berle rejected Disney’s arguments that the case will so sprawling as to be unmanageable.

Disney’s attorney, Felicia Davis, argued that the plaintiffs are seeking to compare salaries across thousands of job groups, which reflect the decentralized decisions of thousands of managers.

The class includes female Disney employees who have worked for the company in California since April 1, 2015, in a non-union position below the level of vice president, and who have been assigned to a job family and level. It covers employees from the Disneyland hotels and theme park, the cruise line, the Disney film and TV studios, ABC, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and other units. It does not include Pixar, ESPN, Hulu, Fox, or FX.

Davis argued that just because two employees are in the same job family and level, that does not mean their work is “substantially similar.” She rattled off a long list of job titles — music producers, pastry chefs, nurses, architects, ride engineers, visual effects directors, security dog handlers, Star Wars social media managers — to argue that the class members were too diverse to merit certification.

“These are different segments, different business areas, in different locations,” she said. “They report to different managers. They are in completely different industries which pay completely differently.”

Davis argued that Disney will have to put on a massively complex defense at trial in order to show that any disparities were the result of allowable factors, such as education, training and experience.

“I know — it’s going to be horrendous,” Berle said, in a lightly mocking tone, challenging the argument that there is no efficient way to establish pay disparities across large groups. “You’re telling me Disney has no system of categorizing pay grade levels?”

Both sides have retained experts to prove, or disprove, a gender pay gap. Andrus said that starting pay across the class is 2% lower for women than for men.

Andrus was also pursuing a parallel claim under the state’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, which would cover a broader group of 12,000 women.

Berle denied class certification on that claim. The claim rested in large part on the issue of using a new hire’s pay history as a factor in determining their starting salary. Andrus argued that practice discriminated against women.

Berle held that Disney managers were allowed — until 2017 — to use pay history as a factor, but not required to do so, and that therefore, there was no companywide policy to challenge.

Davis declined to comment outside court, referring questions to Disney.

A status conference is set for Feb. 9. The trial is expected to be held sometime before October, Andrus said.",technology
"The EU-China summit, the first to take place in person in four years | Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images

European Council chief Charles Michel warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday to immediately deal with ""a list of companies"" involved in supplying Russia with dual-use goods, indicating that EU countries will soon discuss whether to sanction these entities.

Some 13 companies based in China are in the EU's sights as the bloc seeks to tighten up on leakages of dual-use goods being exported to Russia, which Kyiv and its Western allies say are enabling the war of aggression against Ukraine. Absent adequate assurances from Beijing, EU leaders meeting in Brussels next week may decide to name and shame the companies.

""We have identified a list of companies which are suspected to play a role in circumventing our sanctions, and with the occasion ... during the summit, we agree that it's important to go more into the details,"" Michel told reporters after summit talks with Xi in Beijing. ""We sincerely hope that today we are heard, and then the appropriate action will be undertaken by China.""

""We will also ... debrief our member state because the member states will have to decide what further action to be done,"" Michel added.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is responsible for drawing up the upcoming package of sanctions, said she told Xi ""to prevent any attempts by Russia to undermine the impact of sanctions.""

The Chinese readout by state media Xinhua didn't say how Xi responded to those concerns, though he did say the two sides should ""increase understanding and properly handle differences through constructive dialogue.""

The EU-China summit, the first to take place in person in four years, comes as Beijing's leadership is stepping up diplomatic engagement amid an economic downturn, driven in part by growing geopolitical tension and the West's call for de-risking from the world's second-largest economy.

Xi, in his meeting with the EU pair, indirectly brushed aside the need for de-risking, and instead billed China as a partner for Europe's trade and tech sectors — as the U.S. widens its curbs on technology exports to its biggest competitor.

Beijing, Xi said, “is willing to treat the EU as a key partner in economic and trade cooperation, a priority partner in tech cooperation, and a trusted partner in industrial and value chains.”

A subsequent session with Premier Li Qiang saw more tough rhetoric against the EU's increasingly assertive agenda toward China.

""China is opposed to violations of the basic principles of market economy, [and to] the politicization and securitization of economic and trade issues,"" Li said, adding that Beijing ""hopes that Europe would be cautious in rolling out restrictive trade policies and using trade remedies.""

Von der Leyen, asked about the EU's probe into state subsidies behind made-in-China electric vehicles, would only say the issue came up during the summit.

On the question of the EU's trade deficit against China — which has doubled to nearly €400 billion between 2020 and 2022 — von der Leyen described the situation as ""critically imbalanced."" There were ""intense"" discussions with Xi, she said, and ""we agreed that we have now a list of different elements where we want to deep dive in together in the high level dialogue.""

""And this, of course, will determine the future of our relationship ... And therefore, I think it's important to see now the progress on the ground,"" she said.

Von der Leyen added that she expected to see the results of China taking concrete steps to resolve the issue of cross-border data flows, the lack of market access for medical devices, and the restrictive laws against the cosmetics industry, a big concern for France.",political
"Warm pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts of all time, especially straight out of the oven when the weather is colder and the nights are darker. It's not the easiest of dishes to make though, so I'm always on the lookout for ways to get the same flavors with less effort.

I was delighted when I found this mini pecan pie recipe while searching for Christmas recipes. The original recipe bakes the pies in a traditional oven, but if my time reviewing the best air fryers has taught me anything, it's that any recipe can be adapted with relative ease.

Granted, my air fryer pecan pies didn't look as neat as the ones in the original, but they tasted as good as any shop-bought pie I've tried. And my family and friends loved the fact you can eat them in almost a single bite.

Below, I'll show you how to create cute yet delicious mini air fryer pecan pies for the holidays and beyond.

Air fryer mini pecan pies ingredients

The only real adjustment I made when making these air fryer pecan pies was putting them in muffin cases rather than a muffin tin. I've also found ramekins work well. This recipe makes 24 pecan pies cooked in batches of six, but if you don't want to make that many, you'll need to adjust the recipe accordingly.

Air fryer mini pecan pies wrap-up

These mini pecan pies are the perfect bite-sized treat for dinner parties or family gatherings over the Christmas period and beyond. The crunch of the pecans with the soft, gooey center is delicious.

They're pretty forgiving too so even if you don't get an even edge on the pastry or your timings are slightly out, they still taste amazing.

A couple of things I've learned along the way is to make sure to oil your cases; otherwise, you have to cut the pies free. Also, if you find your pies having a cake-sponge lid that covers the pecans, reduce the amount of egg you add to the mixture. They still taste good with this sponge topping, but they don't look like pecan pies.

"Every morning of every weekday for 12 years, Thomas Montgomery punched in at the Dynabrade factory in Clarence, a small town in upstate New York. He strapped on his goggles and stood at his machine until the late afternoon, churning out components for power tools. After work, he walked the family dog, Shadow, and took his two daughters to swim practice. He became such a regular presence at the local swim club that he was named its vice president. He tried to be a good father and a decent husband to his wife of 16 years, Cindy. There were a few things he enjoyed—poker night on Fridays with the guys, playing Texas Hold ‘Em on Pogo.com, and the Dynabrade euchre tournament, which he dominated for two years in a row. For the most part, though, life was uneventful.

Which may be why Montgomery looked at himself—a 45-year-old former marine with a reddish mustache, bulging gut, and disappearing hair—and decided to become someone else. That person, he wrote on Dynabrade stationery that he stored in his toolbox at work, would be an 18-year-old marine named Tommy. He would be a black belt in karate, with bullet scars on his left shoulder and right leg, thick red hair, and impressive dimensions (6’2”, 190 pounds, and a “9” dick”). Emboldened by his new identity, Montgomery logged onto Pogo in the spring of 2005 and met TalHotBlondbig50—a 17-year-old from West Virginia, whose name, he later learned, was Jessica.

He began instant-messaging “Jessi,” who later also went by the handle “peaches_06_17,” and the lies flowed easier with every press of the Return key. His mom had died of cancer when he was 12, he told her, and his father was a military man. At 17, Tommy had raped a cheerleader, and his life became so hopeless that he enlisted in the Marines. After a stint at boot camp in June to train as a sniper, he was headed to Iraq. Montgomery concocted elaborate ruses to maintain Tommy’s cover story, creating a second identity as Tommy’s dad, Tom Sr., who bore a striking resemblance to the real Montgomery. Tommy’s access to the Internet was supposedly limited because of his military duties, so Dad, as Jessi soon referred to him, began shuttling messages between the two lovers. He also told Jessi to send any mail and packages for Tommy to him, because he had contacts in Iraq and could get them to the young marine quickly.

Tommy’s tales of hard luck drew Jessi in. He was in need of comfort, and Jessi provided it, saying she was proud of him despite his mistakes. Tommy responded by telling her that she was “the best thing that ever happened to him.” As their intimacy grew, he sent her a picture of a young marine, claiming it was himself, and confided that he planned to commit suicide in Iraq; she made him promise to stay alive for her. They talked on the phone when they could. But if Jessi couldn’t reach Tommy, she sometimes IM’d Tom Sr. to talk about her lover. Jessi also emailed Tommy photos of herself, care of Tom Sr. She lived up to her screen handle, whether she was running her fingers through her flowing blond hair or wading in a pool in a yellow bikini or showing off her long tan legs in a denim miniskirt.

Jessi fell for Tommy, and Montgomery did, too—or, at least, for the idea of himself as Tommy, a young man on his way to a future with the prettiest girl around. Tommy told Jessi that he’d had their special motto—the Marine saying “Always and Forever”—tattooed on his arm, along with her name encircled by a heart. Jessi, for her part, crafted video montages of herself for Tommy that were set to power ballads like Aerosmith’s “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” and Lonestar’s “I'm Already There.”

Jessi’s photos provoked the couple’s first major blowup: Montgomery became convinced she’d sent her pictures to other online admirers and accused her of betraying him. To apologize, Jessi sent him a snail-mail letter, enclosing one of her G-strings and a sterling silver “key to my heart” chain. She signed off the missive with “T&J” inside a heart. Tommy forgave her, but Montgomery, in his role as “Dad” and occasional intermediary, did not. She defended her mistake, writing in frustration that Tommy “has let it go why wont you.” Tom Sr. wrote, “because u will hurt him and hes an idiot and will believe ur lying ass.”",technology
"Part of / Building for tomorrow

When most people in the US need to go somewhere, they reach for their car keys. There are plenty of reasons for this: driving is easy, it’s comfortable, and it requires very little preparation. But also, it’s hard to do anything else, and maybe the hardest of those hard things is cycling.

But plenty of people do it anyway. Whether by choice or because it’s their only option, millions of Americans bike to get where they’re going — around 50 million people in 2022 And when they do, they’re facing the very real chance they might be run down by someone driving a car who either couldn’t see them or just didn’t bother to look — which happens far too often, leading to recent cyclist death counts not seen since the 1970s.

That’s because US cycling infrastructure has a long way to go before it can catch up with European cities like Copenhagen, Denmark, the bicycle paragon where the streets reflect that cycling is the norm for most people. At least in the US, bike lanes and trails are rare in the suburbs, and in cities, they can be unevenly dispersed or frustratingly disconnected, forcing cyclists to get creative to go anywhere safely. Plenty of factors get in the way here: political or cultural opposition to the very idea of bikes; resistance to changes perceived as taking space away from cars; and neighborhoods worried about the sanctity of trees as new traffic patterns are considered.

US cycling infrastructure has a long way to go before it can catch up with European cities like Copenhagen

Even for places perceived as bike-friendly, bike lanes aren’t a given. In Portland, Oregon, a city famous for its bike culture, a newly painted bike lane is in “limbo” because the city didn’t do the proper parking studies. Local cyclists blocked the crews that went to remove it after residents protested.

The US, like most of the world, is straining under the weight of cars and their baggage. People are buying bigger, heavier vehicles, causing roads to crack and deteriorate. EVs cause less atmospheric harm, but their production is deeply problematic, and they’re too heavy for the country’s crumbling roads. Car tires still create unhealthy pollution. Even setting aside environmental, social, and structural concerns, the US’s swollen SUVs and trucks are killing people more often and more effectively, and Black people and people of color are dying at disproportionate rates.

Roads and highways are also expensive. A list of Florida Department of Transportation reports on various projects, for example, puts new construction of a two-lane urban arterial road with a four-foot bike lane at very nearly $6 million per mile. Widening it can cost even more. By contrast, the most expensive pedestrian and cyclist improvement — a two-way, 12-foot shared-use path — is listed at about $410,000. Cycling infrastructure also doesn’t cost nearly as much to maintain. In fact, it’s likely a net financial benefit instead, owing to the reduced healthcare debt of more active people.

A world with fewer cars would be plainly better for the climate, and not just because of emissions. The world’s climate is barreling toward a nightmare scenario — for some, it’s already there — and cars are still rolling off of lots and onto roads in massive numbers. More cars mean more road wear, more construction, and more emissions. And as cities tear away greenery to make way for that construction or create the components to make cars and then replace it with heat-absorbing concrete, the vicious cycle continues as people use more energy to cool businesses and homes in the ever-hotter weather.

US city planning for cyclists has evolved over the years and is gradually moving away from the dreaded “sharrows” bike lane to more considered features that can be used in different situations as space and political will and funding allow. These are some of the common alternatives: Buffered bike lanes — Like a normal striped lane, buffered lanes often have no physical barriers. They exist as two stripes that create a larger visual separation between bike lanes and car lanes, sometimes with diagonal stripes connecting them.

Car-buffered bike lanes — Instead of using simple visual indicators, city planners sometimes put bike lanes on the outside of a road, with parallel parking spaces separating them from traffic. This is generally great for protection but can also make it harder to see a cyclist before turning right.

“Car door” lanes — An inversion of the car-buffered lane that creates a potentially dangerous situation. A fast-moving cyclist can be badly injured if someone abruptly opens their door without checking behind them, either because the rider doesn’t have time to react or because they’re forced to take their chances by swerving into the traffic lane. Drivers could use the Dutch reach — that is, making a habit of opening their door with the hand farthest from it, making it easier to check over their shoulder for bikes — as a potential solution to avoid injuring a cyclist.

Cycle tracks — Another term for protected bike lanes, a cycle track is a bike lane that’s protected by a physical barrier, often a curb. These can be single-direction lanes or bidirectional.

Bike box — Bike boxes are marked boxes indicating a space for cyclists to wait ahead of where drivers are expected to stop at traffic signals. They’re often painted bright green but can occasionally be other colors. Typically, the bike lane leading up to them is also painted.

Sharrow — These are street markings intended to communicate to drivers that cyclists are allowed the use of a full roadway. They’re normally used on roads without enough space for a bike lane.

Bike boulevard — Stretches of roads, normally through neighborhoods, where traffic-calming measures are employed to keep driver speeds low, making the road safer for vulnerable road users. These often feature things like sharrows, speed humps, fewer stop signs, and traffic circles.

In spite of the dangerous relationship people in the US have with their cars, when push comes to shove, many of us still love bicycles. YouGov conducted a survey (download) 10 years ago that found that only 6 percent of people in the US never learned how to ride a bike. But even as cycling to work has become less popular since 2014, StreetLight Data found a 37 percent nationwide growth in general cycling trips in its GPS-based study from 2019 to 2021. The covid pandemic spurred a cycling boom that is still reverberating.

But as the societal response to the pandemic waned, so did that growth, and it flatlined in 2022. The numbers will go down if cycling infrastructure doesn’t keep up.

Thankfully, there are optimistic, dedicated people advocating for just that.

Well-connected urban trails: clutch for cycling transit and far too rare.

Gussying up the Midwest

Milwaukee is a mostly pleasant city for cycling, with a city-spanning paved trail stretching from the city’s north end to its south end and bike lanes waiting to carry you onward from most of its frequent exits. That’s on the east side of town. Go a couple of miles west, and your options for safe routes dwindle fast.

But things are changing after the city adopted a Complete Streets ordinance mandating road designs that facilitate all kinds of transportation, not just cars. It later announced its Vision Zero policy to eliminate traffic deaths by 2037. This year, the city became an affiliate member of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), an association of cities that share safe, equitable road design guidance with each other.

Jake Newborn, assistant director of the cycling advocate group Wisconsin Bike Fed, said that former Mayor Tom Barrett managed to get plenty of bike lanes painted, but otherwise, he was very “steady as he goes.” Simple, unprotected bike lanes may actually do more harm than good in some situations, and more needs to be done.

A poorly timed car door can be ruinous.

“It all kind of came together as a tipping point as we got those different policies — the NACTO, the Complete Streets, and the Vision Zero — all kind of falling in order and then aligning with Mayor [Cavalier] Johnson,” Newborn said.

Mayor Johnson, who became the acting mayor in 2021 when Barrett became the ambassador to Luxembourg after nearly 20 years in office, was soon officially elected. Newborn said that not only has Johnson been very supportive of active transportation initiatives but also the right people ended up in the right positions in both the Department of Public Works and the city engineer’s office — a perfect storm for getting better bike infrastructure built.

“The other factor is just the reckless driving issues from the pandemic,” Newborn said. “There was this kind of collective ‘we’re just fed up with the dangerous driving,’ and one of those solutions to reduce even the ability to recklessly drive or speed is infrastructure.”

A large, broken planter that once served as a barrier for this buffered bike lane.

Reckless driving in Milwaukee got bad enough during the pandemic that, in his first act after assuming office, Johnson declared it a public health crisis. Media has given a lot of attention to the Kia Boys — more of a TikTok car theft trend than any actual organized effort — but reckless speeding has been especially bad. Drivers also swerve into the bike lane to pass cars that aren’t speeding so often that the city has a name for it: the Milwaukee slide.

“There was this kind of collective ‘we’re just fed up with the dangerous driving’”

New approaches included a road diet for Martin Luther King Jr. Drive that shrank the four-lane road to two, with a center turn lane and outside bike lanes. Milwaukee’s 2022 Complete Streets report showed that the changes caused drivers there to slow down by 10 miles per hour from 2020 to 2022.

Newborn said specific projects like the MLK Jr. Drive road diet instead of big, statewide policies have been Bike Fed’s priority for the last few years because of the bitter bipartisan divisions in the Wisconsin legislature. Getting laws passed, he said, simply takes too much time and effort because neither side is willing to give a win to the other.

That approach helped it net a major victory when the state Department of Transportation agreed to a dramatic makeover of a state-owned trucking route called National Avenue. The proposal is unlike anything in the city: it will get raised, protected cycle tracks, raised crosswalks with extended curbs, fewer lanes, and better bus stops. The change would give cyclists a new, safer east–west corridor that connects to another nearby protected cycle track that itself is a short jog over lightly used roads to the Oak Leaf trail that extends the north–south length of the city, enabling a crucial new connector between neighborhoods.

Buffered bike lanes are nice, but nothing prevents cars from parking in them.

Cycling isn’t just for the well-off

But redesigns can leave nearby disadvantaged communities cold if they don’t feel it reflects their needs. Newborn said folks in Milwaukee’s northwest side like the change, though, even when they aren’t cyclists.

“They’re walking and they’re crossing the street, or they’re taking the bus,” Newborn said, “and they’re sick of seeing crashes and having community and family members die.”

But Newborn said bike advocates don’t try to tell the largely Black community what it should want and instead focus on making sure they’re aware of the options they have for roadway designs. And he said the city is dedicated to ensuring safer road configurations are distributed equitably, rather than just making downtown streets safer.

This cut-through gives cyclists easy, safe passage underneath a highway.

Tekisha Hobbs, board president of Bike Friendly South Dallas (BFSD), has a similar report from her advocacy work in the Black and Hispanic communities of south Dallas. Hobbs said that Dallas’ leaders are preparing to update the city’s bike master plan, and they want BFSD to help them with it.

“The way it was presented to me was that, ‘hey, we’re getting good feedback, but we’re getting feedback from a lot of middle-aged white males,’” Hobbs said, “and they wanted to know more about what brown, Black people, females, and underserved people in, for example, South Dallas [want].”

“They’re sick of seeing crashes and having community and family members die”

She said a lot of people use bicycles as their primary means of transportation because they have no other choice, and many of them come to BFSD’s We-Cycle resource center to get a refurbished bike through the Earn-a-Bike program the group offers. That program is part of how BFSD gets input from its community to present to the city — Hobbs said the group talks to people about their needs when they visit. It also takes a more active role, inviting local neighbors to speak up when the chance occurs.

“We had a session where the transportation people came in,” she said, “and it was kind of like an open house. We invited people from the community of south Dallas to ask those guys questions and give that feedback.”

Hobbs, whose advocacy work started after a fatal crash involving a friend, said the community mainly wants to be seen and to be safe. South Dallas has some bike lanes, but the “stripes are faded [and] glass is in there,” so “making sure the city maintains them on a consistent basis” is a big focus for BFSD.

A sharrow marks the pavement on this bike boulevard.

The ground floor

Winning new cycling infrastructure doesn’t just happen on its own. BFSD has only been active since 2012, and its focus is on the basics: just getting the city to maintain the few bike lanes that already exist. When asked about a project he’d really like to see come through, Newborn said Bike Fed has been pursuing a miles-long rail trail that requires negotiating with a railroad company. But Hobbs had more modest goals.

“Personally for me,” Hobbs said, “getting that safe-passing law passed in Texas.” At the moment, Texas law says drivers should pass other road users at a safe distance but leaves drivers to decide what that actually means. In 2009, Texas Governor Rick Perry vetoed a law that would have required drivers to give a three-foot berth when passing cyclists because, he wrote in the proclamation, it would have put the onus of responsibility on drivers to ensure vulnerable road users’ safety.

Hobbs doesn’t pin the lack of bike infrastructure in south Dallas on the city. On the contrary, she said, “They seem to be really, really open to any recommendations or any feedback that we have.”

Hobbs described “the Loop” — a name given to a series of 11 trails intended to “connect Dallas to Dallas” by forming an unbroken, 50-mile circuit around the city center. When it’s finished, the project will connect to five of the city’s DART commuter rail stations. One leg of the Loop that runs alongside the Trinity River on Dallas’ southwest side connects to the DFW Discovery Trail, a 66-mile paved path under development that would connect Dallas to Fort Worth, passing through several of the mid-cities on its way.

Raised, off-road cycle tracks are the next best thing to trails.

The good infrastructure

The trail network Hobbs described to me is a far cry from the metroplex I knew growing up — I rode my bike in Dallas a lot but always on neighborhood streets and never for transportation outside of going to nearby friends’ houses because doing so was undeniably life-threatening (and still largely is).

After leaving for Austin in my mid-20s, I watched from afar as my hometown slowly became more bike-friendly over the past decade. Neither city is on top of its game yet — PeopleForBikes ranks Fort Worth and Dallas 153rd and 147th in the state on its 2023 list of best cities for cycling, respectively — but their progress has still been impressive.

Another smaller place has done remarkable things, though, and it’s not technically a city at all. The number two Texas location on PeopleForBikes’ list is The Woodlands, which sits nearly 30 miles north of Houston and is home to over 100,000 people. It’s both a census-designated place and a special-purpose district.

Winning new cycling infrastructure doesn’t just happen on its own

The Woodlands’ governmental structure is… unusual. It’s administered by a board of directors and a CEO inside a company called The Woodlands Township. Texas oil magnate George P. Mitchell created the planned community in 1974 to “entice city slickers looking for far-flung suburban quality of life,” according to the Houston Business Journal.

Patricia Kievlan, a board member of the Bike the Woodlands Coalition, said, “Mitchell had this vision to create this new model of suburban development that was really working in harmony with nature.”

“The plan from the beginning was that there was going to be a network of what they used to call the hike and bike trails which are now called the pathways,” she said, “and so we’ve got this extensive pathway system that’s nestled and winding within the forest and that lines every street,” said Kievlan.

The result is that The Woodlands is a very pedestrian-friendly community. But the district has had trouble getting new bike infrastructure put in place on the roads because of its strange qualities as a community.

The Woodlands, Kievlan said, has had a bike master plan in place for years, but for a long time, it couldn’t get them funded. That’s because most grants are written in such a way that only cities can use them — and The Woodlands isn’t a city. Then, when it tried for rural-area grants, the community found that because it already had such good cycling infrastructure, it couldn’t get those grants, either.

Here’s that underpass again — I just like this bird!

After the covid pandemic hit, the same trouble prevented the district from getting funding, so the community drew up a 2021 ballot measure to incorporate as a city. But around 65 percent of the district’s population rejected the measure, firmly putting to bed the idea that its cycling infrastructure goals could count on government funding. Still, Kievlan said, removing that ambiguity helped.

“Some of the people who were like, ‘Well maybe let’s not take action on things because we might become a city at some point’ [decided to] move forward with some of these things we were kind of holding off on because our form of government might have changed,” Kievlan said.

Fortunately, the coalition found the COO of the township, Chris Nunes, was very open to their ideas, according to Kievlan. She said the group is in constant email contact with him and works from a list of projects, from The Woodlands bike plan, that are tracked in a living document.

Over the last several years, Kievlan said, “the Township has budgeted about $9.3 million toward infrastructure improvements that included new pathways to fill in gaps.” And she said the board has budgeted around a million more for next year.

It’s deeply weird that The Woodlands is led by, essentially, a company. Yes, the lack of regulatory tape helps it move more nimbly than an ordinary city, but it has inherent weaknesses, too. Kievlan said that the township can and does do a lot with its plentiful bike trails, but only its bike trails.

“They are not in charge of the roads,” she said, “the roads are controlled by the counties.” They can work with the counties to enact change, but they don’t have much recourse if the county doesn’t want to do something.

Two-way cycle tracks like this make for pleasant city riding.

Looking ahead

Kievlan’s childhood hints at one possible future for US cities: “I think that’s one of the things that I like about living here. Having grown up here and experienced what it’s like to be a kid who biked to school every day in fifth and sixth grade. I was a kid bike commuter.”

She added, “It was safe, and there was a crossing guard, and there were pathways … that’s an idyllic kind of childhood, and I’m excited for my kid to have that childhood.”

The three communities represented three distinct phases of cycling advocacy, different priorities, and different approaches. Surprisingly, all of them felt local politicians were eager to know what they want when it comes to cycling infrastructure and safer pedestrian affordances — and enthusiastic about making those things real.

For Milwaukee, the challenges were complacency and timing, while the south Dallas community has just needed a voice speaking for it. In The Woodlands, a wholehearted willingness to make the roads safer ran into the peculiarities of its origins and unusual makeup.

In all cases, funding is unsurprisingly a challenge all around. But the work of creating cycling infrastructure has clear returns, both in terms of public health and the financial vibrance of a community.",technology
"Sam Altman will return as CEO of OpenAI, overcoming an attempted boardroom coup that sent the company into chaos over the past several days. Former president Greg Brockman, who quit in protest of Altman’s firing, will return as well.

The company said in a statement late Tuesday that it has an “agreement in principle” for Altman to return alongside a new board composed of Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and Adam D’Angelo. D’Angelo is a holdover from the previous board that initially fired Altman on Friday. He remains on this new board to give the previous board some representation, we’re told.

People familiar with the negotiations say that the main job of this small initial board is to vet and appoint an expanded board of up to nine people that will reset the governance of OpenAI. Microsoft, which has committed to investing billions in the company, wants to have a seat on that expanded board, as does Altman himself. During a press tour this week, CEO Satya Nadella said the company didn’t want any more “surprises.”

The very human power struggle at the center of all this seems not yet completely over

We’re told that both sides have agreed to an investigation into this whole saga. That investigation will presumably be done by an outside, independent law firm. Based on our conversations with people involved, the very human power struggle at the center of all this seems not yet completely over.

All key parties have posted about the deal for Altman to return, which we’re told is a done deal minus some last-minute paperwork. On X (formerly Twitter), Altman said that “everything I’ve done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together.”

One of OpenAI’s other big investors, Thrive Capital, called the return of Altman “the best outcome for the company, its employees, those who build on their technologies, and the world at large.”

“OpenAI has the potential to be one of the most consequential companies in the history of computing,” Thrive partner Kelly Sims said in a statement shared with The Verge. “Sam and Greg possess a profound commitment to the company’s integrity, and an unmatched ability to inspire and lead. We couldn’t be more excited for them to come back to the company they founded and helped build into what it is today.”

Helen Toner, who was a key board member in the initial move to oust Altman, simply said, “And now, we all get some sleep.”

Do you know more about what’s going on inside OpenAI? I’d love to chat. You can reach me by email at alex.heath@theverge.com or through the contact form on my Linktree. Then we can set up a secure channel.

Altman’s return is even more shocking than his sudden exit on Friday. OpenAI’s nonprofit board seemed resolute in its initial decision to remove Altman, shuffling through two CEOs in three days to avoid reinstating him. Meanwhile, the employees of OpenAI revolted, threatening to defect to Microsoft with Altman and co-founder Brockman if the board didn’t resign.

Since Altman was fired on Friday, the board members who opposed him have withheld the detailed reasoning for why they fired him, even under the threat of lawsuits from investors and employee walkouts. On Sunday, a key member of the board, Ilya Sutskever, flipped back to Altman’s camp after being pleaded with by Brockman’s wife. (Sutskever officiated their wedding at OpenAI headquarters — that’s how deep this all goes.) The flipping of Sutskever, who is also OpenAI’s chief scientist, left the remaining three board members more vulnerable.",technology
"According to AMD, the Radeon RX 7000 series, which offers some of the best graphics cards, can run Ubisoft's upcoming Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora effortlessly. The RDNA 3 graphics cards seemingly deliver frame rates above 100 FPS with the help of FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) across all resolutions.

The Radeon RX 7600 posted frame rates up to 109 FPS at 1080p (1920x1080), while the Radeon RX 7700 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT pumped out 115 FPS and 131 FPS, respectively, at 1440p (2560x1440). Meanwhile, AMD's internal tests showed the Radeon RX 7900 XT and Radeon RX 7900 XTX hitting 136 FPS and 148 FPS, respectively, at 4K (3840x2160).

AMD used the Ultra preset for its tests, FSR 3's performance mode for the 4K benchmarks, and quality modern for the lower resolutions with frame generation. The chipmaker also enabled Smart Access Memory (SAM), an AMD technology that allows Ryzen processors to gain full access to the memory of Radeon graphics cards to improve gaming performance.

The chipmaker used a decent gaming rig for its benchmarks, so that's something to consider. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D, currently the best gaming CPU, provided the crunching power necessary to drive the Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards. AMD paired the $348 Zen 4 chip with a 3D V-Cache with 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory. The system utilized Windows 11 Pro and the AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 23.30.13.01 driver optimized specifically for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.

(Image credit: AMD)

Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is one of the first titles to arrive with FSR 3 support, so it's easy to see why AMD actively promotes the game. The company also gave gamers guidelines on how to make the best of their RDNA 3 graphics cards. Logically, enabling FSR 3 and frame generation is highly recommended for maximum performance. However, seeing how the Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards perform without FSR 3 enabled will be interesting.

"That's all, folks. What's left here are the best Prime Day deals that are still live today now that Amazon's summer sale is officially over for 2023. We've removed anything that's no longer a good deal on a good product overnight. If you missed something this time, we'd recommend checking out tools like Keepa or CamelCamelCamel as prices on tech do go up and down throughout the year.

Best Prime Day Deals (2023): Top Picks

It’s only been around for a few months, but you can already save a bit of money on the latest Sonos speaker, rated 9/10 when we reviewed it back in April. While not the most attractive product Sonos has ever put out, the Era 300 makes up for its gawky looks with typically brilliant sound and convincing spatial audio. If you’ve got other Sonos products in the house, even better, as this is still the brand to beat for multi-room audio and app control. Don’t expect to see it much, if any cheaper than this before Black Friday rolls around.

Google

We called the Pixel 7 a “steal” at its original price (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Slice more than £150 off and we’re talking about a new level of criminality. The Pixel 7’s flagship-grade design is immediately impressive and, as ever, the quality of Google’s camera image processing is superb. A Pixel also gets you the purest form of Android, and provides the swiftest updates, as there’s no custom software layer on top that also needs to be updated too.

Gaming laptops used to be gargantuan things, but they’ve got a lot more portable in recent years, and the Razer Blade 14 is one of the thinnest you can slide into your backpack. A very reasonable £1,349 gets you an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU paired with a powerful AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU. Together you’ll be able to run full-fat PC games without the slender lappy breaking too much of a sweat. The 14-Inch 1440p display is definitely on the smaller side for a gaming laptop, but if transportability is what you’re after, this one is hard to top.

It’s not new, but Roku’s Streambar has long been the soundbar to beat for those short on space. We said as much in our guide to the best soundbars. The diminutive Streambar isn’t going to fill a large living room with sound, but it’s perfect for tight spaces, considerably upgrading tinny TV speakers with its true stereo sound. It can also effectively turn any telly into a smart one, thanks to the built-in Roku player. For £59 this is a stupendously good deal.

You may not have considered an Honor phone before, but this deal might make you reconsider. The Magic 5 Pro has Samsung Galaxy S23+-matching, and even beating, tech for £250 less thanks to this deal. We touched on it in our review of the folding Honor Magic Vs (7/10), calling it the more sensible all-round buy at this point. Highlights include a great primary camera, 3.5x optical zoom, Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and, with this particular model, 512GB storage.

The Fitbit Charge 5 is perhaps the best deal in the Fitbit line-up. It has most of the features of the Fitbit Sense watches, including ECG heart rate readings. But it costs far less. Is it actually a great Prime Day deal, though? The Charge 5 has been sold around the £100 mark many times since late 2022. However, it’s rare to see this wearable selling for any less, so go ahead. It’s £34 cheaper than the price the tracker sold for direct from the Fitbit store just before Prime Day.

Laptops and Gaming Deals

A lot of Prime Day’s gaming laptop deals are duds, but this one is not. The price of the FX507ZV here is £100 lower than what you’d pay at Scan. While this particular spec of the Tuf Gaming G15 has a last-generation 12th Gen Intel CPU, it is still powerful. And, crucially, it has a high power version of the Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU. Unlike slightly older models, it supports frame generation, unlocking much smoother gameplay even in super-challenging titles.

A big (small) favorite of LEGO's adult-targeted Botanical Collection, this bonsai tree set is one you’ll want to display. You’ll build the tree, its pot, and a slatted wood-effect stand, choosing between green leaves and pink cherry blossom flowers. If LEGO is a form of mindfulness, there probably isn’t a better fit for it than this uber-chill build.

If you’re looking for the ultimate gaming monitor that doesn’t cost more than the PC itself, this might be it. 1440p resolution is the sweet spot for most folks, and the Samsung Odyssey G7’s 32-inch size will seem immersive at close quarters. Its image quality is excellent thanks to good color depth and strong, for an LCD, contrast. The 240Hz refresh rate makes motion appear super-smooth too. The one caveat is we don’t recommend this for use as a TV as its VA screen panel does not result in ultra-wide viewing angles. But, hey, it’s a PC monitor, not a TV. We called it the “best mainstream curved gaming monitor” in our group test.

The cheapest decent gaming headset we've found this Prime Day, this wired Razer headset offers you a few things for £30: a light and comfy build at just 250g and 40mm drivers that sound pretty good.

We've had to stop WIRED's Gear team from adding any more Star Wars merch for the rest of the sale, for fear of overdoing it. Here's one last-minute addition, though: a 474-piece X-Wing that's suitable for ages five and older.

In recent years it’s been all but impossible to purchase a PS5 at all, let alone one on sale, but Sony’s hardware shortage issues are a thing of the past and we’re finally starting to see deals on the console we scored 9/10 back in 2020. Amazon is currently offering the console bundled with the excellent God of War Ragnarok for £454, which is a good price given that the PS5 alone still has an RRP of £480 and the included game isn’t yet a year old. It’s also arguably the best-looking PS5 game to date, so there’s no better way to christen your shiny new console. If you’re all in on a discless future, Very is currently selling the same bundle for slightly less than Amazon, only here you get the digital-only edition.

Headphones and Speaker Deals

Sony

These headphones are ancient in tech terms. They were released in 2020, and even their successor the Sony WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends, now £319) are getting on a bit. However, headphones age much better than phones, and this pair is absolutely worth getting at this price. We called them “our new favorite headphones bar none,” back in 2020. They provide great sound quality, strong active noise cancellation, and a battery life of up to 30 hours. The follow-up pair sounds slightly better and lasts longer, but £120 better? Maybe not.

The JBL GO 3 is a true pocket rocket. It’s a Bluetooth speaker that fits in the palm of your hand but still has some low-end punch thanks to the use of a bass-boosting passive radiator. IP67 water resistance means you can take this little champ virtually anywhere. There are limits, of course, and the Go 3 doesn’t have the dynamics, volume, or presence of the larger JBL Flip 6 (£99, that's £32 off), which is also on sale. However, this one is cheap enough to be considered an impulse buy.

In our 2022 review of these earphones, we said Bose had “casually delivered the best noise-canceling earbuds you can currently buy” (8/10). Perhaps that is no great surprise when Bose is the brand that made much of the public realize active noise cancellation was a thing. The silencing effect of the ANC here is stunning, capable of lowering your heart rate in what would otherwise be sonically stressful situations. They lack a couple of features you’ll find on rival buds, like wireless charging and fast charging, but if ANC is a priority, pick up a pair.

These keenly priced wireless earphones from a British hifi legend received some mixed notices when they were released back in 2021, for basically one reason. At launch, they had pretty dodgy wireless reception, which has been ameliorated since. They always sounded fantastic for the money, leaving the only key downside that they don’t have active noise cancellation. In return, though, battery life is excellent. The Melomania Touch lasts up to nine hours per charge, 50 hours all in with a filled charging case.

Smart Home and Kitchen Deals

A lot of coffee machines are on offer this Prime Day, but the Sage the Barista Express is among the most enjoyable to use. It is what sounds like a contradiction in terms—a manual bean-to-cup machine. You move the hopper from the grinder to the espresso maker, making you feel like a proper barista type. It also limits where the coffee grounds end up internally, making long-term upkeep of the machine that bit simpler.

Ninja air fryers have been a big hit this Prime Day, and while some of the best deals have died off, you can still grab this family-sized 10-in-1 model at a discount. Its 5.7L drawer will accommodate multiple portions and is dishwasher-safe, and you can choose from a large suite of cooking modes that include steam, grill, roast, bake, saute, dehydrate, and slow book, as well as your default air fry.

Nanoleaf

Nanoleaf products are popular with gamers, but anyone looking for a versatile smart lighting setup for their living room or bedroom should be paying attention. The deal here is for the starter kit of nine triangular panels (currently our pick for the best smart light panels you can buy), but these can be mixed and matched with various other shapes as your modular assortment takes shape. They’re touch-sensitive, and with the app, you can choose from a huge range of colors and lighting effects. We have had the occasional connectivity issue, but much less since Nanoleaf added Thread support via a firmware update.

TV and Soundbar Deals

LG

Bose has a solid range of Dolby Atmos soundbars, and the Smart Soundbar 900 ticks all the important boxes. It boasts upward-firing drivers for proper overhead Atmos effects, a single connection to your TV, built-in Alexa and Google Assistant voice control, and support for streaming via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. Bose is one of the brands still offering plenty of Prime Day offers so be sure to shop around.

You love your TV when you’re watching The Ashes or The Bear, but the second it’s turned off it becomes a room-dominating black rectangle. Unless of course, your TV is Samsung’s The Frame, which doubles as a digital painting that automatically adjusts its brightness according to the room. It might not be the very best TV Samsung will sell you, but it’s surely the most aesthetically pleasing. On the specs side, you’re getting a 4K QLED HDR display with anti-reflective matte glass and Samsung’s Quantum Dot tech. At 43 inches this is probably one for a bedroom or small living room, but £779 is a good deal.

This deal may be on Amazon’s site, but it sells through Peter Tyson and is not strictly a Prime Day sale. But it is worthy of your attention. The Formation 3 is a luxury soundbar from Bowers & Wilkins that usually costs £899, and still does elsewhere. It hooks up to your TV using eARC, with an HDMI cable and is ideal for simple setups where you just want a major upgrade over your TV’s own sound quality. The concept is you don’t need a subwoofer or supplementary speakers with this soundbar. This won’t suit hi-fi nerds but will appeal to those who would rather not ruin the look of their living room.",technology
"Moon Studios, the team behind the beautiful and incredibly hard Ori games, has announced its next project. It’s called No Rest for the Wicked and is described as “a mature, precision action role-playing game.” The game is launching in early access on PC in early 2024, with a full release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S planned for sometime afterward. And, of course, it looks absolutely stunning. Here’s the age-gated trailer.

It’ll be Moon’s first title outside of the Ori series, and it sounds like there is a very large focus on combat. In a press release, the studio says that “fights in the game are animation-driven, direct, and tactile, allowing skilled players to combine visceral strikes and deadly moves.” It also features co-op for up to four players, with players able to “share their world and progress.”

And as for the premise, here’s the fantasy world the game takes place in:

In the year 841, a pivotal moment dawns upon the kingdom, marked by the passing of King Harol Bolein. A devastating conflict arises when a peaceful transition of power devolves into chaos. In addition to this political turmoil, a deadly plague has reemerged on the remote island of Sacra, twisting the land and its inhabitants. Players must brandish their arms in an effort to quell both the grotesque beasts and the Kingdom’s invading army throughout a turbulent atmosphere where they are pulled in every direction

The game is being published by Take-Two’s label Private Division, which is also working with Pokémon studio Game Freak on an action-adventure game with the codename “Project Bloom.”",technology
"Graid's SupremeRAID technology combines a GPU with a software-defined storage (SDS) stack to deliver frighteningly high storage speeds that go above what most servers can hit today with conventional RAID configurations.

By pairing Graid's SupremeRAID card with the Nvidia RTX A2000 GPU, Storage Review managed to hit 5.6M IOPS at 1.1ms using the best RAID performance at 4K chunk size, while Graid landed a result of 28.5M IOPS in the same test.

The system they used fitted a Supermicro AS-2125HS-TNR server with two AMD EPYC 9654 CPUs, 384GB DRAM, and 24 3.84TB KIOXIA’s CM7-R Gen5 SSDs. They configured the drives into a RAID5 configuration with a 4K stripe size for Graid.

The best RAID configuration hit 205k IOPS at 15.01ms with 64K chunk, compared to Graid which hit 2.02M IOPS at 1.52ms.

RAID vs SupremeRAID

RAID cards are limited to 28GB/s speeds with Gen4 SSDs, with four Gen4 SSDs saturating one RAID card, and several required to maximize usage of a 24-bay server.

SupremeRAID, on the other hand, can support 32 drives in one system and isn't limited by maximum PCIe slot bandwidth. Using the Graid system, therefore, may work to resolve the bottlenecks in a conventional server confiugration.

It also gives the GPU license to handle the drive management and data protection – alleviating this from the CPU and freeing it to run applications.

Storage Review used Nvidida A2000 GPUs in testing, which are relatively inexpensive, to hit 28M IOPS alongside speeds of up to 260GB/s. This is despite the card using a Gen4 interface, but this doesn't prevent it from reaching performance levels of Gen5 SSDs.

The fastest SSDs in isolation can hit speeds approaching 15GB/s, by contrast, with Phison’s PS5026-E26 Max14um Gen5 SSD , for instance, reaching sequential read speeds of 14,175MB/s and writes of 12,741MB/s

Although the publication tested this on Nvidia A2000 GPUs, meanwhile, Graid's software is compatible with just about any Nvidia GPU. These are easy to install and don't require additional battery power, it added.

"Bambu Lab has teased an upcoming, high-speed 3D printer, due to launch December 14th. The company's Tweet merely shows a rendering a of a printer that looks a lot like the Bambu Lab A1 mini and says ""Big bro is coming for the holidays."" Just from image and the language, you might guess that this upcoming device will be the full-size Bambu Lab A1 (non-mini).

And indeed, 3D printing influencer Uncle Jessy later posted an image of the box (which the company had sent him with permission to post), which makes clear that the new printer is indeed the Bambu Lab A1, a bed-slinger-style, open-frame printer which, like its sibling, will run fast and have an optional AMS unit for multicolor.

""Big"" News!Stay tuned for December 14th.https://t.co/TyCmACSjgt pic.twitter.com/tkCmVY6QzZDecember 7, 2023 See more

Some reviewers and influencers, including Uncle Jessy, have gotten their hands on the new Bambu Lab A1, though coverage is embargoed. However, as far as we know, only Uncle Jessy was allowed to post a picture and only of the box. Bambu Lab has sent us a review unit as well and we will post our review on the 14th when the embargo is lifted.

Details are scant about the new Bambu Lab A1 but the same can’t be said for the A1 Mini. We published our review of the Bambu Lab A1 Mini in October of this year and were overall very impressed with its performance.

Although it’s a bed slinger, it was able to reach notably fast speeds that rival some of Bambu Lab’s Core XY printers. Our biggest gripe was the lack of build volume which is alleviated by the release of the Bambu Lab A1.

We don’t know how much the new printer will cost but it will undoubtedly be a bit more than the A1 Mini. The base A1 Mini model is $299 (this does not include an AMS) which would put the A1 at potentially $399 or $499. We will share more information about the price when it’s officially confirmed.

You can currently pre-order the Bambu Lab A1 Mini if build volume isn’t a huge concern for you. If you want to hold out for the A1, follow Bambu Lab and check back on December 14th to see what it brings to the table.",technology
"A federal tax credit funded through the Inflation Reduction Act can currently shave up to $7,500 off the price of Tesla’s Model 3, but that’s about to drop in half. The tax credit will fall to $3,750 by January 1st, 2024 for the Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Model 3 Long Range, the company warned.

Elon Musk’s company made the announcement via a banner on Tesla’s website, TechCrunch reports. Starting at around $36,000, the Model 3 comes with the lowest cost of any Tesla vehicle. Now, Tesla says the full tax credit will only be available to deliveries made through December.

Why? It looks like Tesla will be unable to meet sourcing requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). That might also affect tax credits for the Model Y and Model X next year.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit can save customers up to $7,500 on a new electric vehicle. But before that kicks in, carmakers need to meet a bunch of requirements around where the vehicle and its battery were made and how it sourced materials. The Department of the Treasury proposed new guidance for tax credits within the IRA last week.

Starting next year, “an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any battery components that are manufactured or assembled by a [foreign entity of concern] FEOC,” the new guidance says. The Department of Energy says FEOCs include entities “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of” governments including China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.",technology
"The universe is a hologram.

At least, that’s one of the central ideas in celestial holography, which is what Dr. Sabrina Gonzalez Pasterski works on. She’s the founder and principal investigator of the Celestial Holography Initiative at the Perimeter Institute.

The Universe Is a What?

Yes, you read that right: The universe might indeed be a hologram. Celestial holography explores the idea that our perception of reality is projected inward from some sort of wrapper around the universe. It’s a useful way to conceive of the universe when it comes to theoretical physics. “You want one framework that can describe both collisions at CERN as well as gravitational waves,” explains Dr. Pasterski.

Celestial holography allows physicists to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, and it originates in the quantum physics of black holes. It’s a complex idea, to say the least, but here’s what’s important about it: Celestial holography is a larger way to discuss and think about the universe, across fields and perspectives. “It’s trying to apply insights from string theory and black hole information into real-world evidence,” says Dr. Pasterski.

Dr. Pasterski founded the Celestial Holography Initiative because it’s important to be able to bring different fields together under one larger umbrella. “You have these beautiful frameworks you wish could be simplified into one consistent framework,” she says. “And the Holy Grail is kind of trying to understand a theory of quantum gravity—is basically making that knowledge canon more condensed.”

The Celestial Holography Initiative became Dr. Pasterski’s pet project right after she was hired at the Perimeter Institute. That’s significant because Perimeter is one of the few places where theoretical physics is front and center. Dr. Pasterski also credits her colleagues and those who hired her with making sure the Celestial Holography Initiative happened.

A Long Journey From Aerospace to Physics

But Sabrina Gonzalez Paterski didn’t always want to be a theoretical physicist. As a child, she became interested in aerospace, a passion her parents encouraged. When she was 9 years old, she started taking flight lessons. “I flew solo in my Cessna at 14,” she says.

As she went through school, however, she realized that aerospace wasn’t what called to her. “I went to MIT thinking I’m going to do aerospace engineering,” she says. “But I was kind of disappointed because everyone just wanted to play with drones.” Building a quadcopter didn’t exactly fire up her imagination, and she began to feel aerospace was a stagnant field.

“The thing that you can run into is that sometimes fields are really exciting, and then it becomes an engineering question where you don’t want to make a mistake,” she says. When people told her later that string theory was stagnant, she’d laugh and say, “You haven’t seen aerospace! It’s just getting around red tape!”",technology
"John Kerry said he hopes people will “come together around good, common-sense solutions” to fight climate change | Sean Gallup/Getty Images

The United States must end “crazy” oil and gas subsidies to achieve its climate goals, but a stalled Congress is preventing President Joe Biden from taking action, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told POLITICO.

“The subsidies are crazy, and we have them still in the United States,” Kerry said in an interview with POLITICO’s Power Play podcast. “President Biden has said we've gotta get rid of these subsidies. But again … you have to legislate to do that and we've been pretty gridlocked in our country for a period of time.”

As the U.S. heads into a presidential election year, Kerry said he hopes people will put aside “party labels” and “come together around good, common-sense solutions” to fight climate change. The U.S. diplomat, who is currently in Dubai for the COP28 summit, is preparing to welcome the U.S. Republican congressional delegation, slated to arrive in the United Arab Emirates later this week.

Donald Trump, the American conservatives' standard bearer and front-runner to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, has been notoriously skeptical on climate issues, even pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate deal during his time in the White House.

“I really look forward to meeting with the congressional delegation,” Kerry told POLITICO. “They have legitimate points of view about some ways to try to come at this problem. Not everybody has to attack it the same way.”

Kerry also shrugged off COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber's controversial remarks that there is “no science” behind demands for a fossil fuel phaseout. The comments, published by the Guardian, struck a chord with al-Jaber's critics, who have long questioned whether the COP28 chief can credibly lead the climate talks given his other role as CEO of the UAE's state-owned oil company, Adnoc.

Al-Jaber’s comments may require “clarification,” Kerry told POLITICO, but he made it clear he is not withdrawing his long-standing support for the COP28 chief.

“Look, he's gotta decide how he wants to phrase it, but the bottom line is this COP needs to be committed to phasing out all unabated fossil fuel,” Kerry said. ""That means we cannot allow the emissions to be going up for sure.""

“I think he was saying that the science doesn't dictate the methodology that you have to use,” he added. “You have to choose between many different ways of doing it.”

As the COP28 host country, the UAE has also been under scrutiny for its role as a large oil producer and exporter, especially after leaked documents indicated the country planned to use the summit to push fossil fuel deals.

Kerry agreed the UAE must “cut [oil and gas production], and everybody needs to be reducing supply and demand.”

“We all have to be part of hitting this goal of keeping the earth's temperature limit to 1.5 degrees,” he said.",political
"Homelessness is an American tragedy, but it’s not hopeless. In a recent column, I explored how Houston has become a national model by reducing homelessness by more than 60 percent.

One takeaway is that homelessness, above all, reflects a shortage of cheap housing. So I’m intrigued by an approach to providing such housing that’s gaining ground around the country. It’s an idea so old, it seems new: converting single-family houses to rooming houses.

Rooming houses, boardinghouses or single room occupancy (S.R.O.) hotels used to be ubiquitous. President Thomas Jefferson stayed in a boardinghouse for several months before moving into the White House. At the seedier end, S.R.O.s largely disappeared over the past half-century, partly because of zoning and economic development projects.

In Houston I dropped in on a home operated by PadSplit, a company that offers furnished bedrooms for working-class Americans. PadSplit, which is something like a long-term Airbnb for rooming houses, has housed 22,000 people so far and is growing fast.",political

"You probably keep a backup of important personal files, photos, and videos on a flash drive or external hard drive. In the not-too-distant future, you might store that data in DNA instead.

French company Biomemory wants to bring personal DNA-based data storage to the public. Today, the company announced the availability of wallet-sized cards that store one kilobyte of text data each—the equivalent of a short email—using DNA as the storage medium. At $1,000 for two identical cards, the price isn’t exactly comparable to a memory stick. At least not yet.

Erfane Arwani, CEO of Biomemory, sees his firm’s offering as an experiment of sorts. “We wanted to demonstrate that our process is ready to be shown to the world,” he says.

At a time when the rate of data creation around the world will soon outpace the amount of storage space available, researchers are exploring the idea of saving information in strands of DNA. Companies like Microsoft are developing DNA storage capabilities, while other groups have successfully encoded songs, videos, TV shows, and even malware in the genetic material.

One major benefit of DNA is that it is a far denser storage medium than current electronics. The Wyss Institute at Harvard estimates that a single gram of DNA can hold around 36 million copies of the Avengers: Endgame movie. It’s also stable over time and requires less energy than the solid state drives and hard disk drives used in today’s data centers. Once information is encoded into DNA, it doesn’t require energy use until it’s retrieved using a DNA sequencer.

Biomemory is promising a minimum lifespan of 150 years—a lot longer than current digital data storage methods. Hard disk drives last about five years, while flash drives last for around 10 years.",technology

A big (small) favorite of LEGO's adult-targeted Botanical Collection, this bonsai tree set is one you’ll want to display. You’ll build the tree, its pot, and a slatted wood-effect stand, choosing between green leaves and pink cherry blossom flowers. If LEGO is a form of mindfulness, there probably isn’t a better fit for it than this uber-chill build.

If you’re looking for the ultimate gaming monitor that doesn’t cost more than the PC itself, this might be it. 1440p resolution is the sweet spot for most folks, and the Samsung Odyssey G7’s 32-inch size will seem immersive at close quarters. Its image quality is excellent thanks to good color depth and strong, for an LCD, contrast. The 240Hz refresh rate makes motion appear super-smooth too. The one caveat is we don’t recommend this for use as a TV as its VA screen panel does not result in ultra-wide viewing angles. But, hey, it’s a PC monitor, not a TV. We called it the “best mainstream curved gaming monitor” in our group test.

The cheapest decent gaming headset we've found this Prime Day, this wired Razer headset offers you a few things for £30: a light and comfy build at just 250g and 40mm drivers that sound pretty good.

We've had to stop WIRED's Gear team from adding any more Star Wars merch for the rest of the sale, for fear of overdoing it. Here's one last-minute addition, though: a 474-piece X-Wing that's suitable for ages five and older.

In recent years it’s been all but impossible to purchase a PS5 at all, let alone one on sale, but Sony’s hardware shortage issues are a thing of the past and we’re finally starting to see deals on the console we scored 9/10 back in 2020. Amazon is currently offering the console bundled with the excellent God of War Ragnarok for £454, which is a good price given that the PS5 alone still has an RRP of £480 and the included game isn’t yet a year old. It’s also arguably the best-looking PS5 game to date, so there’s no better way to christen your shiny new console. If you’re all in on a discless future, Very is currently selling the same bundle for slightly less than Amazon, only here you get the digital-only edition.

Headphones and Speaker Deals

Sony

These headphones are ancient in tech terms. They were released in 2020, and even their successor the Sony WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends, now £319) are getting on a bit. However, headphones age much better than phones, and this pair is absolutely worth getting at this price. We called them “our new favorite headphones bar none,” back in 2020. They provide great sound quality, strong active noise cancellation, and a battery life of up to 30 hours. The follow-up pair sounds slightly better and lasts longer, but £120 better? Maybe not.

The JBL GO 3 is a true pocket rocket. It’s a Bluetooth speaker that fits in the palm of your hand but still has some low-end punch thanks to the use of a bass-boosting passive radiator. IP67 water resistance means you can take this little champ virtually anywhere. There are limits, of course, and the Go 3 doesn’t have the dynamics, volume, or presence of the larger JBL Flip 6 (£99, that's £32 off), which is also on sale. However, this one is cheap enough to be considered an impulse buy.

In our 2022 review of these earphones, we said Bose had “casually delivered the best noise-canceling earbuds you can currently buy” (8/10). Perhaps that is no great surprise when Bose is the brand that made much of the public realize active noise cancellation was a thing. The silencing effect of the ANC here is stunning, capable of lowering your heart rate in what would otherwise be sonically stressful situations. They lack a couple of features you’ll find on rival buds, like wireless charging and fast charging, but if ANC is a priority, pick up a pair.

These keenly priced wireless earphones from a British hifi legend received some mixed notices when they were released back in 2021, for basically one reason. At launch, they had pretty dodgy wireless reception, which has been ameliorated since. They always sounded fantastic for the money, leaving the only key downside that they don’t have active noise cancellation. In return, though, battery life is excellent. The Melomania Touch lasts up to nine hours per charge, 50 hours all in with a filled charging case.

Smart Home and Kitchen Deals

A lot of coffee machines are on offer this Prime Day, but the Sage the Barista Express is among the most enjoyable to use. It is what sounds like a contradiction in terms—a manual bean-to-cup machine. You move the hopper from the grinder to the espresso maker, making you feel like a proper barista type. It also limits where the coffee grounds end up internally, making long-term upkeep of the machine that bit simpler.

Ninja air fryers have been a big hit this Prime Day, and while some of the best deals have died off, you can still grab this family-sized 10-in-1 model at a discount. Its 5.7L drawer will accommodate multiple portions and is dishwasher-safe, and you can choose from a large suite of cooking modes that include steam, grill, roast, bake, saute, dehydrate, and slow book, as well as your default air fry.

Nanoleaf

Nanoleaf products are popular with gamers, but anyone looking for a versatile smart lighting setup for their living room or bedroom should be paying attention. The deal here is for the starter kit of nine triangular panels (currently our pick for the best smart light panels you can buy), but these can be mixed and matched with various other shapes as your modular assortment takes shape. They’re touch-sensitive, and with the app, you can choose from a huge range of colors and lighting effects. We have had the occasional connectivity issue, but much less since Nanoleaf added Thread support via a firmware update.

TV and Soundbar Deals

LG

Bose has a solid range of Dolby Atmos soundbars, and the Smart Soundbar 900 ticks all the important boxes. It boasts upward-firing drivers for proper overhead Atmos effects, a single connection to your TV, built-in Alexa and Google Assistant voice control, and support for streaming via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Apple AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. Bose is one of the brands still offering plenty of Prime Day offers so be sure to shop around.

You love your TV when you’re watching The Ashes or The Bear, but the second it’s turned off it becomes a room-dominating black rectangle. Unless of course, your TV is Samsung’s The Frame, which doubles as a digital painting that automatically adjusts its brightness according to the room. It might not be the very best TV Samsung will sell you, but it’s surely the most aesthetically pleasing. On the specs side, you’re getting a 4K QLED HDR display with anti-reflective matte glass and Samsung’s Quantum Dot tech. At 43 inches this is probably one for a bedroom or small living room, but £779 is a good deal.

This deal may be on Amazon’s site, but it sells through Peter Tyson and is not strictly a Prime Day sale. But it is worthy of your attention. The Formation 3 is a luxury soundbar from Bowers & Wilkins that usually costs £899, and still does elsewhere. It hooks up to your TV using eARC, with an HDMI cable and is ideal for simple setups where you just want a major upgrade over your TV’s own sound quality. The concept is you don’t need a subwoofer or supplementary speakers with this soundbar. This won’t suit hi-fi nerds but will appeal to those who would rather not ruin the look of their living room.",technology
"It wouldn’t be a Game Awards without Hideo Kojima. This time, however, the director wasn’t on hand to show off Death Stranding 2 — instead he revealed a new Xbox game called OD. We didn’t get to see much of the game, which was teased last year, and the first teaser mostly just showed the cast doing motion capture tests. It ended with the tagline “For all the players and screamers.”

That said, the game does have a strong cast, including Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier. Also Jordan Peele is involved somehow. Kojima teased other big names who are working on the project, but wouldn’t say who just yet. OD is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a press release describing it as an experience that “explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear — while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film.”

In a statement, Kojima said “We are working with Xbox Game Studios and their cloud gaming technology to take on the challenge of creating a very unique, immersive, and totally new style of game — or rather, a new form of media.”",technology
"On Tuesday, the presidents of three leading American universities — Claudine Gay of Harvard, Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania — were at the center of a contentious congressional hearing on antisemitism on college campuses.

In one of the most notable exchanges, the leaders of the schools were pressed on whether they discipline students calling for the genocide of Jews. Their responses — “It is a context-dependent decision,” Ms. Magill answered at one point — drew widespread criticism.

But the administrators faced a barrage of other pointed questions at the hearing of the House Education and Workforce Committee, mainly from Republicans, who adopted a prosecutorial tone as they pushed for more definitive answers.

Here are some of those exchanges:

On chants for intifada on Harvard’s campus

In one instance, Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, pressed Ms. Gay over whether the university condoned chants of “intifada” on its campus.",political
"The first of the committee’s four Republican primary debates was televised on Fox News in August. Since the first event, the committee has raised the thresholds for fundraising and polling that candidates need to qualify.

The RNC-established benchmarks have helped to winnow the field. While eight candidates participated in the August debate, only four took the stage at Wednesday’s showdown in Tuscaloosa, Alabama: DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

The field is considerably smaller at this point than during the last seriously contested GOP primary in 2016, when going into January of that year there were still 12 candidates appearing in debates.

Former President Donald Trump has refused to participate in any of the RNC-sponsored debates. He has aggressively pressured RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel to forgo hosting debates, arguing that he has a wide lead in the polls and that the committee should be focused on preparing for the general election.

The committee has also faced pressure from Trump’s lower-polling rivals, who argued that the party should allow candidates to participate in an array of forums and debates without penalty. The candidates each signed an RNC pledge earlier this year that they would not take part in any debate that was not sanctioned by the RNC.

Without the centralized organizing mechanism the RNC provided, media companies will now be responsible for hosting future debates. It is an arrangement that comes with pitfalls, as is already apparent.

After CNN on Thursday evening announced plans to host a Jan. 21 debate at New Hampshire’s Saint Anselm College, just three days after Saint Anselm had already announced that it will be hosting a debate with ABC News on Jan. 18. Neil Levesque, the executive director of the college’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics, on Friday morning wrote on X: “We were surprised to be included on a press release by a network about a debate which we had not planned or booked.”

Reached for comment on Friday, a CNN spokesperson stood by their plans with the college saying in a statement: “We can’t speak to any miscommunication within Saint Anselm, but we are moving forward with our plans to host a debate in New Hampshire on January 21.”

Media outlets will determine qualification thresholds, not the RNC. CNN has said that candidates must poll at 10 percent in approved national and early-state surveys. ABC News has yet to announce its benchmarks.

Trump is highly unlikely to participate in any future debates, aides say.",political
"As my wife and I played through As Dusk Falls, a tense new interactive thriller that recently launched on Xbox Game Pass, we would regularly turn to each other on the couch and say, “Coin flip.”

In As Dusk Falls, up to eight people playing together in local co-op can simultaneously vote on what the game’s characters should do next. Think Black Mirror: Bandersnatch mixed with Jackbox’s many-player multiplayer brand of trivia. Similar to Jackbox games, you don’t even need a controller — you can just use your phone (though you’ll have to download a companion app).

Think Bandersnatch mixed with Jackbox

Much of As Dusk Falls’ story revolves around a hostage situation at a motel, and as you might expect, decisions can be pretty tough. In one instance, we had to pick between pointing a gun at someone as a threat or dropping it on the ground. Generally, the option with the most votes is the one the character will actually do, though some major decisions require a full consensus. If there’s a tie, the game will randomly select between the options.

Throughout our playthrough, we regularly relied on this “coin flip” to add some unpredictability. Will a character act calmly or lash out under pressure? I almost always picked the safe route, but sometimes my wife would make a more chaotic decision just to see what would happen. In other cases, some choices would be equally good — or bad — so we’d mutually decide to split the vote and let the character “decide.” These coin flips would stress me out, but they also helped the characters feel more like actual people making their own choices.

As Dusk Falls has a lot of tense situations. Image: INTERIOR/NIGHT

While it was a refreshing way to play a narrative-driven game, it’s not an entirely new idea. Supermassive’s 2017 thriller Hidden Agenda similarly turned a gritty drama into a party game. But I’m hopeful more games adopt a similar approach. In the case of As Dusk Falls, playing with my wife made what would have felt like a just-OK B-movie thriller plot into a much more memorable experience. There are a lot of branching paths, too, so we have a good excuse to return to the game.

Xbox Game Pass has a lot of great couch co-op games we can play next

And while my wife and I beat As Dusk Falls in about seven hours over the course of a few evenings, we still have a lot of great couch co-op games on Xbox Game Pass we can turn to next. Earlier this year, for example, we had a blast with the first few hours of Nobody Saves the World, a dungeon crawler where you play as all sorts of creatures and characters and mix and match their powers. It actually didn’t launch with local co-op; instead, we faked it with her on the TV and me on Xbox Cloud Gaming on my laptop. Ever since the feature was officially added in April, we’ve been meaning to go back.

Our Xbox Game Pass co-op backlog is stacked with other potential things to play. My colleague Andrew Webster has already written about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge and how it captures the essence of the classic arcade games. I downloaded the puzzle game Escape Academy after reading Ash Parrish’s review — my wife and I have never done a physical escape room, but I think we’ll have a lot of fun with the game’s virtual ones. I’m excited for Halo Infinite’s split-screen multiplayer to come out (eventually) so that we can explore Zeta Halo together.

At the rate Microsoft adds games to Xbox Game Pass, that co-op backlog will almost certainly continue to grow. But someday, I’d like to come back to As Dusk Falls with a bigger group: I wonder how the story might play out with eight people making the decision to coin flip together.",technology
"Transcript

I'm Jordan Ellenberg, mathematician.

Let's answer some questions from the internet.

This is Geometry Support.

[upbeat music]

@s39gsy asked, Who tf created geometry?

Nobody created geometry. Geometry was always there.

It's just part of the way we interact

with the physical world.

The person who first codified it

and formalized it was somebody named Euclid

who lived in North Africa around 2,000 years ago,

and we also know that a lot of what he wrote down

was the work of a lot of other people

that he was collecting and putting in written form.

But this idea of geometry as the set of formal rules

we use to carefully put together demonstrations of facts

about angles, triangles, circles, et cetera,

that's when it sort of stops being purely intuitive

and starts being something we can put in a book.

@alien_searcher asks, New shapes are just discovered?

Yes, absolutely.

New shapes are just discovered all the time.

One of the big misconceptions about math that people have

is that math is finished.

People who are geometers are typically thinking

about crazy stuff that's going on in high dimensions

with all kinds of crazy curvature,

but four-dimensional shapes are in some sense

just as real as three-dimensional shapes.

We just have to kind of train our minds

to be able to perceive what shapes in those dimensions

like a hypercube or a tesseract would look like.

@inkbotkowalski asked,

Wait, wait--a tesseract is a real thing?

Definitely, yes.

A tesseract is another name

for what's usually called in math a hypercube.

MCU did not create the idea of the tesseract

being in popular science fiction.

That really comes in in Madeleine L'Engle's book

A Wrinkle in Time.

All right, here you have a square, a two-dimensional figure,

and here you have its three-dimensional counterpart, a cube.

A cube you can think of as two squares,

the top square and the bottom square,

and then you sort of connect them together.

If the cube is the three-dimensional figure

and the square is the two-dimensional figure,

what would be the four-dimensional figure?

I guess the hypercube would have to be something

that was two cubes joined together

and it would have to have twice as many corners

as the cube does or 16.

And now I've gotta connect each corner of the little cube

to the corresponding corner of the big cube.

This is our picture of the hypercube.

And now you may say like, are there really four dimensions

or is that just an invention?

Well, you know what, when we do regular geometry,

we're working in a perfectly flat plane.

Does that exist in the real world?

Like probably not as a physical object.

The two-dimensional plane or three-dimensional space

are just as much of an abstraction

as four-dimensional space.

Okay, @ClaudioJacobo asks,

If algebra is the study of structure, what is geometry?

Algebra is the logical and symbolic, right?

It's that side of your brain. Geometry is different.

Geometry is physical, geometry is primal,

and like doing mathematics makes use of this tension

between the algebraic side of our mind

and the geometric side.

@3omega2 asks, How can I use the Pythagorean Theorem

to solve my problems in life?

Look, I'm gonna be honest with you, I can't quite imagine

what problem you might have in your life

that would be solved by the Pythagorean Theorem.

The problem that the Pythagorean theorem solves

is the following one.

If for some reason I have some distance I wanna traverse,

and if I know how far west you have to go to get there,

and then how far north,

and I happen to know these two distances,

then the Pythagorean Theorem allows you

to compute this diagonal distance, which we call C,

but we can also write it as the square root

of A squared plus B squared.

Is this the problem you're facing in your everyday life?

If it is, you're in luck,

the Pythagorean Theorem is here for you.

But in most cases, it is not.

@TMSayan asks, What is special

about Pringle's hyperbolic paraboloid geometry?

The Pringle is a wonderful geometric form.

What's special about it is this point right here

at the center of the Pringle,

if I move from left to right, I can't help but go up,

so it seems like I'm at the bottom of the Pringle.

But if I move from front to back,

I can't help but go down from the center,

So it's somehow simultaneously at the top.

It's a peak and a valley at the same time.

And this special kind of point,

which is called a saddle point in math,

is what gives the Pringle

its particularly charming geometry.

@DrFunkySpoon asks,

Sucker MCs maintain cool under pressure,

but who [beeps] with geometry like MC Escher?

What a good question.

MC Escher, beloved artist of all mathy people,

Escher was famous for studying

and using in his art what are called tessellations,

ways of taking a flat plane and covering it with copies.

It was something he learned actually in part

from hanging out at the Alhambra,

this incredible palace from Islamic Spain.

When you go to the Alhambra,

you see these incredibly intricate,

but also very repetitive figures,

which by repetition across the entire wall,

it becomes very complicated and rich.

And that's the feature of a tessellation.

Who [beeps] with geometry like MC Escher?

The answer is the unnamed architects

of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.

@Raspberry_pi asks, How many holes are there in a straw?

Fortunately, I always bring a straw with me wherever I go.

How many holes are there in it?

There are the one holers who feel that well look,

there's like one hole, it goes all the way through.

Like what more is there to say?

And there are the two holers whose view is

there's a hole at the top of the straw

and there's a hole at the bottom of the straw.

For the people who think there's two holes,

I would say imagine this straw if you can

getting shorter and shorter.

Like imagine I sort of cut it and it was half as long

and I cut it again until it's so short

that it's actually like shorter than the distance around.

A little bit like this.

Does this have one hole in it or two?

How many holes does a bagel have in it?

That's basically the same shape as this.

If you say a bagel has two holes, I think we all agree

that would be like a very weird thing to say about a bagel.

So now I'm talking to you, triumphant one holers.

If you think this straw is one hole, let's say I take it

and I pinch the bottom like this.

How many holes are there in it now?

There's just like the one hole at the top.

I mean, you could fill this with water, right?

It's basically a bottle.

How many holes are there in the water bottle?

Just the one at the top that you drink out of, right?

But if it has one hole now and I poked a hole in the bottom

and I opened up the bottom, how many holes would it have?

It's gotta have two, right?

I think the way to think about the straw

is that, yeah, there's two holes,

but one of them is the negative of the other.

Top hole plus bottom hole equals zero.

That sounds like an insane thing to say.

Both the one holers and two holers are right

in a way as long as they're willing to learn

about the arithmetic of holes.

@LiberatedSoul_ asks, The golden ratio in art? Photography?

Is that something to do with perfect composition?

Yes, the golden ratio is very popular.

It's a number, a kind of unassuming number.

It's about 1.618.

And there have always been people

who felt that this particular number

had some kind of mystical properties.

Why that number?

Well, one way of describing it is that

if I have a rectangle whose length and width

are in that proportion, a so-called golden rectangle,

it has a special property,

which is that if I cut the rectangle

to make one part of it a square,

what's left is again a golden rectangle.

No other kind of rectangle has that property.

Some people would say like you can find it in nature,

like, for instance, I have here the shell

of some kind of invertebrate like a well.

In here, we could find the golden ratio.

They say you can find it in a pine cone.

I mean, I think its mystical significance

has been much overrated.

So I don't wanna sound too salty about this,

but I think you shouldn't look to it

to improve your stock portfolio, help you lose weight,

or help you find the prettiest rectangle.

@zohaibrafiq83 asks, Why are honeycombs hexagons?

One thing I can tell you is that

when the bees build the honeycombs, they're not hexagons.

They actually build them round

and then something forces them into that hexagonal shape.

So there's a lot of controversy about this.

For instance, why hexagons are not a grid

of squares or triangles?

And there are people who will say,

Well, there's an efficiency argument.

Maybe this is the way to give the honeycomb

structural integrity using the least amount of material.

I'm not sure that's completely convincing,

but that's the least one theory that people have.

@BibbitE asks, How are there

so many different types of triangles?

This actually speaks to kind of a deep division in math,

the so-called three-body problems,

one of the hardest problems in mathematics.

With two points,

you're making a line segment that looks like this

and there's not a lot of variety among line segments.

They're all basically the same.

Three points, totally different story.

Triangles come in an infinite variety of variations.

I mean, you could have one

that's like very narrow like this.

You could have one that's nice and symmetric,

our friend, the equilateral triangle like that.

You could have a right triangle with a nice right angle.

I could just keep on drawing triangles in this little board

and each one would look different from all the others.

And that is the difference

between two and three problems involving two points.

Simple problems involving three points,

already a completely infinite variety.

@tzack16 asks, What is the random walk theory

and what does it mean for investors?

Imagine a person with no sense of purpose.

Every day they wake up

and they walk a mile in one direction or another.

You could track that person's motion

over a long period of time.

That purposeless, mindless, unpredictable process?

A lot of people think the stock market

basically works pretty much like that.

This is something that was worked out

actually a really long time ago,

around 1900 by Louise Bachelier.

He was studying bond prices, trying to understand

what are the forces that govern these prices.

And he had this sort of incredible insight, which is to say,

what if those prices just every day

they might happen to go up

or they might happen to go down purely by random chance?

And what he found is that if you model prices that way,

it looks exactly like the prices in real life.

@vikrampunt asks, Can you believe

you can take the circumference of any circle

and divide it by its diameter

and you will always get exactly pi?

Yeah, I totally believe that.

And in fact, I would say I relish it

because it's one of the things that makes circle circles.

There's really only one kind of circle.

It could be small or it could be big,

but this one is just a scaled up version of this one.

Whatever the diameter of this circle is,

if this guy has a diameter too,

if this diameter is seven times as big as this one,

then also this circumference,

that's the total distance around the circle,

is seven times the size of this one.

So in particular, the ratio between the circumference

and the diameter is the same in both cases

and that constant ratio, pi, it's about 3.1415.

I don't care so much what pi is

to 10 decimal places or 20 decimal places.

Mathematically, what's important

is that there is such a thing as pi,

that there is a constant that governs all circles

no matter how big or how small.

@taskeenhansa asks, What is the worst section in maths

and why is it Euclidean geometry?

Okay, that stings a little bit.

Geometry is the cilantro of math.

Everybody either loves it or hates it.

It's the only part of math

where you're asked to prove that something is true

rather than just getting the answer to a question.

Euclidean geometry is geometry of the plane.

There's lots of other geometries, non-Euclidean geometries.

You guys probably know the fact

that the sum of the angles of a triangle

is supposed to be 180 degrees,

and in Euclid world that's true.

But on a curved surface like a sphere, that's totally wrong.

All right, my lines are not as straight as they might be,

but if you look at this kind of bulgy triangle

and it's three angles, their sum is gonna be around 270,

like way bigger than 180.

And that's a fundamentally non-Euclidean phenomenon

that can only happen in a curved space.

We now know thanks to Einstein

that space actually is curved.

When he revolutionized physics

in the beginning of the 20th century,

the miracle is that non-Euclidean geometry

was already there for him to use.

The mathematicians had already understood

how curved space could work well in time for Einstein

to realize that the world we actually live in is like that.

@wissencmk asks, Inception, is it really a thesis

on manifold and geometry and four-dimensional space?

Inception is a little bit more

like what we call in geometry a fractal,

which has the property that it's self-similar,

that if you zoom in on it,

you see a smaller replica of the whole thing.

The more you zoom in, the more detail you see.

And that seems to me

the sort of spirit of the movie Inception.

So I think I'm gonna call that a fractal movie.

@thinkBIGkids asks, Is there any better way

to teach transformational geometry

than original Nintendo Tetris?

I spent way too much time playing Tetris in college,

so I've thought about it a lot, tried to make excuses

for why that was actually productive use of my time.

If you take a modern geometry class,

it's not just about angles and circles and shapes.

They also talk about transformations.

They say what happens if you take this shape and reflect it

or take this shape and rotate it?

Tetris teaches you that skill.

Imagine this little dude like marching down the screen.

You have to very quickly mentally figure out

what it's gonna look like rotated

and which version of it

is gonna fit into a space where you need it.

And so I think you can think of Tetris

as like a very, very efficient

and somewhat stressful training device

for exactly that mental rotation skill

that we're now trying to teach kids in geometry.

@meris_crabtree has a joke for me.

A Mobius strip walks into a bar, sobbing.

The bartender asks, 'What's wrong, buddy?'

The Mobius strip replies, 'Where do I even begin?'

You'd think in my profession

you'd think I would've heard all the math jokes there are,

but every once in a while I hear a new one.

So a Mobius strip is a geometric figure

with a rather unusual quality

that's not visible to the naked eye,

which is that it only has one side.

I'm gonna Mark a little spot with an X.

And now I'm gonna take my finger, put it on the X,

and I'm gonna start moving my way around the band.

Watch me very closely. I'm not switching sides.

I'm moving, I'm moving.

My finger is staying on the band.

And look where I am.

I'm sort of in the same spot, but I'm on the other side.

Somewhat miraculously,

what appear to be two different sides of the band

are actually connected.

@Rebecca57219 asks, Anyone currently in a position

where you use Pascal's triangle?

I definitely use Pascal's triangle

and the numbers in it all the time.

Here, I have one with me.

There's these numbers written in the form of a triangle,

and the rule, if you wanted to make one of these yourself,

is just that each number

is the sum of the two numbers above it.

So right, see how the six is the sum of three and three,

and then if I didn't know what went in here,

I could look above it and see a four and a six.

Oh, those add up to 10, so I have to put a 10 there.

So the cool thing is that these numbers

actually mean something.

Actually, they mean a lot of different things,

but one of my favorite things that they mean

is they record the likelihood of various outcomes

in a random scenario like flipping coins.

So how do you turn these numbers into probabilities?

Well, if you were to add up all six of these numbers,

you would get 32.

So you should really think of these numbers as fractions,

like one out of 32, 5 out of 32, 10 out of 32.

Those fractions are probabilities.

If I flip a coin five times,

there's six things that can happen.

I can get zero heads, one head, two heads,

three heads, four heads.

Okay, well I ran out of fingers, or five heads,

that's a sixth possibility.

And those correspond exactly to these six numbers

in the fifth row of Pascal's triangle.

If you did an experiment

and you flipped five coins thousands and thousands of times,

the proportion of those times

that you would get two heads out of five

would converge to 10 out of 32.

@harpua71burner asks,

Why does the shape of a district matter?

And I'm gonna assume that the question here

is about congressional districts.

The reason is that if you see one with a very strange shape,

that is an indication that someone has designed

that district for a political purpose.

I'm sorry to say

that like rather advanced mathematical techniques

are used in order to effectively explore

that geometric space to find the most partisan advantage

that you can squeeze out of a map.

Legislators choosing their voters

instead of the voters choosing their legislators.

So that's why we care.

@pw1111, okay, I don't know how many ones there are,

there's a lot of ones.

Why do GPS systems need to use geometry

based on the sphere in order to work?

What GPS essentially does is there's a bunch of satellites

which are in positions that we know.

They can tell you what is your distance

when you're somewhere on the Earth

from each one of those satellites.

And knowing those numbers

is actually enough to specify your exact location.

Let's say I know I'm exactly 5,342 kilometers

from a given satellite.

The set of all points that are at exactly that distance

from the satellite is a sphere

whose center is that satellite.

That's what the definition of a sphere is.

It's the set of all points

at a fixed distance from a given center.

If I have two satellites,

I'm at the intersection of two spheres.

Once you have four or more of those spheres,

they're never gonna have more than one point in common.

That's exactly the geometry that underlies GPS.

@Quantum_Stat asked,

What can the geometry of deep learning networks tell us

about their inner workings?

I'm gonna tell you the strategy that it uses.

It's basically a very intensive form of trial and error.

We make sort of some modest change to our behaviors

and sort of see if it gives us better results.

And if it does, we keep doing that thing.

I think of that as a kind of exploration of a space.

Geometry in the modern sense is any context

in which we can talk about things being near and far.

We know what it means for two people

to be near each other geographically.

Similarly, the space of all strategies

for recognizing a face, those have geometries too.

There are some strategies that are near each other

and some that are far away.

Any context in which we can talk about near and far,

whether that's the surface of the Earth

or a social network or your family

where you can talk about close relatives or far relatives,

I know I'm kind of sounding like I'm just saying

geometry is everything, but I'm gonna be honest,

that is kind of what I think.

Okay, so those are all the questions we have time for today.

I hope my answers made some sense

or messed with your mind a little, or best of all,

maybe did some combination of those two things.

Thanks for watching Geometry Support.",technology
"Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska urged Western countries against discontinuing financial support to her country | Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP via Getty Images

Olena Zelenska has warned that without continued financial support from the West, Ukraine will be “left to die.”

Zelenska, the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke to the BBC a day after Republican senators in the U.S. blocked a bill which would have provided more than $60 billion worth of support to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s full-scale invasion.

“If the world gets tired, they will simply let us die,” she said. “It hurts us greatly to see the signs that the passionate willingness to help may fade.”

The White House has warned that U.S. funds for Ukraine could soon run out, with President Joe Biden adding that the failure to support Ukraine would be a “gift” for Russian President Vladimir Putin and that history would “judge harshly those who turned their back on freedom’s cause.” Those remarks were echoed by Britain’s new Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Thursday, who said that blocking aid would be a “Christmas present” for Putin.

“We really need the help,” Zelenska told the BBC in an interview that will be broadcast in full on Sunday. “In simple words, we cannot get tired of this situation, because if we do, we die.”

Republicans in both chambers of the U.S. Congress had demanded stricter border regulations in exchange for their support for a $110.5 billion foreign aid bill. The bill failed to meet their requirements, they said.",political
"Part of / Building for tomorrow

Until a couple of months ago, I hadn’t lived in a “smart home” built within the last five years. I was lured in by the availability of symmetrical 1GB fiber internet for the same $100 that got me 500Mbps of asymmetrical cable at my previous apartment. But I encountered more obstacles getting it set up than a track and field hurdler, everything from a missing fiber gateway port to my $1,000 robot vacuum losing connection every time it tried to clean too far away from the router. I was saved by the ethernet ports in every room and my off-the-shelf Asus gaming router, but I couldn’t (and still can’t) do anything about the cable Cthulhu monstrosity lurking behind a metal plate in my closet that drives most of my frustration.

It turns out that the “smart homes of the future” cannot run on Wi-Fi alone thanks to the materials we’ve been using to construct our homes cheaply and quickly for decades. Over the last several years, more engineering and architecture firms have started including ethernet wiring in their building plans, but that’s as far as the digital infrastructure of a home usually goes. What’s forgotten is not only where the pre-built internet hub is placed inside the building but also what materials are used for construction.

Clearly, the best place for a router is in the wall, behind a metal plate, at ankle level. Photo by Joanna Nelius / The Verge

I’m going to use my new home as an example. It was built with an “internet hub.” Every ethernet cable and coax cable threaded through the walls terminates inside a nook because that nook is where cable and fiber enter the house. The ISP’s provided modem / router goes inside the nook and is then covered with a wobbly metal plate that gets screwed into the wall at the corners.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) noted in a recent blog post that if the US were to focus a significant chunk of its efforts on creating a better digital infrastructure instead of “fixing” our physical infrastructure, it would result in “superior longer-term economic growth, competitiveness, national security, and environmental benefits.” This includes outfitting buildings and dwellings with wired Gigabit fiber internet and, more importantly, taking into consideration which materials would obstruct Wi-Fi signals the least.

A plethora of architects, civil engineers, and project managers across Orange and Los Angeles counties in California all told me the same thing: Wi-Fi-penetrating materials typically aren’t a consideration unless it’s a large structure like an office building or warehouse; telecom technicians are called in then, but mainly to help with wiring. However, those same people told me they’ve been able to reduce construction costs significantly by wiring residences for ethernet as they are building them.

The cost of common building materials like brick, wood, drywall, plywood, concrete, metal, and acoustic ceiling tiles is usually cheaper than Wi-Fi-penetrating materials, especially if they are sustainable — although the cost of even common materials has sharply increased by 20.4 percent year over year as of April 2022, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). With many states in the middle of a severe housing crisis driven in part by those rising material costs, it’s likely many companies will continue to build for speed. California, for example, needs 2.5 million new, affordable homes, and at least 1 million of those must be for low-income families or those experiencing houselessness.

As for older buildings, a recent study published by several members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, mentions that wireless signals running on mmWave (millimeter wave) or high-frequency bands like Verizon’s 5G home internet have worse “penetration loss” when the signal is being received from outside. Depending on which wave band is being used and what materials are on the outside of the building, that penetration loss can be severe to the point where the Wi-Fi signal can only penetrate a single room.

With cost reductions and speed currently at the forefront of many building projects, this puts the burden on the people living there to diagnose their own Wi-Fi issues and adds to the overall cost of getting internet set up in a home. And look, that’s no different than what many of us have been doing over the last couple of decades, but not everyone has the technical know-how or the extra cash to do it.

DIY-ing your own ethernet installation can cost several hundred dollars for the equipment alone. But even if you watch a bunch of YouTube videos and are confident you can do it yourself, and have convinced your landlord you can do it (assuming they even entertain the idea in the first place), that’s not the same as actually doing it. The other alternative is paying a professional thousands of dollars to wire your place with a few Cat 5 cables. (Preferably better than the setup built into my apartment.)

I have the privilege of knowing how to troubleshoot this stuff on my own largely due to my profession as a tech journalist. To others, this stuff is a foreign language. Knowing how to set up a home internet system is not a skill everyone has, and the complicated steps required to do it properly make moving to a new place more stressful, especially if you work remotely and need the internet to earn a paycheck.",technology

Hi, I'm Dream,

and this is the WIRED Autocomplete Interview.

[upbeat music]

I like to say that I'm 6'2.

[upbeat music]

Did Dream put the mask back on?

Kind of. It just depends.

I wanna make sure that I still have the mask.

I love the mask.

It's great, and what it stands for is amazing.

So if I'm just being Dream, or I'm, you know,

I wanna represent that part of myself, then I wear it.

So it's kind of a 50/50.

So I guess yes, but no.

What is Dream SMP Minecraft?

SMP stands for is survival multiplayer.

And Dream SMP was a server that I started

with a bunch of my friends,

and it just became a bigger and bigger thing

with like, role-play.

And it was almost like people would watch it kind

of like an anime.

There was villains, and I was one of them.

Is Dream SMP scripted?

Yes, yes, Dream SMP was scripted.

There was a lot of improv,

and there was a lot of moments that happened.

And sometimes we would plan out like,

all right, well, we don't know exactly what will happen.

We want these key points.

We have like, this person's gonna die,

and we don't know exactly how yet.

And then we just kind of go through

and let things go as they do.

So yes, it was scripted, for sure.

Did Dream go to college?

I have ADHD, so I always struggled in school.

I was always like, from a pretty young age, like,

I'm not going to college.

My parents would always be like,

Well, you need to do something

if you're not gonna go to college.

So I was like, All right,

I'm gonna get certifications and try and learn.

So I learned to code.

I got a bunch of like, technical certifications.

And so no, I didn't,

but I tried to make up for it in other ways.

Is Dream a Minecraft god.

Yes, I'm a Minecraft god.

You should not mess with me. You'll lose.

Where is Dream Minecraft from?

I'm from Orlando, and Dream Minecraft's

from me trying to say dream on and inspire yourself, so.

When Dream started playing Minecraft.

Around 2011, 2010 there was a server MCPVP

that I think was the first server I ever played on,

which I think opened in 2011, if I remember correctly.

Very, very long time. Too long.

How fast did Dream,

okay, beat Minecraft?

I think almost anyone could beat Minecraft in four hours

if they put enough like, practice into it.

But it's a little harder

when you have people chasing you down or something.

I've beaten it in, you know, 20 minutes or so.

I've beaten it in an hour or four hours.

Probably the longest ever taken was,

you know, six or seven hours, so.

How to get into the dream dimension

in Minecraft?

There's no dream dimension.

So maybe there's a mod that has a dream dimension

or something, but I wanna know the answer to that question.

So we'll have to have a Mojang employee come up here

or something, but.

How tall is Dream Minecraft?

Can I stand up?

I like to say that I'm 6'2.

So I'm 6'2.

I think in shoes I'm 6'3.

How old is Dream Minecraft?

August 12th is my birthday.

I just turned 24 years old. 1999.

How did Dream get famous?

I quit my job when I had no subscribers,

and I posted my first video in July of 2019.

So I tried to treat it like a job.

I was like, All right, well,

if I actually wanna make it a job,

then I need to treat it like a job.

So I put, you know,

at least eight-plus hours a day every day into it

for a long time.

I studied, I planned,

I came up with ideas and tried different things.

I spent like, every waking hour for months and months

and months just editing and recording

and coming up with ideas.

And it was a little bit of luck

and a little bit of skill

and a little bit of, you know,

a little bit of everything kind of mixed in together.

How did Dream and Sapnap meet?

We met on a server called MCPVP.

It's a Minecraft player-versus-player server

that you would play like,

there was Hunger Games,

and you would fight other players in it.

Because it was the Hunger Games, you can make teams.

And he typed in chat, Type 123 if you wanna Skype team,

and I replied and said 123.

And we were friends ever since.

And now we live together 10 years later, so.

How did Dream escape the prison?

I was broken out by the one and only Technoblade.

It's funny 'cause like, behind the scenes, like,

me and Awesamdude worked together on that prison.

It was our baby.

We came up with all the like, mechanics and the redstone

and all the different ways.

Like, no, we're having it like, suspended in lava,

and you're not gonna be able to,

it's a impenetrable prison.

And then Technoblade, of course,

comes around and just outsmart me,

even though he was saving me in the actual lore.

What does Dream play Minecraft on?

I play Minecraft on PC.

I guess you can technically play Minecraft

on almost anything.

Your phone, Xbox.

I like more control,

and you can aim better and stuff, in my opinion.

So I like the PC.

What is Dream's FOV in Minecraft?

So FOV stands for field of view,

and it's like, zoomed in your screen is, I guess,

when you're playing.

Mine is 90.

Why is it 90?

I don't know, it's just my preference.

So I just messed with it.

And then all my friends have it as 90 now

because we agreed when we were making videos.

We were like, Let's keep it consistent.

So if you're watching everybody's perspective,

you can see all the same zoom, I guess.

So there you go.

You wanna be like me? Make it 90.

What version of Minecraft does Dream play on?

I play on the latest version of Minecraft.

I used to only play on like, 1.8 and 1.7,

which were older versions of Minecraft.

And then I actually realized

that most of the world other than like,

multiplayer servers play on the latest version.

And so I was like,

If I want to get more views on my videos,

I probably should play on the one that most people play on.

What is Dream's, this is a long one,

fastest Minecraft speedrun?

I don't know.

I mean, I know like,

probably in my videos you're talking about like a manhunt.

The quickest I ever did a manhunt like, against my friends,

which is a series I do where I'm like, speedrunning,

and I have my friends trying to stop me.

And I think I'd probably say it's probably

about an hour 45 or something,

if you're talking about with like,

three or four players chasing me.

And then by myself, I think it's around like 20 minutes.

What is Clay Dream's last name?

That is a secret. We do not speak of that.

Why is Dream so good at Minecraft?

I think it's a lot of practice.

I've played Minecraft since I was literally 11 years old,

and I've put in hundreds

and hundreds of thousands of hours into the game

and played way too much Minecraft.

Way more than I want to admit.

Why did Dream quit Minecraft?

I didn't quit Minecraft.

I'm doing a little bit less Minecraft recently

'cause I've been making music and doing other things.

Definitely didn't quit,

and I don't think I ever really will 'cause it's a sandbox.

You can pretty much do whatever you want.

So I can never really get bored of it.

Why does Dream have a crown Minecraft?

That is very heartwarming.

I'm surprised that's a Google result.

I actually just recently removed the crown

from my Minecraft skin.

I put it on after Technoblade, who is another friend of mine

and a Minecraft YouTuber that passed away.

He had a crown on his skin,

and I wanted to put it on my skin to honor him.

And then I just recently published a tribute related to him,

and I thought that it was worthy to retire the crown.

It had been a year.

You know, give it back to him,

'cause he's still, you know, he did beat me, so.

Dream Minecraft Guinness World Records.

I have two of them.

I have a Guinness World Record for the most subscribers

for a dedicated Minecraft YouTube channel.

I got it when I had 29,900,900,

and I was like, No.

So they gave me a new one on the dot at 30 million.

So I have it at 30 million.

Dedicated Minecraft YouTuber with the most subscribers.

And I have the most viewed Minecraft gameplay video.

I think I got it when I was at 103 million

or something views.

There's my two Guinness World,

and they're hanging out on my wall, so.

Did Dream win a Streamy?

Yes, I have won three Streamys.

I just won one in person for the first time

for Gamer of the Year.

I think I've won Gamer of the Year three

of the last five years, which is very cool.

I love the Streamys.

Thank you, Streamys.

Here's a long one.

Dream Minecraft versus five hunters.

I did a series called Minecraft Manhunt

where I tried to speed one Minecraft,

and my friends tried to stop me,

and I just added more people.

I did like a little, you know, series,

like, kind of, like, you know, the NBA finals,

something like sports,

where it's like, you do best of three or best of five.

Five hunters was the final one.

The videos are getting tens of millions of views,

30, 40, 50, 60, 70 million views,

and I was like, Let's end it when we're on top,

and let's end it with a bang.

The five hunters grand finale was the final video

in Manhunt series.

Might do a reunion one at some point,

but at this point it's already been, I think,

over a year since the last manhunt.

Are Dream's Minecraft manhunts scripted.

No, they're not.

But there's a lot of things that definitely can,

that people would be like,

Oh, that's like kind of scripting in a way.

We have like, certain rules that make it more fair,

but also make it more interesting for the viewer.

And then I also do a lot of little editing tricks.

So a lot of times if like, we're recording,

and I've already done a trick or something,

I have the audio recording

from when I did that trick the first time.

And so that will be in the video.

That way the viewer's experience is the same

as the hunters was the original time.

Dream Minecraft friends.

My biggest friends are all the ones on my YouTube channel.

You know, GeorgeNotFound and Sapnap are my two best friends.

But other than that, I mean,

yeah, BadBoyHalo and Antfrost

and Awesamdude are three of my good friends.

They're in my YouTube videos.

Most of my friends I feel like

that I'm closest with are my friends

that I played Minecraft with since I was like 10.

And we were all like, friends before we were YouTubers,

and then we became YouTubers together.

Dream Minecraft Unsolved Mysteries.

And that's a series I did on my channel a while back

where I just did like,

kind of a, you know, parody of Buzzfeed, in a way,

where I did like, little mysteries in Minecraft.

I was like, you know,

did PewDiePie like, revive his dog

and lie about it in his video?

Or like, why is Mojang not adding sharks?

Like, these silly little things,

but make them interesting and dramatic.

And that's kind of my flair has always been,

is kind of, you know, dramatizing things

and making them kind of movie-like and interesting.

But it's still there. You can go watch it.

Dream Minecraft BedWars.

I'm pretty decent.

I'm definitely not great at it.

You really need like, a lot of...

There's some people that are crazy at it.

I guess in that instance I'm not a Minecraft god.

Dream Minecraft enemy song.

I've done like little song parodies.

Like, I sang like

♪ Under the tree ♪

instead of under the sea and stuff.

So I might've done something like that

in a video that people were like, Oh, I want that.

And none of my songs are about Minecraft

or have Minecraft enemies.

So that's a mystery, I guess.

Dream Minecraft tour.

I am actually on a tour right now.

I'm currently doing a music tour

where I'm going to a bunch of places.

Show's been going great.

Yeah, I mean just was in DC the other night.

I have New York.

And improving each time, so practice makes perfect.

This was Dream, and that was really interesting.

A lot of them were very like, insightful,

and I guess there was a couple of heartwarming ones

that I would not have expected,

you know, from Google results.

So that's it for now.

"The oil industry’s Goliaths are placing big bets that fossil fuels have plenty of life in them | Ricardo Tomás for POLITICO

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

This article is part of the Road to COP special report, presented by SQM.

WASHINGTON — Eight years after Paris, the oil business is bigger than ever.

Profits are soaring. Production is climbing — and marking a record year in the United States. The industry is even poised to gain from the crusade to rein in climate pollution, including the billions of dollars in incentives that U.S. President Joe Biden is offering for wind farms, battery minerals and carbon-carrying pipelines.

It’s not necessarily the future that appeared to be dawning in 2015, when nations gathered in the French capital to pledge an assault on the fossil fuel pollution that’s warming the planet. But it's the reality that advocates and governments will confront when the next climate summit dawns Nov. 30 in Dubai’s Expo City, a showpiece of the United Arab Emirates’ petroleum wealth — hammering home the reality that oil and gas producers are thriving, not shrinking, during the era of ambitious green agendas.

The reasons, analysts say, include the spikes in fuel prices driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the economic recovery from the pandemic, as well as struggles to deploy cleaner technologies such as wind turbines or electric cars on the scale needed to meet the crisis.

“The death of the oil industry has been greatly overstated,” said Kevin Book, managing director at the consulting firm ClearView Energy. “The realities of demand and the limitations of alternatives haven't changed.”

The long-term prognosis for fossil fuels could still turn out to be cloudy: The Paris-based International Energy Agency reported last month that “the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era” may be at hand, with demand for oil, natural gas and coal all expected to peak by the end of this decade.

Still, the oil industry’s Goliaths are placing big bets that fossil fuels have plenty of life in them.

The United States’ two oil and gas supergiants are leveraging their wealth to buy rivals with untapped reserves — Chevron is buying Hess for $53 billion, while Exxon Mobil is spending about $60 billion to buy a Texas-based company with vast land holdings in the state’s fracking hotbed. Europe’s largest industry champions, BP and Shell, are likewise basing their businesses firmly on oil and gas while walking back their pledges to green their businesses.

The companies have all touted their investments in cleaner technologies, such as carbon capture, geothermal and mining for the raw materials used in batteries. They have promised to cut their climate pollution. But Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) dismissed those proclamations as “99 percent greenwashing,” saying: “What they're trying to do is protect their established ownership of fossil assets.""

When world leaders huddled in Paris to strike their climate deal in 2015, levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were near 402 parts per million — already high enough to threaten a disastrous future for human civilization and the Earth’s ecosystems. Now they’re approaching 420 parts per million, levels that scientists say the planet hasn’t seen since more than 4 million years ago, when seas were 75 feet higher.

Amid those warnings, even government leaders who support taking action on climate change have found fossil fuels impossible to quit.

Biden's pledge to avert climate catastrophe included a campaign promise in 2020 to halt new drilling on federal land. That triggered expectations among some market analysts that his policies might crush oil company stock prices.

Instead, Biden has presided over a record year for U.S. oil production and natural gas exports, and his administration has greenlit an array of fossil fuel projects, including oil drilling in Alaska and an Appalachian gas pipeline.

Oil company profits in the most recent quarter didn't reach the stratospheric heights that record-high gasoline prices delivered last year, yet they still beat pre-pandemic returns. Exxon reported earnings of $9.1 billion, and its refineries churned out the highest volume of fuel for that period since 1999, the company said in a financial filing. Chevron reported $6.5 billion in profit for the quarter, down from its $11.1 billion haul a year earlier but still about double what it earned in the same period of 2019.

Exxon’s share price has more than doubled since Biden took office, when the oil market was in the doldrums because of the pandemic. Chevron's stock has climbed nearly 60 percent since then.

And oil companies may be ready to rev up their production engines soon. After years of focusing on returning money to shareholders and shrinking their budgets for new projects, industry capital expenditures are forecast to grow from $500 billion last year to $640 billion by 2030, according to a report from the International Energy Forum and S&P Global.

At the same time, the industry is gearing up to take advantage of the billions of dollars that Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration have made available for emerging climate technologies, such as those focused on capturing greenhouse gas pollution before it hits the air and deploying hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel. Those technologies, along with geothermal energy and wind power, could offer opportunities to oil and gas companies with long experience in digging holes, laying pipelines and building structures offshore.

Exxon Mobil also announced plans to begin drilling for ancient salt water in Arkansas and extract its lithium, a critical mineral for electric vehicle batteries. It said its goal is to produce enough lithium to cover the manufacturing needs of more than 1 million electric vehicles a year.

Even so, some of these companies are walking back their pledges to lessen their carbon pollution. BP earlier this year said it would reduce the carbon emissions from its energy production by 20 to 30 percent by 2030, down from its previous pledge for a 35-to-50-percent reduction. It plans to spend $8 billion to grow its oil and gas production, a move that would increase emissions but that the company said is needed to keep fuel affordable.

“Action is needed to accelerate the transition,” then-BP chief executive Bernard Looney said in a news release announcing the change in the target. “And — at the same time — action is needed to make sure that the transition is orderly, so that affordable energy keeps flowing where it’s needed today.”

BP said it would also invest $8 billion in renewable energy.

A BP spokesperson said the company’s ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 has not changed.

Shell also said it would invest less in renewable energy production than it had first planned, citing low profits from that business.

But Shell spokesperson Curtis Smith insisted by email that the company's strategy had not changed, and that it still intended to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

""An unwavering commitment to capital discipline combined with exceptional delivery will create value for shareholders and allow Shell to supply the energy the world needs today while contributing to the growth of profitable, low-carbon business models that will play a critical role in a balanced energy transition,"" he wrote.

BP also said it remained committed to lowering its carbon footprint. The company plans to invest $60 billion by the end of the decade in electric vehicle charging, low carbon hydrogen, renewables and using plant-based ingredients to make fuel.

Chevron has touted plans for developing geothermal energy and cutting the amount of greenhouse gas that comes from its operations, but has also made it clear it is full steam ahead in its efforts to produce oil and natural gas.

“It’s very difficult to change as rapidly as some people would like,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said earlier this month in an interview with Barron’s. “There’s massive investments, trillions of dollars, in the existing system that has evolved over 150 years.”

Exxon has said it will spend $17 billion through 2027 to reduce its own climate pollution. But the company dismissed a shareholder call for it to release a study on how its oil and gas holdings would be affected by the sorts of reduction in fossil fuel use that the IEA forecast in its report.

“It is highly unlikely that society would accept the degradation in global standard of living required to permanently achieve a scenario like the IEA” report, Exxon said in its reply to the proposal.

That reply infuriated environmental groups and climate scientists, who have accused Exxon of knowing for decades that greenhouse gases coming from the industry would trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global climate change.

“Why aren't they out there searching for alternatives helping us make the conversion” to clean energy, asked Don Wuebbles, a professor emeritus of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois who led a congressionally mandated report on climate science in 2017. “They're gonna spend their money looking for more oil. …They're full speed ahead. That's the problem.”

Exxon spokesperson Erin Szeligowski said the company's commitment to lowering emissions from its own operations, and those from other companies through its Low Carbon Solutions business, ""is evident.""

""We’ve built an entire business dedicated to this goal, and are investing $17 billion on lower emissions initiatives over the next four years to do so,"" she said by email.

Two major developments have helped explain the oil and gas sector’s resilience, analysts said. First, the pandemic temporarily crushed oil demand, which benefited the more efficient, deep-pocketed producers who were able to buy out weaker competitors. Then Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine drove up oil and gas prices, creating new financial incentives for oil production — and even prompted the Biden administration to call on companies to ramp up drilling to ease pain for consumers.

Oil companies are facing pressure not only from shareholders worried about profits, but also politicians spooked by recent inflation, said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities, equity derivatives and cross-asset quantitative investment strategies at Bank of America Securities.

Russia’s war against Ukraine sent energy markets into an upheaval that is only now settling, and that shakeup put a focus on ensuring that countries had a secure energy supply, Blanch said in an interview.

“What is everyone worried about? Inflation,” he said. “If you don’t have stable domestic gas or oil resources, you become very exposed to whatever is happening in the world. And that’s a very worrying thought to politicians.”

Still, some reasons for climate optimism exist alongside the oil and gas industry’s resurgence, said John Larsen, a partner at the climate and energy research firm Rhodium Group.

Going into the Paris climate conference in 2015, studies indicated that the planet was projected to see temperatures rise by nearly 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century — a recipe for full-blown catastrophe. Now, it’s on pace for a still-disastrous increase of 2.7 degrees based on the policies that countries have adopted since then, according to the Climate Action Tracker, a project that assesses national progress on meeting carbon emissions goals. The Paris Agreement had set an official target of 2 degrees, along with a more aspirational goal of 1.5.

Clean energy technology has also scaled rapidly, with electric vehicle adoption taking off much faster than many anticipated. Annual electric vehicle sales are set to exceed 1 million for the first time this year, with sales through the third quarter up 55 percent from 2022, BloombergNEF said in an analysis last week.On top of that, regulators and oil and gas companies are starting to crack down on emissions of methane, a potent climate pollutant that frequently leaks and vents from fossil fuel operations.

The Global Methane Pledge brought 150 countries behind a pact to shave methane pollution 30 percent below 2020 levels during this decade. Satellites that can detect enormous plumes are proliferating, offering a way to track the emissions from oil fields and remote transportation infrastructure. And new regulations in the U.S., South America and Europe are taking force, prompting oil and gas companies to partner with third-party firms to stomp out leaks.

“It's a huge multiplier effect to avoid methane emissions or to quickly stop them,” Gordon said. “That is the race that we are on now.”

But it’s a race that veterans of the climate talks admit the world is in danger of losing. Even in the U.S., whose delegation will travel to Dubai touting last year's massive climate law, activists have been angered by Biden's approval of the Alaskan oil project and his failure to halt new lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico.

Those actions have emboldened other countries, particularly developing nations with undeveloped oil and gas reserves, to press for the chance to tap their own fossil fuel resources — which will be a major theme undergirding the Dubai talks.

“Unfortunately, a number of countries are going in the wrong direction” on fossil fuel production if the world is to combat climate change, said David Waskow, director of the World Resources Institute’s international climate initiative. “We’re clearly doing expansion of oil and gas.”

"Google DeepMindのCEO、デミス・ハサビスはこれまで、人工知能（AI）は大きな飛躍を遂げると公言してはばからなかった人物だ。中でも特に彼を有名にしたのは、2016年「AlphaGo」に囲碁を自己学習させ、超人間的なスキルと創意工夫あふれるプレイをできるようにしたことだ。

グーグルのAIモデル「Gemini」がリリースされた12月6日（米国時間）、ハサビスは自身が率いるグーグルのチームは大きな前進を遂げたと語った。それは、彼自身にとっても、会社にとっても、そして願わくはより広いAI分野にとっても大きな一歩であることが期待される。Geminiは、AIにおける前人未到の道を切り拓くものであり、新たな大躍進につながる可能性があると彼は考えている。

「コンピューター科学者であると同時に神経科学者として、わたしは何年も前から、新世代のAIモデルと呼べるようなものに挑戦し、作り上げたいと考えてきました。それは、わたしたちが自分のあらゆる感覚を通して世界と関わり合い、理解する方法から発想されたAIモデルです」と、ハサビスはリリースに先立ち、『WIRED』に語った。Geminiは「そのようなモデルに向けた大きな一歩」であるという。グーグルはGeminiのことを「マルチモーダル」と表現する。テキスト、音声、画像、および動画形式の情報を処理できるためだ。

Geminiの初期バージョンは、すでにグーグルのチャットボット「Bard」を通じて利用可能だ。同社によると、このモデルの最も強力なバージョンであるGemini Ultraは来年のリリースが予定されており、いくつかの一般的なベンチマークにおいてChatGPTの背後にあるモデル「GPT-4」を上回るという。グーグルが公開したビデオでは、Geminiが複雑な論理的思考を必要とするタスクを解決する様子や、テキスト、画像、音声、動画から取得した情報を組み合わせて処理する事例が紹介されている。

「これまでのほとんどのモデルは、別々のモジュールを訓練し、それらをつなぎ合わせることでマルチモーダルを近似するようなものでした」と、ハサビスは言う。遠回しにOpen AIの技術のことを指しているようだ。「それでも問題ないタスクはあるでしょう。しかしそれでは、異なる種類の情報が存在する場での、深くて複雑な論理的思考はできません」

OpenAIは9月にChatGPTのアップグレード版をリリースし、テキストに加えて画像や音声でも情報を入力できるようにした。それを実現させているGPT-4のマルチモーダル能力の技術基盤について、OpenAIは技術的な詳細を開示していない。

遅れを取り戻す

Geminiの開発とリリースは、グーグルのこれまでのAIプロジェクトと比べ、著しくスピードが速かった。最近、OpenAIなどの開発する製品がグーグルの将来にとって脅威となる可能性が懸念されており、それに後押しされた形だ。

2022年末時点では、グーグルは大手テック企業の中でもAIのリーダー的存在と見なされ、同社のAI研究者たちはこの分野に大きな貢献を果たしていた。CEOのスンダー・ピチャイは同社の戦略として「AIファースト」を宣言しており、グーグルは検索からスマートフォンに至るまで、多くの自社製品にAIを追加することに成功していた。

やがて、スタッフ800人弱の風変わりなスタートアップ、OpenAIがChatGPTをリリースすると、グーグルはもはやAIにおける第ひとり者とは見なされなくなった。人間を超えているとも思える賢さであらゆる種類の質問に答えるChatGPTの能力は、グーグルが誇る検索エンジンに取って代わるのではないかという見通しを生んだ。特に、OpenAIの出資者であるマイクロソフトが、ChatGPTの基盤技術を自社の検索エンジンBingに組み込んだことで、その見通しはさらに強まった。

危機感に突き動かされたグーグルは、ChatGPTの対抗馬となるBardのリリースを急ぎ、検索エンジンを刷新した。また、ChatGPTを背後で支えるモデルに対抗するため、新たなモデル「PaLM 2」も急いで発表した。ハサビスは当時、グーグルが自らのスタートアップDeepMindを買収した際、ロンドンに設立したAI研究所を率いる立場にいたが、そのチームがグーグルの主要AI研究グループGoogle Brainと統合され、新たなAI部門のトップに昇進した。",technology

So there's, I'm excited to share the stage

with some distinguished space experts as we look to,

as we look to space, there's a lot happening right now,

and there's a lot on the horizon as well.

We have, as we look up to Earth orbit

and the Moon and Mars and asteroids

and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and beyond,

there's a lot coming up.

There's also stuff to be concerned about too

when it comes to environmental and ethical questions,

labor problems, political tensions.

So there's a lot to think about, but I,

what I always try to do when I approach these issues

is think about how can we make space safe,

sustainable, and egalitarian?

And those themes will come up today.

So I, let's bring on our guests.

I'll introduce them as they come up.

We have Ariel Ekblaw,

[audience applauding]

the

[audience applauding]

CEO, or the founder of the Space,

MIT Space Exploration Initiative

and author of Anthropocosmos,

which is an excellent title, I think.

And she's also working on

self-assembling space structures, among other things.

We have Jared Isaacman,

who is the CEO of Shift4 Payments.

He's also, was, led the inspiration for space flight,

the first commercial space flight into orbit.

And he's a benevolent space billionaire

promoting science there.

And as well as on Polaris Dawn,

which is coming up very soon,

which will include the first commercial spacewalk.

We also have Karen Nyberg, recently retired NASA astronaut,

and she's been to the International Space Station,

of course, multiple times.

And she's also a textile artist

and brought her art supplies to the Station as well.

And also Moriba Jah, who is a space environmentalist

and space debris guru at UT Austin.

And actually, I first wanted

to direct the first question to you.

As, as we -

Wow. Okay.

And, we can, and everyone else feel free to chime in.

But just starting with Earth orbit,

when in low Earth orbit we have, you know,

the debris problem and a space traffic problem,

which is persistent and getting worse.

Why is that?

And you know, can you,

can you tell us more about the problem?

What can be done?

Yeah.

I mean, look, I don't know if people here

really realize this.

And you can see all this stuff on, like,

this app called Wayfinder.

If you Google Wayfinder and space debris,

you'll find it.

But basically in 1957,

we launched our first satellite Sputnik.

And right now, in 2023,

we're tracking over 50,000 objects ranging in size

from your cell phone all the way to the Space Station.

Out of which, you know, 5,000, over five,

just a little bit over 5,000 are working satellites

that are providing services and capabilities

like communication, position, navigation, and timing.

Everything else is garbage.

So like 90% of all the stuff we're tracking is trash.

And out of the about 5,000 satellites that are working,

over half of those belong to Elon Musk, so.

Look, I'm just, it's just facts.

I'm not, there's no judgment there.

[audience laughing]

It's true.

And Karen, I wanted to ask you about what are your thoughts

on the role of science in, in space?

'Cause at the beginning, at the beginning of the Space Race,

it was a lot, there was a lot of,

it was basically a race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.

and science was taking a backseat.

And, now we have sort of, there's the rivalry between

the U.S. and China as well that sort of casts a shadow

in a way, on Moon exploration for one thing.

So what are your thoughts on

how science fits into all of this?

Well, I think certainly science is,

has been and will be, you know,

one of the fundamental drivers for space exploration.

I personally think one of the problems we have

is that a lot of the science can be very abstract

for those that aren't intimately involved with it.

And I think it can be challenging to find a connection

for the general public to understand, you know,

what the science is doing for them.

And I think in the future, to make, to make science

continue to be that fundamental driver,

I think it's important for those of us

that are flying in space and,

and exploring to make it a tangible,

a tangible thing for people.

And also I think science is also very good

at fostering collaboration.

But that being said, I think it's also important

that there's other things.

And sometimes it's the, sometimes it's the competition,

that really works to get things going.

And then we get science out of that

that we're not expecting.

You know, we don't, we don't know what we're gonna find.

That's one of the beauties of science.

And then also, I think space exploration needs to be,

that there's the human aspect of it that is so important

and the inspirational aspect of it that really needs to,

to come into play and then science comes out of it.

Absolutely.

Jared, I wanted to ask you, in what ways are,

would you say that commercial space flight

is expanding access to space?

And what more can be done in that way?

Yeah, I mean, I mean, first I could just go right

to the heart of it with reusability.

I mean, it's kind of hard to imagine that on your,

you know, flight to take the family down to Disney World,

you would throw the 737 away.

And, you know, reusability is a total game changer, right?

I mean, no one's arguing that accessing space

isn't still very expensive.

It, it certainly is,

but the costs have come down materially, right?

So much so that it, it's not just, you know,

that commercial, you know, space astronaut missions

are now taking place more routinely.

You actually have nations

that are sending up their astronauts in orbit

that previously never would've been able to do that

right now.

I mean, those, you know, I think Axiom's a great example

of that right now, that, you know, if you're,

if you're not of, you know, sufficient resources

to contribute into either NASA

or the European Space Agency, you were on the sidelines.

So, you know, reusability has changed the game entirely

for, in terms of opening up space for,

for more humans to go out and explore.

But also even just, you know,

commercial payload missions right now,

you can experiment so much more

with the different satellites or other payloads

that you're putting into space that previously,

at when, when the costs were in order of magnitude greater,

you had to be certain.

And this experimentation phase,

who knows what possibilities it'll create in the future, so.

That's a good point.

Ariel, what I'd like to ask you,

what would you say or what are your thoughts

on the role of artificial intelligence and robotics

in space flight and how astronauts

and autonomous systems might end up working together?

So I think that we'll see them be deeply coupled.

The role of robotics already is really well known

in space flight.

Of course we have Mars rovers,

we have probes that are autonomous

that go and help us explore beyond the reaches

of where we could currently send humans.

But now, even within the realm of human space flight,

my team at MIT and my lab at Aurelia,

we're already looking at integrating AI agents.

So, you know, a, maybe embodied personal agent

behind Chat GPT into the construction

and the operation of a responsive space habitat.

Part of this is because in the future,

instead of thinking about space habitats and life in space

as a domain where it's just about survival,

which it has certainly been until recently,

we're at this inflection point,

we can begin to think about thriving in space,

designing space architecture that is welcoming

to more of the public

that doesn't just look like a science lab on orbit.

And so to be able to do that,

we need responsive space habitats,

really capable integration of all kinds

of different systems.

And AI will have a huge role in that.

And then, personally, Ramin knows,

my passion is around robotics for self-assembly.

So it's all well and good if the costs dropped, you know,

drastically tomorrow to get humans to space.

We only have room for seven of them in orbit, period.

You know, 11 if you count Tiangong.

And that means that we actually have just a need

for more real estate in orbit.

And I think one of the best ways

that we can get to that is robotic self-assembly.

Imagine Legos building themselves in space.

My personal love is to do that with magnets.

But there's all kinds of different ways

you can achieve that future

and try to actually scale up in space construction,

so it's no longer dependent on just astronaut EVAs

when they go in suits outside or robotic arms.

So, this is a question for any of you,

are there upcoming space missions

or new technologies over the next couple years

that you're really looking forward to?

I have a couple, if I can pop right back in.

Sure, go for it.

To your comments earlier about the importance of science,

I think there's two fantastic opportunities

on the near term horizon to appreciate investment in space

for the benefit of life on Earth.

I think that there is a real need to balance.

Many of us, I'm sure have a space dream of, you know,

we're not really, wanna die on Mars,

but we would love to go to Mars.

But there's much more proximate benefit in orbit

for space science coming right back down

to benefit life on Earth.

Two great examples.

I think biotech will be an anchor customer

of future space stations.

One for novel drug discovery.

We already know that proteins fold

differently in microgravity.

Something NASA's been working on for many years on the ISS,

but we're finally seeing, you know,

pharma industry actually engage with the design

of a bio-station so that they could actually produce

novel drugs on orbit.

And then my second favorite example, artificial retinas.

Nicole Wagner, LambdaVision,

a founder who I'm really enamored with currently.

She's designing a new protein matrix

to create artificial retinas.

You can only do it in space.

You can't make artificial retinas on Earth in the same way.

Gravity kind of ruins the process.

And then they're able to bring the retinas back

and potentially cure macular degeneration.

So, I just think a really fantastic example

of the use of space for the benefit of life on Earth.

If I could just jump on every,

I love everything you've just said

in both your answers, by the way.

And I think, just for the benefit of the group,

first, just on the whole AI point right now,

I don't know if people appreciate,

you see like four people in a space capsule,

there's an army back on Mission Control, an army.

Like the entire operations of human space flight

is managed very much here on Earth.

When you get to 20 minute transmission delays,

if we're gonna get anywhere near Mars,

and that's communicating at the speed of light,

that doesn't work.

So you're gonna have to evolve to a system

with very, very smart technology on the vehicle itself

that can make decisions when you're going like,

you know, greater than eight kilometers a second.

And robotics absolutely on that.

And the second point, which I love even more,

is what is the economy that even requires us to be in space?

'Cause we don't have an answer for that yet, right?

You've got a vehicle on the horizon right now

that could be the 737 of human space flight,

with factories that could potentially create

hundreds of these vehicles

that each fit a hundred people in it.

And we don't know why they need to be there yet.

So, actually having a space economy,

which is pretty foundational

in almost every good sci-fi movie,

you know, whether it's the spices to fuel jump drives

or something like that, we don't have that figured out yet.

And it would be great if it's something as,

as noble, as important as restoring potentially eyesight

or other bio-manufacturing type capabilities.

Anyway, just awesome stuff.

Thanks.

Yeah.

For me, in terms of technologies,

I'm gonna bring it more towards environmentalism

and, and safety and sustainability.

And, I think to Jared's point,

this idea of reusability and recyclability,

right now we have a linear economy in space,

it's like the end state of every satellite

is to become junk.

It's kind of like single use plastics,

it's single use satellites and it's BS.

So we need to change that.

We need to have a circular space economy

that focuses first and foremost on prevention of pollution,

prioritizing reusability and recyclability.

And then for the things that have to be, you know,

single use, we have to come up with mechanisms

for proper disposal.

And so I think the technology to go

and do active debris removal,

there's still a lot to do there, so.

That's a good point.

There's a couple of missions coming up,

that I'll be writing about too for Wired

about debris removal and the,

and speaking of removing things from orbit,

there's the, a new FAA rule is coming out,

which will basically require U.S. companies

to make sure that, you know, rocket, rocket bodies

are disposed of instead of becoming

big barges in the ocean of plastic as it were.

Since Mars is in the theme of this session,

I feel like I have to ask a Mars question.

Do any of you have thoughts on what Mars exploration,

say in 2050 or so, what it could look like

or what it should look like?

I mean, look, from my perspective,

I just don't think that Homo sapiens is the species

to, like, thrive on other celestial bodies.

I think that we evolved as Earthlings,

smelling flowers, having pets, cats, you know,

fish and all that other stuff.

We didn't evolve, like, in submarines and crap like that.

So to me, all these movies about,

oh, we're gonna have these really cool, you know,

flight suits and live in bubbles perpetually

is, is bullshit.

Like, that's just not realistic.

So I think that the next hominid,

I'm gonna call it Homo machina,

which is like a fusion of humans and machines,

those will be able to withstand larger radiation doses,

stay in space for hundreds of years

to do interstellar whatever.

Like, I think the next hominid will be able to do that.

But I think that we still need to explore,

to basically develop the technology

to help the next hominid species be able to thrive

elsewhere in the universe.

That's a fascinating perspective.

I really like that.

[Karen laughing]

That's, yeah, I think, I think for living on Mars,

you know, the exploring and going there, there's so many,

after having lived in space for six months,

there's so many logistics just of storing food.

I mean, we have cargo vehicles coming several times a year,

bringing spare parts, food, you know, whatever we need.

And just, there's logistically just humans living.

And then the time delay for having, you know,

like Jared said, we have the Mission Control

that is basically running Space Station

and you have to figure out how to do that without that.

And, so there's, there's so much.

I would great, love to see it in the next 25 years,

but I don't know, I'm not sure.

Yeah, that may be unrealistic.

Yeah.

I think a couple things that I love to call out

about this prospect of human civilization on Mars.

One little fun fact is it's one third G,

we're not sure if a woman could carry a baby to term

in one third G.

It's a big open question.

So whether, you know, an outpost on Mars is replacing itself

or constantly having to be replaced by Earth.

Big open question as to what, you know,

that future kind of looks like.

And then Moriba has hit on some of the other challenges.

There's poison in the soil,

there's perchlorates in the soil,

so it's not gonna be like The Martian movie.

You're not gonna be growing potatoes in that direct soil.

You're gonna need a lot of other infrastructure

to be able to achieve a sustainable vision on Mars.

But, even before we get to Homo machina,

which I love that concept,

I do think that there is something really profound

about that human search for knowledge

and the meaning of going out and exploring.

There's a great quote from Apollo 8,

I think it was Bill Anders who said,

when they took the first photo of the Earth from space

on their way to the moon,

We came all this way to explore the moon.

And what we discovered was Earth.

And it really does expand our circles of awareness

as a species.

And so I think it's worth doing,

even when we are still very fragile,

odd little biological bags of water

to actually be able to explore

what life could be like on Mars

as long as we take care of Earth at the meantime.

It should not be an abandoning Earth

or a moral hazard type of approach at all.

I literally agree with what everybody has said up here.

Look, there's, I don't, I don't think anyone

is under the illusion that Mars is gonna be a better,

a better planet than Earth.

All these, rich billionaires can't wait.

We already destroyed Earth, can't wait to get to Mars.

It's not gonna be great there.

[all laughing]

There is a lot of problems with this

and there are no analogs on Earth.

Zero.

Despite what people may think.

There is nothing about it.

Going to Antarctica, you can, you can come back,

you know, during the Age of Exploration you go over,

you discover a new continent.

Deer is deer, you chop wood down, you fish,

it's all relatively the same.

No matter how hard you work on Mars,

you're destined to be in a bubble for forever.

And there are all the issues described

along the journey, right?

I mean, sure, certainly childbirth is,

we've never done an open surgery in space.

There are immense psychological issues

you couldn't even begin to imagine.

I mean, there's psychological issues

when you're 90 minutes from coming back to Earth,

or two or three days coming back from the Moon

versus six to nine months.

So, I think, I think that what it comes down to is

for the first time in human history,

it is now within the realm of possible to get there.

And when you get there,

you're gonna learn an awful lot along the way.

And who knows how that could alter, you know,

human's destiny here on Earth.

Whether it's the technology we develop,

or it's new sources of power that we might uncover,

or that we just simply have to do it

because others will try and do it.

And if they do it, I mean, throughout all of human history,

the high ground has been very important.

Believe me.

That is, that is the high ground.

And we appreciate that in low Earth orbit

and we will in Lunar, and certainly in Mars.

So there's a lot of reasons why we still have to do it.

Also, moving a little closer in time and distance,

how about the Moon where we have,

in the next, say 20 years, there may be a NASA outpost,

a NASA and its partners

as well as a Lunar space station.

There'll be a Chinese research station

and there could be, you know,

commercial tourists at least orbiting if not landing.

So like what, what is this future that,

like what do you think of this future

is of Moon exploration?

I'm frankly excited that we're get getting now closer

to the point where we're actually doing that.

I mean, I'll tell you, when I became an astronaut in 2000,

I literally thought that I would have a good chance

of going to the Moon then.

And you know, 23 years have passed

and we haven't been back.

And so now with the Artemis program

and what some commercial companies are doing,

I think it's, you know, it's now finally in the realm.

And that is a great place to learn some more

without traveling quite so far as going to Mars.

And there is still so much to learn.

So I'm really excited about seeing

what comes of that over the next decade or two.

The dynamics of getting there

are also changing drastically.

So about a year and a half ago I signed MIT's

first ever commercial contract to go to the Moon.

We didn't wait in a pipeline for NASA.

We didn't have to sign on

for a purely scientific experimental,

although we are doing two payloads.

We bought our way onto a mission with a commercial provider,

which NASA has done a really fantastic job

of incubating this CLPS program,

Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.

And next spring, if everything goes well,

we'll actually be on the surface

with two different payloads.

And this is a remarkable speed-up

of access to that environment.

So I think that that is something to keep in mind,

is that it's becoming much more accessible to get there.

What that raises is a really interesting set of questions

about first precedence for first actors that get there,

principles that we're seeding it with.

And there's been some really interesting reports

that have come out of the Harvard Center for Astrophysics.

Most of the resources that we're really interested in,

the water, ice,

the really dark black sky for good astronomy, helium-3,

they're concentrated in the same small areas.

China knows that too.

India knows that too.

And so we are potentially setting up

a geopolitical tension area on the Moon

if we don't think ahead about some of the principles

and the norms of behavior that we wanna see

before a gold rush essentially sets in for the Moon

now that this access is so much more available.

Yeah, no, I totally see, agree on everything said.

I totally see the geopolitical tension rising.

You know, for me being on the Moon is kind of like,

equivalent to, like scuba diving

in the sense that you put on the suit, you go,

you check out the fish, it's cool,

you come back kind of thing.

So the ability to go, come back,

I think that makes a lot of sense.

I think, for most people it won't matter unless, you know,

somebody like Disney takes over

and then starts, like, getting people there.

But before people jump on that long Disney ride,

let me just say this, okay.

'Cause people keep on talking about,

oh, you know, just go to space, space tourism.

If you get on one of these flights,

just regular flights on a 737 whatever,

and you've experienced turbulence

and you're like, Ah, it's kind of bumpy.

17 hours kind of sucks on a plane.

Let me tell you, you have embraced the suck.

'Cause this whole thing about going to the Moon

is like totally, yeah, people go, Oh yeah,

my grandmother's just gonna walk on a rocket and just like.

That's not gonna happen anytime soon.

So I think people need to be a little bit more realistic

with the challenges.

And living in space is not glamorous.

Yeah I, first, completely agree.

I mean look, half of all astronauts get

Space Adaptation Syndrome.

It's not a pretty 48 hours.

So when they talk about the 737 of human space flight

and a hundred people, 50 people are throwing up

and the other 50 people are pretty unhappy

that they are throwing up.

[audience laughing]

So I'm totally, I'm totally with you.

But look, the more times we're going into space

and the more we uncover,

the more problems we're gonna be able to solve along the way

for being in space and also back here on Earth.

I do wanna just say, in terms of the Moon, right?

And I know it's not, it's not the great answer

because everybody wants everyone to play nice.

But look, the competition is good.

It's really good.

And right now our means to go to space or, I'm sorry,

the, the game plan for the U.S. to the Moon

is a four and a half billion dollar disposable rocket.

And competition, first of all brings down costs,

competition fuels innovation.

And we are not the only ones that,

that want to get to the Moon right now.

This is a big deal.

As long as space is super expensive,

you could go to the Moon

and then we don't go back for 50 years.

And that's what happened before.

I personally want my kids to grow up in an environment

where people are on the Moon all the time

and we're uncovering great things that, again,

change and make our lives a lot more interesting.

Competition is good.

China is certainly looking to go there on the fast track.

You have other countries looking to do it.

I think it'll force the U.S. to kind of reevaluate

how it looks at space exploration.

I think that's good for all humankind.

Yeah.

So the last thing that I wanna say, like, back to the whole,

'cause I'd love to see people just thriving on the Moon

all the time.

I think it's a great time to start thinking about

becoming an anesthesiologist.

'Cause you're gonna wanna be knocked out.

Like what kind of cocktail can I just, like,

you put me on the rocket, get put to sleep,

wake me up when I get there, kind of thing, right?

It's like, yeah.

I found most flight surgeons are anesthesiologists.

Okay.

So lastly, but before we go, is there anything else

that people maybe haven't thought enough about

as far as space or things that you think

people should think about more?

Yeah, I think, I think the main thing for me,

look, to me, space, we came from the stars,

we need to go back kind of thing.

I think you can see the natural progression.

You know, we explored, you know, land, ocean, air.

It's always been preceded

by those that have most resources, right?

You know, the billionaires, the kings and queens.

Then it became a common mode of transportation.

So I think seeing that billionaires are going into space

should signal to everybody,

it's gonna be a common mode of transportation

to the rest of humanity because the evidence shows that.

However, I think that we as a humanity

have forgotten about the

interconnectedness amongst all things.

We've forgotten what stewardship means

and what I, what I don't wanna see is us take

the toxicity that currently exists

and propagate that across the universe.

Like there's a, there's a way to not do that.

Yeah.

Yeah.

We think about some of the same themes at MIT,

this notion of the Anthropocosmos.

So a little bit of a tongue twister,

but building on this notion of the Anthropocene,

having been a period of Earth's history where,

for better or for worse,

humanity has now become a really dominant player.

For the Earth, I think it's for better.

I'm a very happy human.

But as we move out into the near neighborhood

of our solar system,

we have a responsibility to the space commons.

And I think Moriba phrases it really beautifully,

and I'm really inspired by his work

because he's an example of someone

who is very actively helping us be a better steward

of the space commons.

But one of the things, the frameworks,

a mental framework that we could develop

is this notion of urban planning at planetary scale.

Everything from space debris, which is waste management,

to electromagnetic spectrum sharing, which is utilities,

to the sharing of different orbits.

And how do we make sure that we don't have forts

and garrisons in low Earth orbit,

but we actually have, you know, free travel

between the different space stations of all the nations.

There's about to be a really remarkable inflection point

as we scale up humanity's presence in space

on this cusp of interplanetary civilization.

And I think it's worth thinking about

in a systems manner of thinking,

like urban planning at planetary scale.

Well, we'll have to leave it there.

I think that's a good point to end on.

Thank you all, all of you.

And let's hopefully live together on,

in space instead of dying.

"Mr. Blinken said on Thursday that Israel has taken some positive steps, including by “evacuating neighborhoods instead of entire cities,” creating safe areas and “having a more narrowly focused area of where this military operation is actually being conducted.”

Israeli officials argue that they are in an impossible position, fighting an enemy in Hamas that embeds itself among civilians and that, they charge, seeks to maximize Palestinian deaths to make Israel appear cruel to the world. Israeli leaders say that even as they often take unusual steps to warn civilians about impending attacks, they cannot defeat a fanatical enemy in a dense urban area without great collateral damage.

But in Washington and at the United Nations, Arab diplomats expressed anger at Israel’s renewed offensive, which U.S. officials concede is again incurring casualties at a high rate and adding to Gaza’s humanitarian crisis. Those diplomats — from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority — met with Mr. Blinken at the State Department on Friday afternoon. Turkey’s foreign minister also joined the visiting group, the Arab-Islamic Ministerial Committee.

And on Capitol Hill, some Democrats say the United States must move beyond talk to pressure Israel. “I do think the Biden administration can be doing more to exercise our leverage under these circumstances,” Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said. “When words are not matched by strong actions, the United States looks feckless.”

“The Biden administration should call for a pause” in Israel’s military campaign, he added, “until it receives a verifiable plan of action to secure the objectives that the president has put out and that the secretary of state has described as ‘imperative.’”",political
"The house in New Jersey came with a menagerie of control panels. Pallid little rectangles with fuzzy LCD screens, of varying brands and designs. Some were decades old, and there were six of them in total, dotted around various rooms. Joe Truncale, a customer engineer at Google, remembers trying to get his head around the system when he moved in two years ago.

Each thermostat had a piece of paper sticky-taped to it, with a helpful scribble from the previous homeowner explaining how to operate the gadget. Not exactly an intuitive user experience. And it wasn’t economical, either. In one area the heating was running constantly. Truncale balked at the idea of trying to fine-tune each of the fiddly little thermostats. “That’s when I started to think … maybe I build my own,” he says.

So, in a quest for control, he ripped them all out. It wasn’t long until he had built a smartphone app and hooked up a device to his gas furnace that allowed him to control the delivery of hot water to his heaters remotely. Temperature sensors replaced the old thermostats. These tracked the temperature in various rooms and sent that data along wires running inside the walls back to a central hub. With some programming and scheduling, Truncale soon had a system that managed the heating more or less automatically.

He called it ThermOS and made the code open source. “It’s been going since February of 2021,” he says. “I haven’t touched it in over a year. I haven’t made a code change.”

Most people, no matter their skill set, know what it’s like to do battle with a heating system, to wrestle with a thermostat. But even if you don’t want to build your own, there are ways of mastering these gadgets. This is how to make your thermostat work for you—and not the other way round.

Hot Enough for You?

For many, the biggest decision is what room temperature to choose when you’re at home. Many people prefer warmth in excess of 21 degrees Celsius, but, unsurprisingly, the higher you go, the more money you’ll spend. The World Health Organization suggests 18 degrees as a minimum in temperate climates. “I did it myself,” says Jo Alsop, founder of the British independent advisory body The Heating Hub. “I got used to a house that was around 18 to 18.5 degrees.”

Turning the room temperature down is one of the best ways of lowering your utility bill, suggests Katy King at Nesta, an innovation-focused charity in the UK. She and colleagues have compared the potential savings from turning your thermostat down by 1 degree (from 20 to 19 degrees Celsius) with reducing the time you heat your home for by five hours every week. The 1-degree change could save £100 ($126) on an annual bill in the UK, she estimates, whereas reducing heating time only saves £12 across the year.

“It really surprised me when we did this research,” says King. “It’s heating to a higher temperature that really makes a bigger difference.”",technology
"The holiday season is here, but software firms are still busy issuing fixes for major security flaws. Microsoft, Google, and enterprise software firm Atlassian have released patches for vulnerabilities already being used in attacks. Cisco also patched a bug deemed so serious, it was given a near-maximum CVSS score of 9.9.

Here’s everything you need to know about the patches released in November.

Google Chrome

Google ended November with a bang after issuing seven security fixes for Chrome, including an emergency patch for an issue already being used in real-life attacks. Tracked as CVE-2023-6345, the already exploited flaw is an integer overflow issue in Skia, an open source 2D graphics library. “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2023-6345 exists in the wild,” the browser maker said in an advisory.

Little is known about the fix at the time of writing; however, it was reported by Benoît Sevens and Clément Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group, indicating the exploit could be spyware-related.

The six other flaws fixed by Google and rated as having a high impact include CVE-2023-6348, a type-confusion bug in Spellcheck, and CVE-2023-6351, a use-after-free issue in libavif.

Earlier in the month, Google released fixes for 15 security issues in its widely used browser. Among the bugs fixed by the software giant are three rated as having a high severity. Tracked as CVE-2023-5480, the first is an inappropriate implementation issue in Payments, while the second, CVE-2023-5482, is an insufficient data validation flaw in USB with a CVSS score of 8.8. The third high-severity bug, CVE-2023-5849, is an integer overflow issue in USB.

Mozilla Firefox

Chrome competitor Firefox has fixed 10 vulnerabilities in the browser, six of which are rated as having a high impact. CVE-2023-6204 is an out-of-bound memory access flaw in WebGL2 blitFramebuffer, while CVE-2023-6205 is a use-after-free issue in MessagePort.

Meanwhile, CVE-2023-6206 could allow clickjacking permission prompts using the full-screen transition. “The black fade animation when exiting full screen is roughly the length of the anti-clickjacking delay on permission prompts,” Firefox owner Mozilla said. “It was possible to use this fact to surprise users by luring them to click where the permission grant button would be about to appear.”

CVE-2023-6212 and CVE-2023-6212 are Memory safety bugs, both with a CVSS score of 8.8, in Firefox 120, Firefox ESR 115.5, and Thunderbird 115.5.

Google Android

Google's November Android Security Bulletin details fixes patched in this month, including eight in the Framework, six of which are elevation of privilege bugs. The worst flaw could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed, Google said in an advisory.

Google also fixed seven issues in the System, six of which are rated as having a high severity and one marked as critical. Tracked as CVE-2023-40113, the critical bug could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed.",technology
"Trump was off stage literally and figuratively for much of the fourth primary debate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was occasionally referenced and obliquely criticized, like when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis noted that Mexico had not — as Trump promised — paid for a border wall; or when former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said he was good on trade but bad on everything else related to China.

But, largely, he skated.

It wasn’t for lack of opportunity. Trump clearly impacted the debate without being there. The questions often were geared around him or the things he said, like a query about whether the fellow candidates would also want to repeal and replace Obamacare. The other presidential aspirants often found themselves discussing moments of Trump’s presidency without prompt: like when tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy insisted that the attacks on the capital on Jan. 6 were an “inside job.”

He remained the axis around which the debate spun, even without being on stage.

At the halfway point, moderator Megyn Kelly pressed the candidate’s specifically about Trump’s call for a Muslim ban. Haley didn’t criticize him, just said she would limit immigration without applying ideological screening. DeSantis then jumped in and took the opportunity to criticize Haley, not Trump.

Later, Christie again tried to re-orient the debate back to Trump, after he was asked about the former president’s comments, a day before, that he would be a dictator for a day to put in place his border and oil drilling policies.

“There is no mystery about what he wants to do,” Christie says of Trump. “This is an angry, bitter man.”

He once more called out the rest of the stage for “failing to speak out against” the former president. But found few takers.

Trump became the subject of a bitter exchange between him and DeSantis, who declined repeatedly to say whether he believed Trump was fit to serve. Instead, the Florida governor went after Trump on his age, noting that he could only serve four years and would, upon taking office again, be older than Joe Biden was when he was elected. “We need somebody who is younger.”

Ramaswamy says he wants to give guns to Taiwan

When asked about defending the lengths to which he would go to defend Taiwan, Ramaswamy said he thought the Taiwanese needed a second amendment.

“It worked in America, why wouldn’t it work in Taiwan?” he asked.

Christie, mockingly, shot down Ramaswamy’s suggestion, saying “you know, I don’t think we have constitutional authority over Taiwan to give them a second amendment.”

The U.S. has long supported Taiwan and its opposition to Chinese aggression in the region. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have spent billions to send military equipment to Taiwan with the expectation that Beijing may eventually try and attack.

All of the candidates, besides Christie, refused to answer whether they would go so far as sending American troops to defend Taiwan if China were to invade. Christie said he would.

DeSantis dodges on Obamacare

After Trump renewed his threat to repeal the Affordable Care Act — widely referred to as Obamacare — DeSantis said he would replace it with something better.

But on Wednesday night, he declined to detail exactly what his plan would include if elected, saying only that he intends to “go after the cost” of healthcare.

“Florida did not expand Obamacare,” he said, referring to the provision of the law that expanded Medicaid to more people. “I think the states that did that, I think are struggling financially so that yes, we declined to do that. And I don’t think that that was the right policy to do.”

Haley: TikTok is causing a rise in antisemitism

Haley took aim at the popular social media app TikTok when asked about the rise of antisemitism on college campuses.

“For every 30 minutes that someone watches TikTok every day, they become 17% more antisemitic, more pro-Hamas,” Haley claimed.

The statistic appeared to be drawn from a survey by Generation Lab that showed a relationship between antisemitic and anti-Israel views and how much time people under the age of 30 spend on TikTok, Instagram and X.

He brought signs

Ramaswamy and Haley snapped at one another — continuing a pattern that has played out in the previous three debates.

At one point, Ramaswamy picked up his notebook and waved it in the air, which said that “Nikki is corrupt,” referring to her money-making after she left the United Nations.

Ramaswamy also went after Haley for playing “identity politics,” noting that she had previously accused him of having a “woman problem” because of his attacks on her and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel.

“Nikki, I don’t have a woman problem,” he said.

Asked to respond, Haley remarked thusly: “No, it’s not worth my time to respond to him.”

DeSantis, Haley and Ramaswamy compete over trans youth restrictions

In response to questions about health care and bathroom usage by transgender minors, DeSantis and Haley sought to bash each other as not doing enough.

Haley criticized DeSantis for not campaigning on a so-called “bathroom bill” — legislation requiring people to use public restrooms that match their sex assigned at birth — when he ran for governor in 2018. DeSantis responded that he signed such a bill as governor. He also equated medical procedures for trans children to child abuse.

“As a parent, you do not have the right to abuse your kids,” he said.

Haley added her strong support for banning trans participation in sports, saying that “boys playing girl’s sports” is the “women’s rights issue of our time.”

Ramaswamy went a step further, arguing the federal government should threaten to withhold funds to blue states that continue to what he referred to as “chemical castration,” a reference to gender-affirming procedures that can impact fertility.

Christie on Trump: ‘There is no mystery to what he wants to do’

Christie continued to take the most aggressive stance on Trump from the stage and warned that the former president has been clear about what a second administration would look like. The former New Jersey governor was asked about Trump saying he would be a dictator for “one day” in order to seal the Southern border and enact mass deportations.

“Do I think he was kidding when he said he was a dictator? All you have to do is look at the history,” Christie said. But the crowd disagreed – and booed – when Christie said Trump doesn’t care for the American people. “It is Donald Trump first,” Christie said.

DeSantis, meanwhile, suggested Trump’s policy threats are more bark than bite.

“The media is making a big deal about what he’s said. I would remind people that is not how he governed. He didn’t even fire Dr. Fauci or Christopher Wray. He didn’t clean up the swamp. He said he was going to drain it, he did not drain it,” DeSantis said. “Some of these policies he ran on, I was cheering him on then, but he didn’t deliver it.”

DeSantis defends shooting people at the border; Ramaswamy points to mental health

Faced with questions about the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, DeSantis defended previous comments that he would shoot people crossing the border illegally if they were wearing backpacks. He compared the situation to what he faced while serving in Iraq.

He also made an oblique criticism of Trump, saying there would not be a problem if the border wall had been finished, something the former president emphasized as a campaign promise but never finished. (DeSantis did not mention Trump by name, however.)

Ramaswamy took a different tack, saying he would support using the military to secure the border but saying the solution must include addressing the “demand side of it” and broader questions of mental health.

Christie and Ramaswamy are mixing it up

The former New Jersey governor attacked the multimillionaire businessman, accusing him of persistently denying statements that he made earlier on the trail. Then Christie went after Ramaswamy in more personal ways.

“This is the fourth debate. The fourth debate that you would be voted in the first 20 minutes as the most obnoxious blowhard in America,” Christie said, referencing some of Ramaswamy’s attacks on Haley.

“We disagree about some issues,” Christie said, gesturing to Haley. “What we don’t disagree on is this is a smart, accomplished woman. You should stop insulting her.”

Ramaswamy swung back, referencing the “Bridgegate” scandal that tarred Christie’s career.

“Chris,” he said, “your version of foreign policy was closing a bridge from New Jersey to New York. So do everybody a favor, just walk yourself off that stage, enjoy a nice meal and get the hell out of this.”

Christie would send U.S. troops to Gaza

Christie was the only candidate on the stage to say that he would send American troops to the Middle East in order to find and recover American hostages held in Gaza.

“I would absolutely send American troops,” Christie said.

Christie was answering a question about the war between Hamas and Israel and the potential for the war spilling over to other countries in the region. The former New Jersey governor said he would send the troops in as long as the U.S. could ensure their safe return.

The Biden administration, which has for years attempted to drawback assets from the Middle East, has vowed not to send additional troops back to the region. Instead, the U.S. has continued to ratchet up its military support for Israel and has proposed additional aid packages to help support its Iron Dome.

Despite the billions of dollars the U.S. is spending to support Israel, DeSantis and Haley said it is not enough. Both dodged the moderators’ question about sending American forces.

Chris Christie: Say Trump’s name!

During his first time speaking, Christie criticized his debate competitors — and debate moderators — for not bringing up Trump or clearly denouncing his falsehoods and recent comments about being “dictator.”

“I’m looking at my watch now. We’re 17 minutes into this debate, and except for your little speech in the beginning, we’ve had these three acting as if the race is between the four of us. The fifth guy who doesn’t have the guts to show up and stand here, he’s the one as you just put it is way ahead in the polls,” said Christie.

Christie said Ramaswamy, Haley and DeSantis treated Trump like the Harry Potter villain Voldemort, whose name was forbidden from being spoken. The former New Jersey governor suggested they were afraid to take on Trump, whom he called a “bully,” directly and speak the truth because they have “future aspirations.”

“I’m in this race because the truth needs to be spoken. This is a guy who said this past week he wants to use the Department of Justice to go after his enemies when he gets in there. The fact of the matter is he’s unfit to be president. There’s no bigger issue in this race than Donald Trump and those numbers prove it,” Christie said.

Haley defends herself on social media verification

Haley insisted that she never said she would require social media companies to authenticate people before they can post on their apps, saying instead that she wants social media companies to “show us their algorithms.”

Except she did: “Every person on social media should be verified by their name,” she had said earlier this fall. But amid criticism she quickly walked it back and focused instead on the algorithm remark.

It’s something that she received criticism from DeSantis and others, who said her proposal ran afoul of the First Amendment.

Haley pressed on private earnings and paid speeches

The former U.N. ambassador, who has recently surged into second place in some polls, faced an opening question about her corporate board memberships and ties to Wall Street — after DeSantis had already gone after her in his opening remarks, singling her out as not conservative enough.

In response, Haley touted her recent endorsement from Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-linked group that opted to back her over DeSantis, as well as her conservative record.

From her account on X, Haley’s campaign tweeted the following right as she was answering the question: “I opposed the Wall Street bailouts when many Republicans supported them. I tell donors what I believe. They don’t tell me.”

After she finished Ramaswamy attacked her for the news that broke this week that prominent Democratic donor Reid Hoffman had given $250,000 to her allied super PAC.

Hoffman, he said, “is effectively George Soros Jr.”",political
"Of all the layoffs happening at Spotify this week, this has to be the biggest. Chief financial officer Paul Vogel, who since 2020 has managed the company’s balance sheet as it expanded into podcasting and audiobooks, is leaving the company at the end of March 2024.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the decision was made because Vogel didn’t have the experience needed to help the company both expand and meet market expectations. The company is starting the search for a successor.

“Spotify has embarked on an evolution over the last two years to bring our spending more in line with market expectations while also funding the significant growth opportunities we continue to identify. I’ve talked a lot with Paul about the need to balance these two objectives carefully. Over time, we’ve come to the conclusion that Spotify is entering a new phase and needs a CFO with a different mix of experiences. As a result, we’ve decided to part ways, but I am very appreciative of the steady hand Paul has provided in supporting the expansion of our business through a global pandemic and unprecedented economic uncertainty,” Ek said in a statement published Thursday evening. Vogel did not issue a statement.

After testing investors’ patience with acquisitions and investments, Spotify is focusing on producing a profit, for better or worse. Much of its original podcasting operation has shuttered, including the cancellation this week of its two most prestigious shows, Heavyweight and Stolen. Approximately 1,500 people this week were laid off from product, advertising, marketing, and content, amounting to 17 percent of its staff.

Vogel is a longtime Spotify employee, joining the company in 2016 as the head of FP&A, treasury, and investor relations before being promoted to CFO in 2020. Prior to that, he had been a managing director at Barclay’s and an SVP at AllianceBernstein.",technology

History

TechRadar was launched by Future PLC in 2008 with a team based mostly in the UK, plus a couple of overseas writers to spot breaking stories while we slept. It quickly grew to become the UK's biggest consumer technology site, a position it still holds to this day.

It soon became time to go global, so we expanded to the US in April 2012 with a dedicated American team hired in what were then Future PLC's San Francisco and New York City offices.

In October 2012, TechRadar launched in Australia, with the site again leveraging Future PLC's existing presence in Sydney to hire a local team that has grown steadily in size over the following years. It is now one of the country’s leading tech sites.

We began the TechRadar Awards program in 2015, and are proud to recognize and award the companies we think are deserving of your applause each and every year. Check out our TechRadar Choice Awards 2022 page to find out about last year’s winners.

We'll run 31 miles with four watches strapped on to see if the numbers really do add up. We'll plug ourselves into motion capture to see how games are really made. We constantly talk to the biggest names in tech to find out what's really going on.

And we do it because we're just like you: gadget fans who just want to know what's going on and getting the best out of their tech.

How we test

We pride ourselves on our independence and our rigorous review-testing process, offering up long-term attention to the products we review and making sure our reviews are constantly updated and maintained - regardless of when a device was released, if you can still buy it, it's on our radar.

We have assembled a global team of some of the finest technology journalists on the planet, who are not only experts in their field, but are the same people we write our reviews for: those who want to know about and use the latest and best technology.

This is our promise to you:

We do not take payment for product reviews. Ever.

We select products for review based on what we believe our readers want to know.

We'll tell you what we think, not what advertisers want you to hear.

We say it as we see it. Our expert reviewers love technology and want you to love it too. If it's rubbish, we'll warn you off.

If a product doesn't meet our high standards, we'll tell you why.

We'll test products in real life, with a minimum acceptable number of days of testing required before we write our reviews to ensure every product is thoroughly tested.

If you think we're not living up to our promise, please email the Editor-in-Chief and we'll endeavor to put it right.

Our five star scoring system

We use a familiar five-star scoring system, in order to keep things recognizable and simple: the more stars, the better.

We rate our products on a number of criteria depending on the specific attributes of a product type, and we add a score out of 5 for each.

It's not just our website that we use to connect with our readers - we publish all our great analysis, insight and up-to-the-minute reviews to our millions of fans across multiple platforms.

Why trust us?

Editorial independence

No outside party determines the products we cover, review and place in our buying guides. The content of our editorial articles remains entirely independent. Nothing that has a star rating has been paid for.

Our editorial independence is backed by the weight of one of the world's largest technology publishers, Future PLC, which means we can tell you what we think of a product, without fear or favor.

We sometimes take trips and hospitality to attend shows and see products, in order to bring you instant coverage of the latest products. We never let it affect our judgement or response to a product, but it can sometimes be the only way we are able to bring you coverage of a new product, device or service.

While we purchase some products we review, we often use company's loan programs. Again, we're not going to pull any punches if the device just isn't good enough for our readers - we always seek to make sure that the review unit we get is representative of what you'll be able to buy, but we're here to help you and this is often the only way to get our hands on something before it goes on sale.

We always return products at the request of the brand or at the end of the agreed loan period.

"As much as we love high-priced tech like graphics cards, monitors, or the latest handheld PC , most of us can't spend several hundred dollars on a tech gift or purchase. But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your tech-focused friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money.



I own most of the affordable tech gifts in this list below, nearly all of which can be had for $50 or less. OK, one is currently slightly more than $50, but there's a good chance it could be back on sale for less by the time you read this. I can honestly say that these products have made (or would make) my nerdy world a little nicer in their own ways. If you're looking for an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member (or just something to get yourself) this holiday season, one of these 50-ish-or-under options might be just what you're after.



My favorite sub-$50 deals:

HOTO Wireless Screwdriver: now $54, was $80

Lionwei 10 Port, 10Gbps USB Hub: now $46

Lenovo Go Qi Charging Mouse: now $49, was 59.99



Lionwei Powered 10 Port, 10Gbps USB Hub

(Image credit: Lionwei)

Something I bought last year during Black Friday, this aluminum-shelled USB hub from Lionwei gives me two extra easy-to-reach 10Gbps USB-C ports, a 10 Gbps USB-A port, and four 5Gbps USB-A ports. There are also three USB-A charging ports, rated up to 12W, but I haven't really used them; my phone and earbuds charge wirelessly. Nicely, nine of the ports can be switched off when not in use with the press of a button, with indicator lights (which are tiny and not overly bright) letting you know which ports are enabled.

Lionwei's specs specifically state that the hub doesn't support video output (presumably that means DisplayPort Alt Mode doesn't work over USB-C), but that's never been an issue for me. I primarily use the hub for testing peripherals and using external storage, like the best portable SSDs . In effect, this handy hub has meant that I always have the USB ports I need within easy reach, so I haven't had to crawl under my desk and behind my PC to plug something in for the past year. That's easily worth $46in my book. Maybe yours, too?

Lionwei Powered 10 Port, 10Gbps USB Hub: now $46 at Amazon

This powered 10-port USB hub has three 10Gbps ports (two USB-C, One USB-A), four USB 5Gb ports, and three charging ports.

Lenovo Go Qi Charging Wireless Mouse

(Image credit: Lenovo)

I have wireless charging pads at my desk and three other places around my apartment for keeping my phone and watch juiced up, and I take one with me when I travel. So when I saw Lenovo had a Go Wireless Multi-Device Mouse that charges wirelessly using the Qi standard, I was intrigued. And now that I've owned one for a year, it's my go-to travel rodent. In fact I think I ordered it during last year's Black Friday deals season.



There's not much remarkable about this compact mouse in terms of its design. It houses a USB-C dongle under its magnetic top, and it also works over Bluetooth for pairing it with up to three devices. Lenovo claims 2-3 months of use if you use it a couple of hours a day, which is probably fairly accurate.

I've never been able to tell because whenever I'm done using it, I just drop it on the Qi charging stand on my desk and it's fully charged whenever I pick it up again. Plugging things in is so 2019. However, it does have a USB-C port in the front if you want to pry off the rubber door and charge it the old-school way.



Lenovo Go Wireless Mouse: now $49 at Lenovo (was $59.99)

This unassuming compact mouse hides Qi wireless charging abilities in its base. Just drop it on a charging pad when you're doing and never worry about running out of pointer power again.

Add recessed power and USB ports to your desk for just $16

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.



While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. I have it installed in the narrow stand I built right behind my couch. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Thankfully the coffee table is even more convenient for that and it's right in front of the couch.

Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $29 at Amazon

You'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient.

Powerowl's rechargeable batteries are good and surprisingly cheap

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

When I first started using rechargeable batteries with my Walkman in the early 90s, they were kind of awful (but still better than spending all my money feeding my music addiction). They couldn't hold a charge and didn't last nearly as long as name-brand disposable batteries. But here in the 2020s, rechargeables are surprisingly good.



Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices.

PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $24 at Amazon , was $33

These PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. The included USB-powered charger isn't the fastest (10 hours rated), but it gets the job done.

HyperX Wrist Rest

(Image credit: HyperX)

For anyone who spends their days (and / or nights) in front of a keyboard, a good wrist rest is key for both short-term comfort and long-term limb health. Multiple Tom's Hardware staffers swear by HyperX's gel / memory foam wrist rests.

And with the rise in popularity of compact keyboards, it's nice to see the company now offers a Mini version. At about 9 inches long, it's a good fit for small keyboards, but a 14-inch Tenkeyless option is also available for just a couple dollars more.

HyperX Wrist Rest: now $15 at Amazon (was $19)

Your wrists will thank you for spending $12-$15 on HyperX's gel and foam wrist rest. And with several sizes, you don't need to use one that's bigger than your keyboard anymore.

HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set

(Image credit: Hoto)

I build a lot of PCs and also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a nice thing to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be handier thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling small pieces of furniture.



The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs, but for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. I just wish it came with and stored more than 12 bits. If you don't need this screwdriver right away for a gift, maybe hold off a bit, as it often goes on sale for less than $50. It was $35 during Black Friday.

HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $54 at Amazon (was $79.99)

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I just wish it came with more bits. Don't forget to clip the coupon for an extra 10% off.

Cooler Master ARGB GPU Support Bracket

(Image credit: Cooler Master)

There are lots of ways of dealing with a sagging GPU. You could just ignore it (so long as you aren't transporting your PC somewhere), get a sub-$10 adjustable piston-type GPU brace , or hold your heavy graphics card up in style with Cooler Master's tempered glass and RGB universal GPU Bracket .



With a magnetic base and clip-on metal support shelf, this graphics card holder was simple to install. It's currently holding up the ancient GTX 1080 Ti in our external storage testbed, and by far the most difficult installation step was plugging in the three-prong RGB header onto the motherboard while the system was standing on my workbench.

Is this a lot of features to throw into what's basically a support brace? Sure. But if you spent hundreds making your system look great, $29 is a small price to pay for some pretty GPU support.

Cooler Master ARGB GPU Support Bracket: now $31 at Amazon (was $33.99)

No one asked for a GPU support made of tempered glass and RGB, but Cooler Master delivered, and honestly I don't hate it for less than $30.

TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter

(Image credit: TP-Link)

Have you upgraded your router to Wi-Fi 6, but your desktop or laptop doesn't have the requisite hardware to take advantage of your newer network tech? TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router

I have running downstairs from my office. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case .

TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $39 at Amazon (was $49)

Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter cand deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router.

APC Desk Mount Power Station PE6U4

(Image credit: APC)

If you're a tech person, you always want more power sockets and USB ports within easy reach. And that's exactly what APC's Desk Mount Power Station provides. Designed to be clamped on the edge of a desk or on top of a cubicle wall, it puts six power sockets and four USB charging ports right on your desk. No more bending over or reaching around things to get the sweet, sweet power your device needs.



Oh, and it's also a 1,080-Joule-rated surge protector, so your devices get some added protection as well. I wouldn't trust all my expensive devices to such a small surge protector but hey, it's better than nothing.

APC Desk Mount Power Station PE6U4: now $35 at Amazon (was $42)

This uniquely shaped surge protector is designed to clip on your desk or cubicle wall while giving you six power outlets and four USB power ports.

Anker Power Strip Surge Protector (2100J)

(Image credit: Anker)

What's exciting to say about a surge protector? If it's old and defective, it could help burn your house down. And even if it isn't, it's recommended you replace them every 5 or so years because the parts that actually do the protecting can become less effective over the years. So there's a good chance you're due for a new one. I own three of these Anker Power Strip Surge Protectors (2100J) and they all have worked flawlessly.

Aside from the usual things like 10 three-prong outlets and a handy switch, Anker also includes USB-A and USB-C power outlets, each rated to 12W. I wish these came with more than an 18-month warranty, but I've always had good luck with Anker's customer service, which makes me feel a bit better on that front.

Anker Power Strip Surge Protector (2100J): now $22.99 at Amazon (was $35.99)

With 10 outlets and a switch, this is mostly a pretty standard surge protector. But Anker tosses in a couple of 12W USB power ports as well.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub

(Image credit: Orico)

Much like the APC power station above, this is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device is more about data than power though, delivering USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices.

It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $20.99 at Amazon

An otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design.

8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller

(Image credit: 8Bitdo)

What's not to love about a SNES-inspired wireless gaming controller that's compatible with Windows, Mac, Android and the Nintendo Switch? Not much, but I own the original Pro model and not one of these newer models with translucent plastic shells. That's peak late-90s nostalgia and I really don't want to love it as much as I do.



As you might expect given this controller's small size and many more buttons than the SNES controller it was based on, its Rumble motors aren't the strongest, and the layout can feel kind of cramped for some modern games. But for any kind of retro game and especially platformers (I'm looking at you, Super Mario Bros. Wonder), this is my go-to controller. At this price, maybe I should pick up another one.



8Bitdo SN30 Pro Wireless Bluetooth Controller: now $39 at Amazon (was $45.99)

With its SNES-inspired design and translucent shell, this controller will appeal to gamers of a certain age. But its appeal goes beyond its looks. Click the coupon button to get it at this price.

Hamurubi Large Felt Desk Pad

(Image credit: Hamurubi)

Few things can freshen up your desk space with less effort and cost than a good desk pad. It also helps that putting down a new desk pad means you actually have to clean up your desk. The one I'm using at my main home desk is getting a little funky, so I ordered this felt model from Hamurubi during Black Friday.



It comes in two rather large sizes, and I chose the larger 35.5-inch model to cover most of my work area. I particularly like that it's felt rather than leather, and that it has thousands of anti-slip silicone dots on the bottom to keep it in place. At $10-$12 and available in three shades of gray, if you like the look and feel of felt, it should be a comfy and attractive addition to your desk. I could live without the wolf patch in the right corner, but otherwise, this is a great addition to my desk.

Hamurubi Large Felt Desk Pad: now $12.95 at Amazon (was $14.95)

This felt desk pad is cheap, comes in three shades, and has non-slip dots on the back to keep it in place on your desk.

Clean up the cables under your desk with a tray

(Image credit: Delamu)

Sometimes, the best gifts are passive-aggressive. If all you want for the holidays is for someone in your home or office to get their cables off the floor, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.



Besides the trays, this key also comes with some cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. One of these has been holding up the PC cable clutter in my living room since May. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the external power brick from my TV/Monitor.",technology
"Tesla says it has started production of its Dojo supercomputer to train its fleet of autonomous vehicles.

In its second quarter earnings report for 2023, the company outlined “four main technology pillars” needed to “solve vehicle autonomy at scale: extremely large real-world dataset, neural net training, vehicle hardware and vehicle software.”

“We are developing each of these pillars in-house,” the company said in its report. “This month, we are taking a step towards faster and cheaper neural net training with the start of production of our Dojo training computer.”

Image: Tesla

The automaker already has a large Nvidia GPU-based supercomputer that is one of the most powerful in the world, but the new Dojo custom-built computer is using chips designed by Tesla. In 2019, Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave this “super powerful training computer” a name: Dojo.

Previously, Musk has claimed that Dojo will be capable of an exaflop, or 1 quintillion (​​1018) floating-point operations per second. That is an incredible amount of power. “To match what a one exaFLOP computer system can do in just one second, you’d have to perform one calculation every second for 31,688,765,000 years,” Network World wrote.

At Tesla’s AI Day in 2021, Dojo was still a work in progress. Executives revealed its first chip and training tiles, which would eventually develop into a full Dojo cluster or “exapod.” Tesla said it will combine 2 x 3 tiles in a tray and two trays in a computer cabinet for over 100 petaflops per cabinet. In a 10-cabinet system, Tesla’s Dojo exapod will break the barrier of the exaflop of compute.",technology
"More details are emerging about a data breach the genetic testing company 23andMe first reported in October. But as the company shares more information, the situation is becoming even murkier and creating greater uncertainty for users attempting to understand the fallout.

23andMe said at the beginning of October that attackers had infiltrated some of its users' accounts and piggybacked off of this access to scrape personal data from a larger subset of users through the company's opt-in, social sharing service known as DNA Relatives. At the time, the company didn't indicate how many users had been impacted, but hackers had already begun selling data on criminal forums that seemed to be taken from at least a million 23andMe users, if not more. In a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Friday, the company said that “the threat actor was able to access a very small percentage (0.1 %) of user accounts,” or roughly 14,000 given the company's recent estimate that it has more than 14 million customers.

Fourteen thousand is a lot of people in itself, but the number didn't account for the users impacted by the attacker's data-scraping from DNA Relatives. The SEC filing simply noted that the incident also involved “a significant number of files containing profile information about other users’ ancestry.”

On Monday, 23andMe confirmed to TechCrunch that the attackers collected the personal data of about 5.5 million people who had opted in to DNA Relatives, as well as information from an additional 1.4 million DNA Relatives users who “had their Family Tree profile information accessed."" 23andMe subsequently shared this expanded information with WIRED as well.

OpenAI’s Custom Chatbots Are Leaking Their Secrets Released earlier this month, OpenAI’s GPTs let anyone create custom chatbots. But some of the data they’re built on is easily exposed.

From the group of 5.5 million people, hackers stole display names, most recent login, relationship labels, predicted relationships, and percentage of DNA shared with DNA Relatives matches. In some cases, this group also had other data compromised, including ancestry reports and details about where on their chromosomes they and their relatives had matching DNA, self-reported locations, ancestor birth locations, family names, profile pictures, birth years, links to self-created family trees, and other profile information. The smaller (but still massive) subset of 1.4 million impacted DNA Relatives users all had data compromised from the aforementioned specific profile known as “Family Tree.” The stolen data included display names and relationship labels and, in some cases, birth years and self-reported location data.

Asked why this expanded information wasn't in the SEC filing, 23andMe spokesperson Katie Watson tells WIRED that “we are only elaborating on the information included in the SEC filing by providing more specific numbers.”

23andMe has maintained that attackers used a technique known as credential stuffing to compromise the 14,000 user accounts—finding instances where leaked login credentials from other services were reused on 23andMe. In the wake of the incident, the company forced all of its users to reset their passwords and began requiring two-factor authentication for all customers. In the weeks after 23andMe initially disclosed its breach, other similar services. including Ancestry and MyHeritage, also began promoting or requiring two-factor authentication on their accounts.",technology
"It’s 2061. Earth’s surface is frozen solid. To escape an expanding Sun, the planet has embarked on a space voyage. Thousands of fusion engines propel it across our solar system. The further from the Sun it travels, the colder it gets. Half the population is dead, and survivors live in vast underground cities. But Earth must reach Alpha Centauri, where there is a perfectly good, nonexpanding Sun to allow us to get back to normal. “A journey of 4.5 light years begins with a single step,” as Confucius never said.

That’s the plot of the thoroughly bonkers and entirely enjoyable 2019 Chinese sci-fi movie The Wandering Earth. On release, it broke domestic box office records, and globally it has become the fifth-highest-grossing non-English-language film of all time. It is interesting on a number of levels, not least for what it says about soft power and how China projects its view of space.

The film’s director, Frant Gwo, says American sci-fi writers portray space as “the endless frontier”—a new horizon for humans to colonize. The Chinese narrative, he argues, is to improve life on Earth by using space as a resource. “When the Earth experiences this kind of crisis in Hollywood films, the hero always ventures out into space to find a new home, which is a very American approach—adventure, individualism,” Gwo told The Hollywood Reporter. “But in my film, we work as a team to take the whole Earth with us. This comes from Chinese cultural values—homeland, history, and continuity.”

This is an extract from Tim Marshall’s The Future of Geography: How Power and Politics In Space Will Change Our World. Published April 27 by Elliott & Thompson.

It’s no surprise that The Wandering Earth has been enthusiastically embraced by the Chinese Communist Party—it was partially produced by the state-owned China Film Group Corporation, and the Ministry of Education recommended that it be aired in schools across the country. It also aired globally on Netflix, and the Foreign Ministry in Beijing did its bit for publicity, with spokesperson Hua Chunying telling journalists unprompted: “I know the hottest movie now is The Wandering Earth. I don’t know if you have watched or not. I’d recommend it.”

The Wandering Earth chimes nicely with Xi Jingping’s political agenda. Beijing knows that the US and other countries view its growing space capabilities as a threat. The movie allows it to suggest to foreign audiences that there is nothing to fear from its activities while simultaneously boosting domestic national pride and interest.

The Chinese president has long pushed the idea that China’s space program—which is entirely and directly controlled by the People’s Liberation Army—is no threat to anyone, that it seeks to work within international frameworks and for the good of humankind. But is that really true? And how will China’s stellar ambitions shape the future of global politics?",technology

orientation, and energetic emphasis.

These types of tools, it's just a short list

and a much longer list of ways

that you can modify dance motions.

Choreographers have a very long practice in history

of modifying dance motions in these ways,

and you could see how I could immediately take one motion

and turn it into this long extended, creative,

compelling, and original dance.

But one very critical thing to note

is that these tools are not specific to a human body.

They could be done on any moving body, including a robot.

Shared tools between roboticists and choreographers

are just one thing that these two domains have in common.

And choreo-robotics is the emerging field

that captures all of these intersections

between dance and robotics.

I'm a robot choreographer.

At Stanford, I use artificial intelligence

to teach robots how to do all kinds of new tasks.

Like open doors, much harder than you think it is,

respond to gestures, play music, and dance.

During my PhD, I spent three years

as the inaugural artist in residence

at Everyday Robots at Google X.

I've spent the last several years traveling the world,

dancing with robots,

and choreographing over a dozen different kinds of robots

for art installations and performances.

So people often ask me like, Why I dance with robots?

And as my former colleague and friend, Benjie Holson put it,

Well, the main difference between a robot and a computer

is that a robot moves.

How a robot moves is a vital part of the way

that a robot is perceived?

And choreographers are experts

at making meaning out of movement.

In fact, art and culture is one of the most important ways

that we incorporate new technologies

into our society and our public discourse.

One fundamental part of our species

is our relationships with our tools that we build.

And so if we aren't incorporating them

in art and culture,

then we will have missed this opportunity

to kind of codify them into the public dialogue.

Dance for me is that art and culture.

So we used to dance around fires, we dance for the rain,

we dance at proms and weddings, we dance on TikTok,

and now we dance with robots.

Robots are increasingly becoming part of our everyday lives,

and as this transition continues,

they're going to be recognized for more than just

the utilitarian value that they provide.

They're going to be recognized for

how they show up in the world, how they move.

Movement elicits emotions.

If we aren't intelligent about the way that a robot moves

relative to people in our everyday lives,

we will have missed this incredibly important opportunity

for robots to not only be safe,

but for them to create harmonious, dynamic interactions

with other humans as a part of our daily lives.

We've seen a very similar process before.

When computers moved from military and research applications

into personal computing,

all of these other domains became super relevant,

like psychology, semiotics, animation, sound design.

We observed that process in personal computing,

and we're experiencing something very similar in robotics.

As we move from research labs and factories

into office buildings and sidewalks,

we need domains like dance to help us create these

legible, compatible and safe relationships

between humans and robots.

So towards this end, all of my art,

research, and business endeavors ask this question,

what kinds of novel experiences can we create

that leverage a robot's features as both

a utilitarian tool and an evocative, moving, social agent?

When I was an artist in residence at Everyday Robots,

there were dozens of these kinds of robots running around.

They were wiping tables and sorting trash

and doing all kinds of useful things.

Well, I'm an artist in residence,

so I have these ideas about how can we imbue these robots

with more personality

and give a sense of wonder and delight

in sides of these offices.

So my first idea was that we would have the robots

play these bespoke, sculptural musical instruments.

So the robots are going down the hall, they wipe the table,

they play a little cello, and then they keep going.

And that was my first idea.

So I was brainstorming on this with my friend Tom Emberson,

who's a software engineer at Everyday Robots.

And Tom had this incredible provocation.

He said, What if the robot was the instrument?

So after a few months working with Tom

and a couple of software engineers, Adrian Lee,

Daniel Lamb, Emery Fisher, Kyle Jeffrey,

and our marvelous composer, Peter Van Stratton,

we turned Tom's provocation

into a new software called Music Mode.

In Music Mode, we take every single one of the joint,

the robot's, joint velocities,

and we map them to different sounds

so that the robot makes music while it moves.

This is so different

from how many choreographers are used to working

where you pick a piece of music

and you choreograph something to it.

In this case, we literally took those encoder values

and we translated them into sound, we sonified them.

So you have this robot that's wiggling around

and it's creating music.

This was very artistically challenging

because we needed to have all of these different joints

be able to play in combination with each other

and sound great in any permutation at any time.

And we also wanted the joint itself

to sort of match up with that kind of music.

So if you had a big heavy torso joint,

you wanted a low sound

or a tiny, tiny gripper joint, you needed a high bell sound.

So we decided to go with analog instruments

because we thought it add this warmth and depth

and richness to the robots

that we weren't getting otherwise.

And here's what it looks like just on the robot's elbow,

so you can hear the woodwinds and listen for it.

[gentle music]

Here's what it looked like to have many joints

moving in combination with each other.

For all the musicians out there,

you'll see that the head is going

with these kind of pulsating brass sounds.

We've got the bell of the gripper, the strings on the base.

And here's what it sounds like.

[soft music]

[soft music continues]

This feature became so popular

that we put it on all 180 robots,

and we allowed the software to be turned on at any time

because it didn't interfere with the robot's motions.

So the robots could be doing anything,

and you would hear the music like wipe a table

and you hear the symphony.

[soft music]

[audience clapping]

I got a number of cold emails from different engineers

who were sort of breaking into tears

in the middle of the day

because they were feeling themselves having this moment

of human connection with a robot.

And again, it was this sort of symbiotic nature

between art and human robot interaction and technology

where it just elevated this task

from a table wiping task

into this beautiful part of everyday life.

And made me think a lot about,

wow, we could live that way if we wanted to.

So now that we had music

that you could dynamically generate with movement,

I wanted to create this project that would get the robots

to improvisationally move around

so we could have many robots

who were all playing this at once.

And this is now called Project Starling.

So Project Starling started from this question,

what would it be like for humans and robots to move together

as if they were in a canonical,

sort of beautiful flock together,

as if it was as natural

as all of us moving through this building?

And we started with this algorithm called Boids Algorithm,

it's a very well-known flocking algorithm

and then we added a ton of stuff on top of it.

So one of the features that we added

was this circling feature.

We could get the robot to sort of swirl in these whirlpools

around the middle of the atrium.

We also started working on a following feature.

So you can imagine kind of being a camp counselor

and having your kids follow you around.

That's a little bit what this felt like.

So this was our following feature that we incorporated.

We added these parallel lines so you could have this sort of

very beautiful wave-like action

that you were experiencing with the robots

as they were going by.

And then I trained a machine learning model

to select between the gains

for all of these different features,

much like I myself, a choreographer would.

What does that mean?

It means that every single time these robots would flock,

the experience was completely different.

It was improvisational, it was surprising,

it was organic, it felt different, it was compelling.

So every single time that this experience happened,

it was never the same.

And this is exactly what we were trying to capture

about this sort of symbiotic nature of art and technology.

We then added some gesture recognition on top of it

so I could put my hands together

and the robots would all look it up at the sky.

I put my left hand in the air, they would all turn,

put my right hand in the air,

they'd all open and close their grippers.

So again, we kind of, little by little,

we were layering on this artistry

and it allowed you to have a new novel experience

every single time.

So this is what everything looks like all together.

The music is music mode.

The flocking behavior, of course, is from Project Starling.

[gentle music]

[audience clapping]

Kids love this, by the way,

and they're a very tough audience.

So I thought that was a great endorsement.

And we actually ran a research experiment,

both with music mode and with Project Starling.

And we found that robots that were running music mode

while they were doing a variety of different kinds of tasks

were considered more anthropomorphic,

animate, likable, safe, and intelligent.

This was what we learned from music mode.

And so then we ran a study with this flocking behavior

with Project Starling,

and we asked people what they experienced

as they did this experiment.

And these are some of the responses that we got.

I feel like I'm in heaven.

Am I ascending?

They were so cute out there singing and dancing.

I have no idea what they were actually supposed to be doing,

but it made me very happy.

And This feels poetic.

I'm having a visceral emotional reaction.

We are all spending quite a bit of time these days

talking about artificial intelligence and robotics.

I invite you to consider all the ways

in which you can use artificial intelligence and robotics

to unlock deep, human feeling

to create businesses, research and art

that are profound, joyful, and meaningful.

Maybe even something that feels like you're ascending.

My work is about making robots more friendly,

interactive, easy to teach, and easy to navigate around

and to take robots a step further,

to elevate them from a tool

to a whimsical part of everyday life.

And again, I get asked all the time, why should we do this?

I've got a lot of great answers about robot safety,

robot legibility, human robot collaborative effectiveness.

Yet my tendency is to ask why not?

What kind of world do we wanna live in?

One where our experiences with robots and other technologies

make us feel fear, boredom, confusion, less human?

Or one where our proximity to and collaborations with robots

give us a sense of curiosity, joy, and deep humanness?

Let's keep exploring,

building businesses, research and art

that creates the world we want to live in.

"Two decades after its birth, the World Wide Web is in decline, as simpler, sleeker services—think apps—are less about the searching and more about the getting. Chris Anderson explains how this new paradigm reflects the inevitable course of capitalism. And Michael Wolff explains why the new breed of media titan is forsaking the Web for more promising (and profitable) pastures.

Who’s to Blame: Us

As much as we love the open, unfettered Web, we’re abandoning it for simpler, sleeker services that just work.

By Chris Anderson

You wake up and check your email on your bedside iPad—that’s one app. During breakfast you browse Facebook, Twitter, and The New York Times—three more apps. On the way to the office, you listen to a podcast on your smartphone. Another app. At work, you scroll through RSS feeds in a reader and have Skype and IM conversations. More apps. At the end of the day, you come home, make dinner while listening to Pandora, play some games on Xbox Live, and watch a movie on Netflix’s streaming service.

You’ve spent the day on the Internet—but not on the Web. And you are not alone.

This is not a trivial distinction. Over the past few years, one of the most important shifts in the digital world has been the move from the wide-open Web to semiclosed platforms that use the Internet for transport but not the browser for display. It’s driven primarily by the rise of the iPhone model of mobile computing, and it’s a world Google can’t crawl, one where HTML doesn’t rule. And it’s the world that consumers are increasingly choosing, not because they’re rejecting the idea of the Web but because these dedicated platforms often just work better or fit better into their lives (the screen comes to them, they don’t have to go to the screen). The fact that it’s easier for companies to make money on these platforms only cements the trend. Producers and consumers agree: The Web is not the culmination of the digital revolution.

A decade ago, the ascent of the Web browser as the center of the computing world appeared inevitable. It seemed just a matter of time before the Web replaced PC application software and reduced operating systems to a “poorly debugged set of device drivers,” as Netscape cofounder Marc Andreessen famously said. First Java, then Flash, then Ajax, then HTML5—increasingly interactive online code—promised to put all apps in the cloud and replace the desktop with the webtop. Open, free, and out of control.

But there has always been an alternative path, one that saw the Web as a worthy tool but not the whole toolkit. In 1997, Wired published a now-infamous “Push!” cover story, which suggested that it was time to “kiss your browser goodbye.” The argument then was that “push” technologies such as PointCast and Microsoft’s Active Desktop would create a “radical future of media beyond the Web.”

“Sure, we’ll always have Web pages. We still have postcards and telegrams, don’t we? But the center of interactive media—increasingly, the center of gravity of all media—is moving to a post-HTML environment,” we promised nearly a decade and half ago. The examples of the time were a bit silly—a “3-D furry-muckers VR space” and “headlines sent to a pager”—but the point was altogether prescient: a glimpse of the machine-to-machine future that would be less about browsing and more about getting.

Who’s to Blame: Them

Chaos isn’t a business model. A new breed of media moguls is bringing order—and profits—to the digital world.

By Michael Wolff

An amusing development in the past year or so—if you regard post-Soviet finance as amusing—is that Russian investor Yuri Milner has, bit by bit, amassed one of the most valuable stakes on the Internet: He’s got 10 percent of Facebook. He’s done this by undercutting traditional American VCs—the Kleiners and the Sequoias who would, in days past, insist on a special status in return for their early investment. Milner not only offers better terms than VC firms, he sees the world differently. The traditional VC has a portfolio of Web sites, expecting a few of them to be successes—a good metaphor for the Web itself, broad not deep, dependent on the connections between sites rather than any one, autonomous property. In an entirely different strategic model, the Russian is concentrating his bet on a unique power bloc. Not only is Facebook more than just another Web site, Milner says, but with 500 million users it’s “the largest Web site there has ever been, so large that it is not a Web site at all.”",technology

I brought a notebook up partially

'cause I'm an old reporter and I'm only comfortable

when I have a notebook in my hand.

But also because I want to go through

a little bit of a list for the person

we're about to talk to.

'Cause the movies that Rodrigo Prieto

has been the cinematographer director of photography on

are titles like Brokeback Mountain, Babel,

Argo, which was originally a Wired story

before it was a movie, just saying.

Wolf of Wall Street, three Taylor Swift videos,

and then this year,

one of the most important examinations

of kind of prejudice and culture and American history,

and then also Killers of the Flower Moon,

'cause the other one was Barbie.

[audience laughs]

These are true facts.

And those last two movies, Flower Moon, and Barbie

have made some people suggest,

and I'm gonna make fun of him about this a little bit,

that Rodrigo may be competing against himself

in the cinematography category at the Oscars.

So we'll just be fan-ish about that

for the next 20 minutes or so

and talk about color and art and maybe a little AI too,

'cause I guess it's today at Wired

and that's what people are talking about.

So join me, if you will,

in welcoming Rodrigo Prieto to the stage.

[audience applauds]

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Adam.

Thanks hi, thanks for coming up.

So I listed some of the movies,

but I want to list some of the names of directors

that you have worked with because

there's a question I wanna ask about this.

So, Spike Lee, Ang Lee, Alejandro Inarritu,

Ben Affleck, Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig.

I wonder if you can think about what it is like working

with these folks and how that might have changed.

Because I look at that list and think

it's four, maybe five generations of directors

of big, important movies,

and people who, at the more recent end,

grew up studying some of the early films

of the people at the older end.

So have you seen how your interactions with them

have changed, are there trends in the ways

that directors want to talk to you

about what the movies look like?

Well, I guess I started at 11 or something. [laughs]

I actually did with Stop Motions Parade and stuff, but,

not really.

I mean, I think that,

of course every director is a different universe,

just as any person is a different universe

and you have a different perspective

and a different view on things,

and also, a different approach creatively.

And as a cinematographer,

I try to get into that universe myself

because it's my responsibility

to bring that vision to the screen.

So of course I bring my own ideas and, you know,

my artistry or my craft,

but I really try to understand

the perspective of the director.

And I enjoy that enormously because I feel it makes me grow

as a person and as a cinematographer too, you know,

that instead of, okay, this is my style

and this is the way I shoot, take it or leave it.

You hire me, all right, you get Rodrigo Prieto special.

But no, I think that, in fact,

I just remembered when I shot Eight Mile

or when I was interviewing for Eight Mile,

with Curtis Hansen,

I kept interviewing and he didn't hire me, right?

Well, he did eventually, but he wasn't hiring me.

So finally, in the fourth interview, I asked him,

Okay, Curtis, you know, what's going on?

Do you want me to shoot it?

And he said, Well, this is the thing.

I've seen a lot of your movies in Mexico,

I saw Amores Perros, but I saw some of the other movies,

and they're very different.

There's you know, more stylish and you know, and pretty,

and I don't want that for 'Eight Mile,'

and I'm thinking maybe 'Amores Perros' was a fluke.

Maybe it was a director in [speaks foreign language]

[Host] He was worried

that you were gonna be too much you and not enough him?

No, no, that my style was more naturally pretty

than gritty.

And I said, Of course not.

You know, in the Eight Mile, I'd never, you know,

it requires some harshness.

So anyway, it's something that I adapt, you know,

and directors, I don't know, I think it's really,

for me, the language with a director is emotional.

And so I try to communicate in that way

and then bring techniques to match that.

You were in, the two movies that are out this year

are just visually, tonally, and story-wise,

and visually for sure super different.

And you were working on them,

there's some overlap from when you're working on them.

So what was that like, like are you,

do you just sort of head snap back and forth between,

you know, painterly amber

and wall of pink Mattel bright colors,

or what's the process like?

Well, I've always been very interested in color.

So that's just as an expressive tool.

And so that was an important facet of every movie I do,

but certainly of Barbie and Killers of Flower the Moon,

of both of them, but I was prepping Killers of Flower Moon

in Oklahoma and Bartlesville, Oklahoma,

and the height of COVID

when Greta Gerwig called me about Barbie.

So that was thrilling for me because I loved Greta.

I'd met her before and love what she does,

and her energy is just amazing.

So I was really keen to work with her,

but also to do that, to go from the darkness

of this story of Killers of the Flower Moon

to Barbie and find my own thing there, you know,

as a human also my Ken-ness, if you may.

[audience laughs] You know. [laughs]

Yeah, I'm k-enough. [everyone laughs]

So that was exciting to me.

But indeed it was kind of a head snap.

And we'd do Zooms every weekend with Greta

and with Sarah Greenwood, the production designer.

Finally, I had to tell Greta, Okay, now I'm two weeks

or three weeks from shooting 'Killers of the Flower Moon,'

I think I better concentrate on this, so let's stop this.

And then when I finished in Oklahoma,

immediately, I flew to London to start prepping Barbie.

I wanna deep dive a little bit on the [coughs]

Ken-ematography for a moment, if I may.

Yeah, I stole your joke, can't help it.

I read that when you were working on Barbie,

that one of the things you wanted to do

was try to capture or recapitulate 1950s and sixties,

three color technicolor. Right.

And I think maybe I have the chronology about that wrong,

so I wanna ask about that, first of all,

how that came about, and also,

maybe just have you explain what that is

and why those colors were so vivid in a fifties,

you know, a Douglas circa romance,

a musical that people might remember from the fifties

and what's different about now

and how color is produced in film.

Like what has changed and how do you

recapture the old magic?

Well, in fact, on Killers of Flower Moon,

I did a very deep dive into the way color

is made in photography, because I had this notion

of reproducing the beginning of color photography

in the beginning of the movie.

So I started researching auto chrome, particularly,

because to me it's an import from Europe,

just as descendants of the European settlers

are the ones who are, you know, in Oklahoma

and are, you know, want the oil money.

So I thought that's a good way

of representing that part of the story.

So I really did a lot of research into that,

which included three strip technicolor,

because color and photography is actually

made out of black and white layers, you know.

So the first color photographs were literally

like three photographs in black and white

with a filter in front of the lens,

you know, red, green, blue, and then

you combine those three black and white images,

and through a process of filtration on the printing,

which I don't quite understand, [chuckles] you get color.

So to me it's kind of magical.

But three strip technicolor is similar in the sense that

it was a film camera with three pieces

of black and white film running through the camera,

simultaneously, and with a prism behind the shutter.

It would, you know, spread the light through filters,

through colored filters,

to the different black and white images,

and then that's put together in the printing process,

and that creates color. You know,

like, you can imagine what this looks like,

that's, that really lurid, vivid, like you know,

Singing in the Rain color, that doesn't,

it's not how you do color filmmaking today,

even if you're using film,

much less if you're using digital.

It's a totally different process than used today.

Very different process, but also,

one thing that I felt for Barbie, in general,

just in the design of the look of it,

was the key word for me was innocence.

And the three strip technicolor is kind of innocent

in the sense that the colors are pure.

They're not, you know, the red's red,

it's not sort of so influenced by, you know,

a little bit green and yellow, you know,

that's why it feels so saturated.

There's not all the nuance of actual color

that you see with your eyes.

So that's why it looks kind of artificial.

So Greta had talked about making Barbie Land artificial,

but authentic.

And so that, for me, three strip technicolor made sense.

And I had just used, let's call it a digital filter.

It's a LUT, a lookup table for Killers of the Flower Moon.

I used several, but one of them was three strip technicolor.

Towards the end of the movie,

there's a moment which is in the thirties,

and the movie has a whole idea of representation.

And so towards the end, the scene,

I thought we should give it the color of the thirties,

which would be three strip technicolor.

So I had already created that lookup table for that film.

So I used it as a basis for the lookup table

for Barbie, but it didn't work.

But what I did is I photographed the colors of the sets,

you know, all the different pinks and cyans and yellows

with a stand-in, or different stand-ins,

because there are many different skin tones on Barbie.

And I had to make sure that the faces looked natural,

but to enhance these other colors.

So we tweaked it, we created actually a software called PPL.

It's initials, my name Prieto, Panzini,

one of the designers, and Lucas,

the color timer of the movie.

Anyway, we created this software to manipulate colors,

and in fact, the black and white layers of color,

very specifically.

So we created techno Barbie instead of technicolor.

And you can do that, you're doing software

for color timing, for processing after the movie's shot.

So are you shooting digital and it only works on digital

'cause Flower Moon's on film though, right?

So does it become digital at some moment,

it turns from grains of chemical film into pixels?

That's exactly right.

We actually prepare it in pre-production.

We make these lookup tables in pre-production

so that during the process of filming,

especially in Barbie, which was with digital cameras,

you can actually onset,

look at the monitors with the lookup table.

So we saw what the image looked like through techno Barbie.

So instead of what you're actually seeing on the set,

you can look on a monitor and see

what I'll see when I go see the movie.

[Rodrigo Prieto] Exactly.

And it's different, that's weird.

[laughs] Yeah, it is, it is weird.

But on Killers of Flower Moon, it was mostly film.

We shot maybe 10% on digital.

So you can't see on set this LUT,

but you see it on the dailies.

So the dailies are digital, you know, it's film,

but you scan the film and then it becomes

digital information and editing,

all of it happens digitally.

So even though we capture on motion picture negative,

the rest of the process is digital.

That's such a, I know this is totally normal for you,

but it does seem like, that there's a moment where

the kind of, the visual,

whatever the real thing is that you have shot,

then gets captured by either a chemical processor

or a digital one, you know, the same,

roughly similar technology

to like what's in everybody's phone.

Like there's a change for what you're actually seeing.

Are you trying to, is the director trying to,

in talking to you about making it look like

what they saw on set or on location that day?

Or does it turn into, does it become the arched?

Are you trying to make it look like something else,

you know, the product,

once it gets past your eyeballs or past the monitor?

Well, it depends.

Usually I try to make it look something else,

if that's the design, if that's what we're going for.

And in the case of Barbie, for sure,

we were going for this techno Barbie look.

But on Killers of the Flower Moon,

the sequences that had to do only with the Osage people

and their rituals where Europeans or European settlers,

White people weren't involved,

then we try to use the color as naturalistic as possible.

So we shot 'em, film negative,

and then, you know, you transfer it to digital.

But trying to, that the colors are reproduced

as faithfully as our eyes see it,

because even our eyes are interpreting color in our brains,

and you know, we have our own little, you know,

cameras in our eyes and our brains.

So color is an abstraction, as you know, you know,

it's a reflection of light off of objects.

So, well, as you know, in fact,

red apple is everything except red.

It's reflecting red light, it's absorbing every other.

So anyway, everything's a lookup table in the end.

So the reason I ask this,

other than I love the technology of it,

is I wonder, you know, you're doing this for an artistic,

for an emotional impact to be thematically part of the film,

or to have an emotional impact on an audience,

do you, this is gonna sound like an insult when I say it,

do you think that people get it?

Like when you were saying, you know,

trying to build the artificial,

but authentic world of Barbie,

or the naturalistic world of Osage people without,

you know, European eyeballs on it,

that's because that's intrinsic to that story.

Does a person going to see that film know that's going on?

If they've never heard that,

they don't know that's happening,

do they feel it in some other way?

What effect are you hoping to draw

to make happen in my head when I see that,

without knowing what you just told me?

Well, to me it's like music.

I don't know if a C minor next to a F,

or whatever it is, [chuckles] what that is,

but I know that when I listen to a melody,

it makes me feel something.

So lighting is, and you know,

after all, most of what I do is lighting and color,

texture, composition,

all these are things that aren't words, right?

So it affects you in a way that I can't describe exactly,

but it certainly does.

There's no doubt that this vibration coming off the screen

affects you in one way or the other.

So it doesn't matter if anybody knows if it's techno Barbie

or you know, any of that, or auto chrome,

or you know, just, you just have a feeling

on Killers of the Flower Moon of this sort of old image,

and then you feel these natural images,

and then after a certain point in the movie,

I shifted when this house explodes

and all hell breaks loose,

I shifted the look to a much harsher, contrasty

sort of de-saturated look that emulates A and R,

which is a whole nother thing.

So, and nobody knows, nobody cares.

But what does matter to me is what you feel, you know,

'cause for sure there's a, you know,

there is a feeling to it

and hopefully it helps communicate an emotion.

Just like the soundtrack in the film,

you don't know, oh, right now these notes of this music

are making me feel this way.

I try to make cinematography invisible

and the design invisible,

but hopefully you feel it in the heart and soul.

And part of the reason that I ask is that

all of these things are, to some extent about, you know,

authorial intent, the creator's intent,

and how that then translates to

somebody watching, to an audience,

but now that there are increasingly available tools that,

because machine learning, artificial intelligence,

because there are software tools that are generative,

that can create images,

presumably with themes that either come from a prompt

or come from all of the data that they're trained on,

but have no intent

'cause the machines don't intend anything,

but can still, well I mean this to be a question,

can they still induce those kind of emotional responses?

Would you use them?

Do you think they work on their own terms,

and then would you ever consider

using them as tools yourself?

Right, I'm really not scared of technology.

Only one thing I am scared of, it's acronyms.

I never know, you know, PXTD,

but anyway, that sort of stuff.

But it's tools, you know, and indeed,

I think that the design of an artist

is essential and an artist, right, a human,

because I was thinking of, say for example,

stop motion, Pinocchio, for example.

It could have been done with a computer for sure.

That could be CG for sure, or even AI, you know,

but there is something about just kind of knowing

that this is, a human was painstakingly moving these,

which is amazing and magical.

And Barbie for example, you know,

there were many scenes that we did,

you know, really like the theater, you know,

where the sets are completely physical and you know,

you have a person moving the little dolphins like that,

and you know, people are just pulling pulleys.

But also, there are other scenes where we use LED monitors

to light the moment and make it look as if

they're in Barbie Land, you know-

[Host] The volume, the Mandalorian thing

where you have the whole screen around them

so that they're lit by whatever the effect

is gonna be put in later.

Exactly, like the 2001 sequence,

that's what we use for that.

Or, you know, or when she's driving around,

that was all in the volume.

You know, so we use both and I think either is valid.

Yeah, no, no, but I'm gonna stick to this.

Sure, those are tools that you or Greta or Martin,

first name basis obviously with all these folks,

choose to use to convey what's going on in their head,

the emotional significance,

but now there's a real possibility

that the tool can just do it without your intervention,

without any of these directors intervention.

Do I get the same effect?

I see it, I don't know if you did it

or Ken GPT did it. Right, yeah.

Is it the same?

I think that the, say AI, will be able to do, you know,

so many things and use algorithms to figure out

what will elicit a stronger emotion

and the exciting stuff and all that for sure,

but I think that there is no substitute

for the exploration by a human being of the human soul.

And I don't think, that's something that we need,

I mean, that part of storytelling, I think,

is essential as humans.

And I don't think any machine is ever gonna replace it,

although the tools will, you know,

will be used more and more, just as you were saying.

And even I've used a little bit of that,

you know, certainly in Prevas and things of that sort,

you know, it's helpful,

and just talking about de-aging for example,

you know, it's a combination,

and some characters in the movie I directed

where it's an artist creates the look,

but then the AI will figure out how that would behave

in this movement of the actor, you know, things like that.

And I think that's a great tool, you know.

So I want you to talk about this a little bit more

in the time we have left.

You have your own movie that you're directing,

that you're in post on now?

So talk about more about that

because you're using some of the tools,

as well as, I have to imagine, all of the other skills

that you have acquired over this long career.

Yeah, a little bit of everything, yes.

It's a Mexican movie called Pedro Paramo.

It's an adaptation of a famous Mexican novel.

I highly recommend it, Pedro Paramo.

And so the story takes place in different decades

and also even like different sort of ghostly,

and it's bizarre, it's surreal.

But some of the characters have to be,

you know, from the age of 20 or 1920 to,

there's sixties, seventies.

So, and most of the actors,

I try to hire kind of somewhere in the middle,

you know, and so when they're older, it's prosthetics,

but when they're younger we have to de-age.

So we are using,

and it's something that I'm in the middle of, you know,

still looking at the first test, the first results of it.

And it's promising, a little scary,

because again, it's not, you know,

it is a face of the actor

and it is their performance,

but the computer has to figure out, you know,

how, with the movement of the face and all that,

how the ears would look, you know, all these things.

So it's kind of guessing from my perspective,

but also the computer is guessing, you know,

but it's, I don't know, I find it exciting and interesting

to, you know, apply all these tools.

[Host] Does it look the way you want it to look?

[Rodrigo Prieto] I've only seen one shot [laughs]

and that one looks good, yes.

[laughs] Well, it must be so different though.

We just spent this time talking about how

you've worked so diligently to transmit

the visual intelligence and emotional intelligence

of other directors, so how has it been for you when like,

there was nobody, like they were all looking at you?

[laughs] Yes, it is true, it's happened to me.

'Cause I've also half shot it with another DP,

I collaborated with another DP to shoot it.

But it is the kind of thing where you finish a shot

and you know, and cut,

and then you look to see what the director thinks, right?

Oh no, oh, I have to decide if this works or not.

But I expected it to be more challenging,

I mean, certainly very challenging, especially, you know,

the production, the time, all these things.

But I've always been very interested

in actors and in acting,

and so I found it easier than I expected

to know what I liked or not from a performance,

and being able to guide an actor.

And of course I've seen, you know,

all the directors I've worked with talk with actors

and what, you know, what causes certain reactions,

and of course every actor is also different,

but yeah, I was able to navigate it sort of well, I think.

Can you think of specific examples from

what you would pull from a given director you've worked with

and how you went to an actor?

Like who did what that you thought,

Oh, I'm totally gonna use that to get somebody to cry.

[laughs] Yeah, cry!

Okay, now cry, now! Shouting at them

next to the kid, does that work?

I always assumed it would. It's like Yoda, come on!

No, it's funny, I just showed a cut of my film to Scorsese

[laughs] and- Can you imagine

showing a movie that you just, I just made a movie,

here it is, Martin Scorsese, would you mind taking a look?

Yeah exactly, it was pretty intimidating, but,

and also it's in Spanish and all that with subtitles,

but he got it, he understood everything.

That was a very good step.

'Cause it's a complicated movie.

But anyway, at the end,

I forgot to mention it in the beginning,

but at the end I went, I hope you don't mind

all the shots that are homages,

oh, I don't dunno how you pronounce it, homages?

Yeah, yeah. Homages to you.

And he goes, Like what?

[Host] So, oh no! [laughs]

Oh, okay, so now I have to say which shots, right?

[Host] Oh no.

Is it worse if he notices or doesn't?

I don't know which is the, it's like,

No, that was, I was, that was, you were,

you didn't, you know, well I'll go back to the, exactly.

No one thing from Scorsese is that

besides his cinematic language, which I love,

I mean the way he uses a camera,

also the way he works with actors is very close

in the sense that he's not the director

that'll tell an actor, do this, do that,

he'll listen and he'll adapt to what the actors are feeling,

what they want to do, what they want to try.

Anything an actor wants to try,

you can bet we're gonna do it.

And I think that's brought some very interesting

results to all his movies, you know,

improvisations or things like that.

So I really try to incorporate that

and yeah, work very, very closely with actors,

and just as I do with directors,

I think the key word for me is listen.

And so I try to listen to the actors.

Is there a palette that you were working with,

a color spectrum for emotion and theme in this,

the way that you would on another movie?

What should I be looking for when I see it?

On Pedro Paramo?

Strangely, it's a little more simple,

maybe than another movies,

maybe because I had to concentrate on directing.

But there are two looks, because there are two eras,

one is this character Juan Preciado,

who goes to the town where he was born, his mother's dying,

he says, Go back there and go find your father,

who he hasn't met, really, and get what's yours.

That's the premise.

So he goes there and he finds this ghost town basically,

and his father's dead.

And it turns out everybody's dead, including him.

Ooh, spoiler. [laughs]

So that's one story. Damn it, man.

No, no, it's good, it's all good, it's all good.

And then, you'll still enjoy it.

Then there's a, [laughs]

there's a story of his father, of Pedro Paramo.

So what I did is this story of the man

who goes to look for his father is kind of a devoid of color

because it's a ghost town, basically, or some colors.

And Pedro Paramo's story is very naturalistic,

like the Osage. [chuckles]

All right, Rodrigo, thank you for doing this.

I really appreciate it, and thank you for your movies too.

[Rodrigo Prieto] My pleasure.

Thank you all. [audience applauds]",technology
"“I’m fundamentally changed as a human having gone through something like that,” she said in an interview.

The episode also detonated a debate in Virginia and beyond about digital and sexual privacy in 21st-century politics. In a possible reflection of shifting social norms, Gibson nearly won the race anyway — she lost by less than 1,000 votes and has not ruled out a return to electoral politics in the future. (Despite losing Gibson’s race, Democrats still took full control of the Virginia State Legislature.)

To explore the difficult social and legal questions that churned through Virginia politics, POLITICO Magazine spoke with Gibson about her experience in the campaign — and the implications of that race for a larger cohort of younger candidates who grew up in a world of increasingly blurry lines around their public, private and online lives.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

The last three months of a campaign are just a blur. Can you talk about what that experience was like for you, having to do the home sprint of a campaign with this other issue on top of it?

My entire life was rocked on Sept. 11, when the article ran. It ran, implying that I performed sex acts online with my husband for money. It was really written based on this Dropbox file that self-described Republican operatives shopped around. They had found these videos on the dark web and shopped them around to various news outlets. I didn’t have any idea that there were ever videos of me that had been made and uploaded to multiple sites.

I think it was Sept. 7, I was in clinic seeing patients and a reporter reached out to my campaign, trying to get my phone number. That’s how I found out. When you find out that there are sexually explicit videos of you online, especially by being contacted by national reporters — it is a feeling that I would not wish on my worst enemy.

It took me about two weeks to actually be able to get up and function. We had reporters, Daily Mail reporters especially, camped out in front of my house for two weeks. I had to leave — left the state, actually, for a few days, to get them to go away and leave my children and my family alone. After those two weeks, I was chomping at the bit to go out and start door-knocking again and meeting voters and campaigning.

On Sept. 7, when there was that first contact with the reporter — did you immediately know, “Oh, this is what they’re talking about, how could they possibly know about this?” Or was it just sort of, “What on earth is this?” Can you narrate that moment?

So, they called and spoke with my media consultant. I was seeing patients in clinic and I got three phone calls in a row within a minute of each other. I always keep my phone with me in clinic just because my kids have severe food allergies. The first two, it was just coincidental and had nothing to do with this, but they were in the political world. The third call was my media consultant. So, I picked up.

I was like, “Well, what is going on? Is everything okay, because I’m seeing a patient?” He said, “No, everything is not okay.” And he told me that this particular reporter was looking for my phone number but wouldn’t tell him what it was about. She had told him, ‘I don’t want to tell you, you don’t know what it’s about. It’s personal. She’s a mother. I don’t want to have to discuss this with you. I don’t want to go after her.” I really appreciated that respectfulness of her, by the way, but they went back and forth. Finally, I had to text and say: “Please tell him anything and everything, my full permission — I’m in clinic.”

But no, I had no idea. This was not what came to mind at all. I sat there racking my brain and then thought that it could be from this. But I still wasn’t sure until the Washington Post reporter came two days later to a canvas launch — where I had my daughter, by the way. My manager intercepted her. He said, “Well, I don’t even know what you have. You don’t even know what that is.” And she started texting with them.

Can I ask you how your family and your friends responded to the Post story?

We spent a few days fighting with them, two days or so, a day and a half —

Sorry, “fighting with them” — meaning, the Post?

Fighting with the Post. I hired an amazing attorney who worked around the clock and wrote them several letters, essentially saying: To be clear, Ms. Gibson never acknowledged or consented to videos being recorded, this is illegal pornography because it is illegal to record someone in a state of undress without consent.

It was a few days of feeling hopeful, then swung from hopeful to devastated. How can this be happening? How can a national news outlet decide to run a story about this? I think if I wasn’t a candidate, the Post probably would have been appalled at the invasion of my privacy. But because I was a candidate, they decided that it was a political story, rather than an invasion of my privacy and potentially a crime.

You said, “invasion of your privacy.” How much do you feel like people in general should be free to live really separate lives online?

So, this is interesting. I think this is going to continue to happen as millennials age into running for office. There was a 2014 study conducted by McAfee that said or showed that 90 percent of millennial women have taken nude photos at some point. This is something that is very common, especially in the younger generations.

I think a big underlying factor that really needs to be addressed, and our society needs to start being educated on, is there is this devaluation and misunderstanding of consent, especially when we’re talking about digital privacy. Content that is initially made in a consensual context, which is then distributed in a non-consensual context digitally, is a crime. Just because someone consented to share something in one particular context doesn’t mean that it is or should be fair game for the whole world to see.

Choosing to share content, online or in whatever medium, with select people with the understanding that it will disappear and can only be seen by those present at the time — when we’re talking live streaming, webcamming and Skype — that is a far cry from consenting for that content to be recorded and then broadly disseminated. And there is case law precedent confirming this.

You referred before to the Post treating this as a story because you’re a candidate — that their view, as you put it, was that it was not an invasion of privacy, it was a political story because you’re a candidate. Separate and apart from what the legal questions involved are, how much do you feel like there ought to be a bigger barrier between what people do digitally and the way they are assessed as people in their non-digital lives?

How strongly I would have felt about this before this actually happened to me — who knows? I think I would probably feel the same way, but just not quite as strongly.

I think what people do in their private lives, digitally — if it is legal, it is consensual and has no bearing on their ability to do their jobs — I think there should be a barrier. I think that it is unethical to make people’s private lives — especially their sexual private lives — public and part of how we think about them and their ability to do their jobs and make positive contributions to their communities.

The part that strikes me as tricky is that there certainly are things that people do online that we do want to be able to assess in a political context or make part of the public record on that person, right?

If it had to do with policy.

Or if you had been writing racist rants on the internet or something, I don’t think anybody would say, “Whoa, that’s a protected private space” — right? I think defining that line is the hard part.

I think that anything that has to do with people’s families — point blank, period — should not be. And I think that anything that has to do with nudity or sexuality, there needs to be a barrier there.

We know that when images, particularly that have to do with sexuality and nudity, because of our society’s particular interest in those things — our prurient interest — the moment that an image like that or a video like that gets put on the internet, it’s like lighting a fire in a dry forest. It spreads rapidly and extensively until it causes irreversible damage. I think anything, especially that has to do with sexuality — there needs to be a significant barrier there, because of the damage that it can do. It’s a breach of trust and a breach of dignity — the right to dignity and privacy and sexual autonomy.

There are scholars that argue that non-consensual pornography really should be relabeled and called image-based sexual abuse, because of the damage that it causes. We know that victims of sexual abuse experience significant mental health issues, they experience damage to their reputation, social isolation, breakdown of relationships and friendships and loss of current or future employment.

Have you suffered irreversible damage?

I would say I’ve fundamentally changed as a human, as a professional. Very few people understand what it is like to be afraid to leave your home because you have had people parked in front of your house or driving through your cul-de-sac or coming up to your door and ringing the doorbell. That damage is something that, depending on how people process trauma, can really do a number on them. We see increased risk of suicide, certainly of suicidal ideation, in victims of non-consensual pornography or image-based sexual abuse.

So, yeah, I would say I’m fundamentally changed as a human having gone through something like that.

I’m curious whether there was ever a point, in either responding to the initial story or in the balance of the campaign, where you felt tempted to take a more defiant approach to responding to this and say, “You know what, you’re damn right I did it. It was a harmless activity and you’re a bunch of creeps for talking about it.”

[Laughs] Well, I did not do everything that they said I did. But you know, and to people’s point, they were correct in saying: Hey, don’t give it air.

It’s something that kind of shook a lot of people in the political sphere, in our social sphere in the community. But then, after that kind of shock wore off — of such a salacious story — voters started not caring. They care much more about what I can do for them and the issues that affect them every day, which is why you even saw the Republican Party of Virginia, loudly and proudly, take credit for and send out mailers that contained images and verbiage from these videos. I mean, that’s appalling.

I want everyone to stop for a second and take a step back from this particular story and take more of a long-lens view of what actually happened in the way this Post article was written. A political operative found sexually explicit videos of a young woman running for office that she never knew existed — and we made that pretty clear in our statement — and shopped them around to various news outlets, trying to get them published to humiliate, intimidate, coerce, harass this woman, and with the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election that very well could have been the majority maker or breaker for the House.

There are legal experts who argue that this is a violation of federal and state laws: possession of illegal pornography, dissemination of illegal pornography across state lines, violating revenge porn laws. But the way our nation more ultimately interprets that and reads that story, it’s the young woman that’s nationally blamed, shamed, harassed, bullied, threatened, all of the above. There’s very little discussion — I saw no discussion in this in particular — of blaming and shaming the political operative.

When the media, the press, labels and reports on something as a scandal — using that word “scandal” — it dismisses the seriousness of the situation and essentially shifts and puts that blame on the victim.

Did you observe any variation, based on generation or based on gender, in how voters responded to the story?

Yes. It’s interesting. Younger voters don’t care. Very, very few of them, I would say. My age and younger, maybe even mid-40s up to 50 or so, didn’t care. I’m a millennial, I’m the oldest possible millennial — 90 percent of millennials have taken nude photos. So, I think we all understand.

When I was in college, probably when you were in college, there was all this, “Oh no, there will be photos of people drinking on the internet when they run for Congress later on.” That’s totally quaint now, right? Or, I mean, this is a very different situation but the original Anthony Weiner scandal — not the one that landed him in jail, but the initial DMing, you know, a lewd photo —

I just finished Huma Abedin’s memoir, have you read it?

No, I haven’t.

Oh my God, I actually have to write to her because she describes something that was really poignant for me, about how she was pregnant — she was early in her pregnancy, hadn’t told her friends and family — and The New York Times got wind of this story that she was pregnant. She was just absolutely horrified that something so private and personal was going to be revealed to her family and friends through reading about it in The New York Times. That loss of control, how damaging and traumatizing that was for her.

I don’t know that a congressman caught in Weiner’s position would have to resign, right? Because it’s 12 years later. There’s no novelty factor to it, anymore.

That’s what I tell people about what happened to me. This was bound to happen to some young woman. This was inevitable. And my hope is that I can prevent it from happening to other women down the road, but also that, hopefully, it has absorbed some of that shock value and will make it easier if it does happen.

How supported did you feel by the Democratic Party in the final months of your campaign?

Some people were wonderful. Sen. Louise Lucas, immediately, as soon as she heard what happened, jumped and said: “This is not OK, let’s rally around her and help her.” She’s been wonderful, in particular. There are several others that have been.

We had several partners — Planned Parenthood, Repro Rising, ACLU, Equality Virginia — they were really wonderful to me and rallied behind me, particularly the repro groups. And I felt very much supported by them. They had volunteers flying in from Minnesota, specifically because they wanted to knock for me. We had support.

There were certainly people that didn’t know how to process this and kind of shied away from being actively involved. And I’m disappointed. That’s not just in the party or in these particular people but just in general — disappointment that this happened. It never should have happened. It never should have been on the scale that it was.

What do you draw from the fact that the race was so close in the end?

That voters didn’t care. The Republican Party in Virginia never would have sent those mailers if they didn’t know I was going to win or certainly could win.

I stopped working [at the clinic] the last two months of the campaign after the story came out. I was always going to take some time off; I took more time off than originally intended and I knocked, on average, 100 doors a day for two months. You have conversations with voters and you can kind of tell who knew and who didn’t know, and who knew and didn’t care. Very few people actually seemed to care — very few. I can count them on less than two hands.

They cared about reproductive rights. They cared about gun violence and having their kids get the best quality education and being able to come home from school safely. Those are the things they care about. They care about being able to afford their home. They care about having transportation. After the initial shock wore off, I think it had little to do with the race.

Are you still considering legal action?

Yes. I want the person who found and then disseminated illegal pornographic images of me — again, violating federal and state laws — they need to be held accountable. I’m working with a few members in the General Assembly in Virginia right now to amend Virginia’s current revenge porn law, particularly to remove intent or motives, because intent is so hard to prove in a court of law, and also to increase the penalty from a misdemeanor. If we don’t do that, what is the deterrence for people?

I think we also need, on a federal level, to push for legislation that covers the non-consensual distribution and sexual privacy of intimate material in every single way.

How optimistic are you that you will be able to hold the person accountable?

I’ve told people this forever, but it’s true: When I decide to do something, I will work and work and work — I will outwork everyone. I will make sure it happens.

It’s going to be a long process. Subpoenas take a long time. But there is a special victims detective who also has FBI privileges looking into it now. She has been for about a month now. I’m optimistic.",political

Hannah Waddingham: Home for Christmas

Audiences in the US mostly know Hannah Waddingham as Rebecca Welton on Ted Lasso, but those who frequent London's West End theaters also know her as a regular in shows like The Wizard of Oz and Into the Woods. With Home for Christmas, Waddingham brings all of those skills to the stage for a performance that includes guest stars Luke Evans, Leslie Odom Jr., the English National Opera, and the London Gay Men's Chorus.

Fingernails

Can technology determine whether you've found The One? Probably not, but in the latest from writer-director Christos Nikou, an institute run by Duncan (Luke Wilson) claims that it has found the formula for true love anyway—and Anna (Jessie Buckley) wants to figure out if it's real. The institute, you see, has determined that Anna and her boyfriend Ryan (Jeremy Allan White) are a match, but has doubts. While working at the institute, though, she meets Amir (Riz Ahmed) and finds someone who actually might be her match.

Flora and Son

Remember Sing Street, that charming indie about a kid in Dublin who starts a band as an escape from his complicated home life? What about Once, that charming indie about a pair that spends a week in Dublin writing songs about their love? If you enjoyed either of those—or if they just sound like something you might enjoy—let us suggest Flora and Son, a charming indie about a mother in Dublin trying to connect with her son through song. Like Sing Street and Once, Flora and Son comes from director John Carney and has all of his signature moves, plus something else: Eve Hewson, who plays the movie's titular mom. She's a force, and she hits all of her musician notes perfectly. Makes sense, she's Bono's daughter.

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown

Yes, this film is from 1966, but as the air turns crisp and fall approaches, watching It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is a must. While seasonal movies featuring the Peanuts gang used to air on network TV, Apple scored the rights to the franchise in 2020, meaning anyone with an account can stream them at any time. This year, Apple is also offering It's the Great Pumpkin free to nonsubscribers October 21 and 22. Gather ’round the screen and wait with Linus for a pumpkin patch miracle.

The Beanie Bubble

Here it is, the question everyone will ask when you’re writing about Apple TV+’s new original movie: Do you remember Beanie Babies? If you were born after 2000, the answer is likely no, unless you have a retro toy collector friend or a goofy aunt who has a few of them lying around. The good news is that The Beanie Bubble is for those fans and everyone else too. It’s about a toy salesman named Ty Warner (Zack Galifianakis) who stumbles into the biggest success of his life after he teams up with three women to develop the kind of plushies people just can’t get enough of. Critics have been mixed, but thanks to performances from the likes of Galifianakis, Elizabeth Banks, and Sarah Snook (proving there’s life after Succession), it’s the kind of sweet dramedy that’s perfect for a night in.

Stephen Curry: Underrated

Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry might be one of the most beloved players in American basketball—and he is definitely one of the best players, if not the best player, in the league. He's been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player twice and has won four championship rings. He also has more career three-pointers than anyone in the league. But in the late aughts, he was a kid at a small school, Davidson College, just trying to live up to the potential his coaches saw in him. Underrated, directed by Peter Nicks (Homeroom), chronicles that journey, showing how Curry bested the predictions of his own NBA draft (many said he didn't have the size necessary for the league) to become one of the greatest to ever play the game. For basketball fans, it's a must-watch.

Beastie Boys Story

One of the pioneering groups in hip hop, the Beastie Boys have a story like no other. For this “live documentary,” filmmaker Spike Jonze filmed Mike Diamond (Mike D) and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) as they told a crowd at Brooklyn’s Kings Theater about their rise to stardom. Complete with old footage, photos, and stories from the group’s decades-long career, the doc captures just how influential the Beasties have been since they started playing music together as kids in New York City in the late ’70s and early ’80s. It also features some wonderful memories of their third member, Adam “MCA” Yauch, who died in 2012 following a battle with cancer.

CODA

This is the one that put Apple TV+ on the map. The movie’s title is an acronym for “child of deaf adults.” It’s the story of Ruby, the only hearing person in a family that includes two deaf parents and one deaf sibling. When Ruby discovers a love of music, she's forced to reconcile her own aspirations with those of her family, who run a small fishing business and often need her to help communicate. Warm and gripping, CODA is the kind of movie that will have you cheering and crying at the same time.

Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie

In 1985, Michael J. Fox was one of Hollywood’s biggest names as the star of a hit TV show (Family Ties) and the year’s highest-grossing movie (Back to the Future). Just a few years later, at the age of 29, Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. In Still, Oscar-winning documentarian Davis Guggenheim offers a poignant portrait of Fox’s personal and professional life, and his journey from teen idol to advocate for a cure.

Swan Song

Mahershala Ali stars alongside, well, Mahershala Ali in this romantic-sci-fi-drama. Yes, it’s all of those things. Cameron (Ali) is a loving husband (to Naomie Harris) and father who, after learning he has a terminal illness, must decide just how far he’ll go to protect his family from having to know the truth, or deal with the devastating aftermath.

Sharper

Sharper is one of those movies where the less you know about it going in, the better. Just know that no one is what they seem or who they say they are in this neo-noir starring Julianne Moore, Sebastian Stan, Justice Smith, and John Lithgow. This twisty little thriller flew largely under the radar when it was released in theaters for a half-second in early 2023.

Ghosted

If you’ve read the reviews, you know this movie isn’t exactly good, per se, but if you want to see Captain America (Chris Evans) and a future John Wick–franchise badass (Ana de Armas) fall in love as part of the goofiest premise possible—He’s a farmer! She’s a secret agent!—this is for you. Give this movie a go(sted).

The World’s a Little Blurry

By now, thousands of pop music fans know the Billie Eilish monomyth: Young, slightly punk, slightly goth teenager starts making songs in her brother’s bedroom, puts them online, and becomes one of the biggest pop stars in the world. It’s a great story, but that’s only about a quarter of the tale of Eilish’s ascent to superstar status. The World’s a Little Blurry fills in (some of) the blanks. Director R. J. Cutler got amazing access for this film, which chronicles everything from Eilish’s songwriting process with her brother Finneas to her frank talk about her Tourette’s. It’s the kind of music documentary that redefines the music documentary.

Cha Cha Real Smooth

“Sundance hit starring Dakota Johnson”s are almost a dime a dozen, but this one, about a young bar/bat mitzvah party-starter is the, ahem, real deal. It also proves that Cooper Raiff—who writes, directs, and stars in the movie—is one to keep your eye on.

The Tragedy of Macbeth

Yes, most people already know the story of Macbeth—Scottish lord with an eye toward ruling his country—but not everyone has seen it through the eyes of director Joel Coen. Shot entirely in black and white and starring Denzel Washington as Macbeth and Frances McDormand as his powerful wife, the film was nominated for three Oscars and brought a very new twist onto a classic Shakespearean tale.

Louis Armstrong’s Black & Blues

Above all else, Louis Armstrong is known as one of the most famous jazz musicians of all time. But he was also a figure in the struggle for equality in America—albeit a complicated one. As director Sacha Jenkins illustrates in this documentary, while Armstrong broke racial barriers in entertainment he also faced accusations that he didn’t stand up as much for civil rights as other performers of his era. Jenkins got access to scores of photographs, clippings, and even recordings Armstrong made of his own conversations for this documentary, and that access provides a much fuller picture of the legendary musician than the world has ever had.

Tetris

One of the most popular video games of all time, Tetris was a phenomenon for Nintendo Game Boy owners in the 1980s. But Tetris (the movie) is the story of the people who made the game and brought it from the then-Soviet Union to the rest of the world. Part historical dramedy, part espionage flick, the movie doesn’t always hit its marks, but if you’ve never heard the story of how Tetris got out from behind the Iron Curtain, it’s worth a watch.

Causeway

Causeway kind of came and went when it was released in 2022, but that’s also the sort of movie it is. Focused on a soldier (Jennifer Lawrence) who returns home after suffering a brain injury in Afghanistan, the film from director Lila Neugebauer is about trauma and how people lean on each other to get through it. A worthy watch for the times when you have your own stuff to work through.

Sidney

Sidney Poitier died in 2022, the same year Apple TV+ released this documentary looking at the actor’s long-running career—In the Heat of the Night, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner—and impact on American culture and politics. With interviews ranging from Spike Lee and Morgan Freeman to Harry Belafonte, the film goes beyond his time in Hollywood, starting with his upbringing in the Bahamas and ending with his massive impact on the civil rights movement and elsewhere.",technology
"McCarthy, who clinched the speakership after 15 votes in January, was ousted from his position in October after hard-right conservatives lodged an effort to displace him. They publicly said that his work with Democrats to keep the government open defied a deal over how Republicans would approach negotiating the budget. And Trump, who still looms large over a prominent group of populist conservatives in the House, did little to stave off the effort in McCarthy’s hour of need.

And McCarthy didn’t even ask for his help.

The pair have had a tumultuous relationship for years, from McCarthy expressing that Trump bore responsibility for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol to him appearing at the former president’s side weeks later in a renewed endorsement. And now, McCarthy appears ready to ride by Trump’s side as 2024 arrives, while other Republicans on the Hill brace for another Trump presidency. Other contenders in the GOP primary race have failed to gain meaningful traction in a race that Trump has dominated.

In another sign of warmth towards the former president, the California Republican also said that he would serve in a Trump cabinet — if he gets a good spot.

“In the right position, if I am the best person for the job, yes,” McCarthy said. “I worked with President Trump on a lot of policy. We worked together to win the majority.”

The Trump campaign, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, released a forcefully worded statement on Friday that allies should not speculate about potential administration appointments. That message was released in apparent response to media reports that Trump was poised to pick an array of far-right voices to prominent positions in a second administration.

“People publicly discussing potential administration jobs for themselves or their friends are, in fact, hurting President Trump … and themselves,” the campaign said in a statement on Friday. “These are an unwelcomed distraction.”",political
"Nvidia released its Ada Lovelace architecture in October 2022, starting with the GeForce RTX 4090 and then following up with additional variants. Prices have increased compared to the previous generation, some more than others, but these are still some of the best graphics cards currently available, with the 4090 occupying the top spot on our GPU benchmarks hierarchy.

But right from the start, we knew that Nvidia was holding back, saving room for a potential RTX 4090 Ti or a new Titan RTX Ada. Here's what we know about the future uber-GPUs of the Ada generation.



Nvidia currently has three desktop Ada GPUs in production, the AD102, AD103, and AD104 that are used in the RTX 4090, RTX 4080, and RTX 4070 Ti, respectively. It also has mobile RTX 40-series GPUs now in production that range from the entry-level RTX 4050 mobile up to the RTX 4090, which add the smaller AD106 and AD107 chips into the mix — though note that the mobile 4090 uses the same chip as the desktop 4080. The RTX 4090 Ti and Titan RTX Ada, depending on which way Nvidia decides to go, will naturally land at the top of the stack, and as such will also use the AD102 chip.



Right now, the RTX 4090, for all its performance and power, only uses a portion of the full AD102 GPU. It's a large portion, to be sure, with 128 out of a possible 144 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) enabled — 89% of the GPU cores, in other words. Except Nvidia also disabled 1MB of L2 cache on each of the twelve 32-bit memory interfaces, giving it 75% of the maximum L2 cache. All it needs to do is to turn on those missing pieces, and perhaps even crank up the clock speeds and power draw a bit, and we end up with a new, even faster RTX 4090 Ti.



And make no mistake, Nvidia already has basically fully functional AD102 chips in the wild. The professional Nvidia RTX 6000 Ada Generation, for instance, has 142 of the 144 SMs turned on, plus the full 96MB of L2 cache. Except power draw is capped at a 'meager' 300W, which means the card generally won't run as fast for as long — not actually a bad approach, but we already know that with a bit more power and voltage, it's possible to get most Ada chips to run at closer to 3.0 GHz. That's effectively what we expect to see from a future RTX 4090 Ti and/or Titan RTX Ada.

The currently rumored specs are basically similar to what we see with the RTX 6000 Ada Generation, but now with double the TGP (Total Graphics Power) and a slightly higher boost clock on the 4090 Ti, or even a significantly higher 800W power limit for the Titan RTX Ada.



The higher TGPs of course means these cards would be far more likely to hit the rated boost clocks. And if they're like other RTX 40-series desktop GPUs, it's more than likely they'll far exceed the boost clocks. Our testing of RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti cards to date has shown that real-world gaming boost clocks often average closer to 200 MHz above the official boost clock.



Everything else follows from the core counts and boost clock. In terms of raw specs, if the rumors are correct, the RTX 4090 Ti will hit peak throughput of 95.4 teraflops for FP32 work, and up to 1.5 petaflops for FP8 computations on the Tensor cores. That's 15% faster than the RTX 4090 in both cases.



To help the card sustain maximum throughput, the GDDR6X memory will also get bumped up to 24 Gbps, 14% faster than the 21 Gbps memory used with the RTX 4090. Coupled with 33% more L2 cache, the memory subsystem should be well-equipped to keep the rest of the GPU fed with data.



The Titan RTX Ada rumors are less solid, and currently show a 2520 MHz boost clock — the same as the RTX 4090. Given it's also supposed to have dual 16-pin power connectors and an 800W TGP, however, we would expect such a card (if it actually comes out) to push for even higher clocks. What we've seen of the latest GDDR6X 24 Gbps modules from Micron suggests power and heat from the memory won't be nearly as problematic as it was on the earlier RTX 3090, even with chips on both sides of the PCB.



There's still the power to contend with, however, and even if the cards don't always hit 600W/800W, they're likely to push well above 500W when running demanding games at 4K and maxed out settings. We've already seen that happen with the RTX 4090 cards we've reviewed once we manually overclocked them, but the 4090 Ti / Titan Ada will make that the norm rather than an OC.

Supposedly an image of the Titan RTX Ada, via YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead (Image credit: Moore’s Law is Dead)

Coping with that much power will require an exceptional cooling subsystem. We generally found the RTX 4090's triple-slot cooling to be adequate, but there are images and leaks floating around the web showing a quad-slot gold cooler. Perhaps they're fakes, but the extra slot width plus the gold coloring suggests we're more likely than not looking at a new Titan RTX Ada rather than an RTX 4090 Ti — or maybe Nvidia will do both, although the 4090 Ti would likely have a silver cooler. It's too early to say for certain how everything will play out.



The 4-slot Nvidia RTX 4090 Ti / Titan RTX Ada card images look comically large, and considering even the existing RTX 4090 already starts hitting CPU limits in many games at anything below 4K (at least if the game doesn't have ray tracing), this definitely feels like Nvidia is getting ready to jump the shark. Hopefully Nvidia provides an extra sturdy IO bracket (secured to the top and bottom of the cooler) that covers all four slots to help prevent sag. Or maybe Nvidia will just include a kickstand of some form like many of its AIB partners have elected to do with the RTX 4090.



That just leaves the pricing and release date, neither of which are known yet. Given the leaks of the cooler, we could see the new halo card within the next month or two, or Nvidia may hold out for a summer or even fall launch window, letting the card serve as the mid-cycle refresh at the top of the RTX 40-series stack. Launching at either GDC (in March) or the next GTC (also in March) is certainly a possibility, particularly if Nvidia opts for the ""prosumer and creator"" target market with a new Titan RTX Ada, and it could hold the RTX 4090 Ti for a later date.



Pricing will naturally be ridiculous. Any hope of a future RTX 4090 Ti or Titan RTX Ada card carrying a reasonable price tag basically went out the window when the RTX 4090 cards were routinely sold out or priced above $2,000 for the first three months after launch. We still suspect a lot of that came from professional users who were willing to pay more for top performance in AI and other computational workloads, and a 4090 Ti or Titan RTX Ada would cater to those same users.



If Nvidia goes with GeForce RTX 4090 Ti branding, it will probably set the price at $1,999. For a new Titan RTX Ada, $2,499 or even $2,999 seems likely. A Titan would offer most of what the RTX 6000 Ada already provides (depending on the VRAM capacity), plus higher clocks thanks to the increased TGP, and three grand would still be less than half the price of the true professional GPU. Those who are only interested in bragging rights at any price also appear to have sufficient funds to pay whatever Nvidia asks.

(Image credit: Nvidia)

The rest of us can stick with more reasonable GPUs, like a replacement for the RTX 3060 Ti — or just wait for the inevitable RTX 50-series, which will probably arrive in late 2024. Because if there's one thing we know for certain, it's that no matter how fast the future RTX 4090 Ti and/or Titan RTX Ada end up being, at some point Nvidia will release an RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 (or some other name, perhaps) that will provide even higher performance than what the fastest Ada Lovelace graphics card can hope to deliver.



If we're lucky, maybe the current downturn in GPU and PC sales will even spur more aggressive pricing for a change. That happened, in theory at least, with the RTX 3080 in 2020. It's too bad cryptocurrency mining and the pandemic ended up ruining prices for the next two years and influencing the current round of higher prices.



We do at least have a codename for Ada's successor: Blackwell, presumably after David Harold Blackwell, a mathematician and statistician who specialized in game theory and information theory. Except we don't know for certain if Blackwell is solely a future Hopper replacement (for the data center market), or if it will span both the data center and consumer markets, similar to Ampere. Considering Ada Lovelace is only a few months old, pinning our sights on Blackwell at this stage seems a bit premature.",technology

Nordic workers aren't happy with Elon Musk's Tesla — and they're showing their displeasure.

After Swedish workers began a strike earlier this fall against Musk's electric vehicle giant, many comrades in neighboring countries are now either standing in solidarity or preparing to do so.

Mechanics servicing Teslas in Sweden, who started striking in October, were joined by dockworkers and colleagues in car dealerships in a mounting anti-Tesla campaign. And help is now also starting to arrive from across Nordic borders.

Swedish union IF Metall has been pushing Tesla to sign a collective agreement on wages and working conditions. It threatens that the strike will go on until a deal is reached.

Continental union bosses are clear on how they feel about Musk, and they also want the EU to get involved.

""It's time for the European Union to step up and become tougher on Musk,"" Claes-Mikael Ståhl, deputy general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, told POLITICO.

'Hostile to workers'

Nordic unions are annoyed with Tesla — owned by billionaire entrepreneur Musk, who also owns social media platform X and astronautics company SpaceX — and are starting to help their Swedish counterparts.

Danish transport union 3F Transport on Tuesday started blocking Teslas from being transported through Denmark en route to Sweden, after a request from IF Metall, according to Danish broadcaster DR.

On Wednesday, the Norwegian union Fellesforbundet said it would boycott Teslas bound for Sweden passing through Norwegian harbors, if Tesla does not acquiesce to IF Metall's demands by December 20.

Finnish transport union AKT joined in on Thursday, saying it too would block Teslas coming through Finnish harbors if no deal was reached by December 20. ""It is a crucial part of the Nordic labor market model that we have collective agreements and unions support each other,"" Ismo Kokko, president of AKT, said in a statement.

Nordic unions aren't the only workers challenging Musk. In the U.S. the United Auto Workers union is pushing to unionize Tesla workers, as the company has faced accusations of union busting.

It's also a growing issue for Tesla in Germany, where it has a gigafactory near Berlin. IG Metall, Germany’s largest union, said it is seeing a rise in signups from Tesla workers concerned about their working conditions.

Musk has recently addressed his distaste for unions | Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images

IG Metall boss Christiane Benner warned Musk about his anti-union views in an October interview with Bloomberg, saying: “You need to be careful. The rules of the game are different here.”

Jørn Eggum, leader of Norway's Fellesforbundet, said: ""It's a collective battle, in our view. There is no doubt Tesla is a company hostile to workers. Tesla is systematically undermining efforts to unionize and is trying to implement U.S. conditions in Europe.""

Eggum is clear that Fellesforbundet will enter the fray if Tesla tries to steer cars through Norwegian harbors. ""We will take action to block them,"" he vowed.

Fellesforbundet has been joined by the Danish industry union Dansk Metal in its show of support. ""In Dansk Metal we would have liked to see Nordic coordination to put as much pressure on Tesla as possible,"" said René Nielsen, vice president of Dansk Metal.

The Danish union is following the action in Sweden closely, Nielsen added. ""We are currently assessing what actions we might be able to take in Denmark,"" he warned.

In a sign of a widening problem, PensionDenmark said it would be dumping its Tesla shares, becoming the first Nordic institutional investor to sell the carmaker’s stock in response to the dispute.

Tesla did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.

However, Musk has recently addressed his distaste for unions, saying in New York last week: “I disagree with the idea of unions. I just don’t like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing. I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company.”

Prepared for a long conflict

As for the guys who started the action against Tesla, they are digging in for a long strike.

""We are prepared for this conflict to take a very long time before we get a collective agreement,"" said Jesper Pettersson, a spokesperson for IF Metall.

And the backing from unions across Europe has not gone unnoticed. ""We are getting incredibly strong support from our Nordic friends. It's very important and we are grateful for it,"" Pettersson said.

Despite his status as an EV market leader, Musk is not doing his part in the green transition, according to Stahl from ETUC.

Green jobs and production also have to be on good terms for workers. ""It's the world's richest man, and he obviously can't afford to pay workers accordingly,"" he said.",political
"Transcript

I'm Jillian Peterson.

I'm a criminologist and former investigator.

Let's answer some questions from the internet.

This is True Crime Support.

[upbeat music]

@BecomingJill asks, Isn't the spouse

always the first suspect?

When it comes to women being murdered, yes.

35 to 50% of them are murdered

by either a current spouse or partner

or a former spouse or partner.

So if you can rule out things like a robbery gone bad,

a drug deal gone bad, a fight that escalated, gang violence,

if you can rule all those things out,

definitely your next most likely suspect

is going to be the spouse.

@jojishii asked, Did you know

that 1% of cold cases are solved?

Our current clearance rate for murder

in this country is only about 50%.

If you commit a murder, it's kind of flip of the coin

whether or not you get arrested for it.

Our clearance weights are way down.

I think it has to do with we've seen such an increase

in homicide the last few years,

and with that we've had a decrease

just in the number of police officers we have.

It's a lot more than 1% of cases that are unsolved.

@BrotherGrimmBo asked, Did Jack the Ripper exist

or was Victorian England just kind of stabby?

Jack the River did exist,

committed a series of really violent gruesome murders.

So as an example, just to show what it was like

during that period of time, this is a news report from 1888.

I think it really shows that Victorian England

was a rather stabby place during this period of time.

There's actually another serial killer

who was operating at the time named Thomas Cream.

He was convicted of poisoning 9 or 10 people

during the exact same period of time.

During his execution,

his final words are rumored to be I am Jack...

Although he was actually in prison

at the time of some of the murders,

so it really couldn't have been him,

and we still don't know exactly who Jack the Ripper is.

@Ms_L_Simpson asked, My sister just sent me a message

to say that she listened to a podcast

and is going off to try to solve a murder.

Who needs the police?

Yes, this is a thing,

where individuals listen to podcasts

and they think, I can solve this.

It's known as Citizen Sleuths.

The January 6th riots,

a lot of the individuals

who ended up being criminally charged or identified

by citizen sleuths on social media trying to identify them.

In the case of the Gabby Petito murder,

who was killed by Brian Laundrie, her fiance,

she was missing for a long period of time.

It was really a group of young people

on TikTok that started uploading videos

of the park where she went missing.

The van was spotted.

And they were really able to locate her body

and isolate where she was located.

However, if you talk to most police officers,

they will say they do not like this movement

of citizen sleuths, that oftentimes

they can go down rabbit holes

and end up accusing people who are truly innocent,

and that can really destroy lives.

@NerminMans46302 asked, Why do serial killers kill?

I wanna study their brain so badly.

Generally, we can say there's three big categories.

One being power and control.

I think one example of a power and control serial killer

might be somebody like the Zodiac Killer

who was attacking primarily young couples.

It was really about murdering people

who were kind of in the prime of their life.

One is a sexual motivation, sexual fantasy.

The sexual fantasy category is often people

who are sexually aroused by violence

or sexually aroused by having sex with bodies

after they've killed them.

One example of somebody motivated

by sexual fantasy would be Ted Bundy.

The third category would be a serial killer

motivated by hallucinations.

Good example of that would be like the Son of Sam killer

who was motivated by delusions.

There has been some studies of, mostly murderer's brains.

We do see some differences,

particularly in an area called the amygdala,

which is a part of the brain that controls things

like fear and aggression.

It's hard to say that that's causal.

It's the brain that causes the behavior,

the behavior that causes changes in the brain.

But there does seem to be something there

in some of these early studies.

@codesmithio asked, Why have murders increased

during the COVID-19 pandemic?

We saw a massive spike in homicide during COVID-19.

The biggest year-on-year increase

in homicide we've ever seen since we started tracking this.

It was about a third increase or a 30% jump.

Other forms of crime went down,

but homicides specifically spiked.

Could be because people weren't working.

There was financial strain, there was stress.

There's also this thing that happened

where George Floyd was murdered.

A lot of cities started pulling back their policing,

that's sometimes referred to as de-policing,

so it's really hard to pull apart

which of these factors was the main driver.

It was likely all of it at once.

@LiPerezRey asked,

Is #Merica the best at murder in the whole world?

We are a standout when it comes to murder.

If you look at other countries similar to ours,

so places in Europe, Canada, Australia,

most countries are under 1 homicide per 100,000 residents.

The United States is at 4.382.

We aren't the worst in the entire world.

There are other countries per capita

in Latin America who do have a higher rate than us.

Places like Honduras, Mexico, Jamaica.

But when it comes to sort of similarly developed countries,

America really stands out.

@TriciaMcKeown13 asked, Could a psychopath

go through life without giving any sign

or will there always be something that is a giveaway,

some wee trait?

Yes, you can go through life

and not know that someone is a psychopath.

You see high rates of psychopathy in industries

like the entertainment industry,

law enforcement, law, politics.

Being a serial killer, being violent,

committing crime is actually not one of the symptoms.

It's what we tend to think of when we think of psychopaths.

There really isn't anything

like killing animals or setting fires

that's gonna be a tell.

If I was going to name one thing that might be a giveaway,

it would be a trouble reading other people's emotions

and maybe mimicking back emotions

without really feeling those emotions.

@thackerayarty says, Okay, can someone please tell me

the difference between a sociopath

and a psychopath, please?

There's really no clear distinction.

Sociopath is a word that was used more in the '80s

and the '90s.

It's used less today.

It's used maybe by the media and in pop culture,

but as the criminology field,

we've really moved towards psychopathy

being the thing that we look for,

that we can define,

clinically, that we know how to test for.

And so the field has just gone more in the direction

of using psychopath as opposed to sociopath.

@David75983862 asks, So, since the early '90s,

why have gun murder rate gone down

while the number of guns has significantly increased?

I might disagree on this one.

Our murder rate in the '90s was extremely high.

Then we did see a big dip in the 2000, 2010.

So it was sort of high in the '90s,

it went down, and then the last five years,

and particularly the last two years,

we've really seen it spark back up again.

During that period of time,

gun ownership increased in this country over time,

particularly the last couple of years.

So we now have more guns than people in this country.

About 120 Americans are killed by guns every day.

That would include homicides, suicides,

accidents, police shootings, but about 120 people total.

@TheFlyingnipple asks, Terrifying!

I wonder how many unexplained missing persons there are.

It's about half a million people a year go missing.

That is down from maybe a million a year

back in the '90s.

But estimates are about 90% of them are found.

Most of them are young people running away from home,

but 10% of that half million missing

still leaves 50,000 people who are missing

and unaccounted for every year.

Csiegs01 asks, Real question,

what percentage of mass shooters are male?

The answer is 98% of mass shooters are male.

@_truth_orDARe asks, My question about these mass shooters

is this, why schools?

Whether it's an elementary, middle, or high school,

what attracts you to kill children?

About 91, 92% of them are actually students at that school.

So this is people targeting their own school

or they might be former students,

but most likely they're current students.

They're 15, 16 years old.

My own research shows that these perpetrators

come from homes with lots of violence and abuse.

They tend to study other perpetrators

who are like them and feel like they're a part of them,

and then they target their own school

because that's where they have the grievance against.

Those are the people that they blame for their misery.

School shootings are designed to be final acts.

So perpetrators go in

knowing they're not gonna come out of it, and in fact,

they want to be known for this.

They're craving that notoriety.

They want their name

in the history books.

@_SnackTime asks, 'Murdoch Murders'

is such a crazy series on Netflix.

Like how in the world did these people

get away with all of this?

Alex Murdoch has been convicted of killing his wife

and his child, and there's also other murders

that he may or may not be guilty of,

including a housekeeper.

I think this is a good example

of how in these small communities,

it can be really hard to have

an independent criminal investigation,

especially if somebody who has a lot of status and power

in the town.

And it's really important

that who's ever investigating a crime

has absolutely no relationship with any of the suspects

because once that starts getting mixed,

you see mistakes getting made,

and it could be a conscious bias

but oftentimes it's just unconscious

because of the preconceived notions

that you have about people.

@Bookmarkquinn asked, Do you not worry

that all the criminology television programs

that are on these days,

that the criminals will learn from it and avoid detection?

We've seen television programs having an effect

on the everyday public.

We refer to this as the CSI Effect,

in the criminal justice system,

where people sitting on juries have this expectation

that there'll be, you know, carpet fiber

from some foreign place that will help them

identify the body, and if that doesn't exist,

then they're more likely to acquit.

Because there's been one study that looked at this,

and they did not find a similar CSI Effect for criminals.

It did not seem like they were learning

from these programs and getting smarter

at committing crimes.

Likely because a lot of crimes may be impulsive

and not that well planned out.

So far we are not seeing that.

Next question.

Who was America's most prolific serial killer?

America's most prolific serial killer

was named Samuel Little.

He confessed to killing over 90 people.

This is a series of mugshots of Samuel Little.

He was arrested by the police for various crimes,

but it was never put together

that he was the one murdering all of these women.

He committed murder from about 1970 until 2005.

His victims tended to be sex workers,

women addicted to drugs, women living on the streets.

And his method was he tended to strangle these women.

It wasn't until they eventually pulled

Samuel Little's DNA that they were able to go back

and connect him to all these previous crimes,

and then he confessed to all of them.

He can be connected to for sure, 50 or 60 or so of them

but they think that all 90 of his confessions are legit.

Puppet Combo asks, What kind of job

would a serial killer have?

And if we look at patterns in the data

there are some jobs that emerge as maybe overrepresented.

Things like mechanics, machinists.

You see a number of truck drivers and police officers

where it's maybe easier to get away with the crime.

The data on serial killers

is not great generally across the board

just 'cause there's so few of them and it's hard to study.

@tabzahs asks, In light of the recent case of the nurse,

are female serial killers

more likely to be in caring professions than not?

There's not that many female serial killers, but of them,

there have been quite a few nurses.

A study recently published

that looked at 16 different nurses

who had committed serial murder

across the globe and across centuries,

and they did find that it tended to be poisoning

and it tended to go undetected

for a long period of time

because of the profession that they had.

This recent case,

I believe is referring to the British nurse

who was just sentenced for killing of seven newborn babies.

Another example of a serial killer nurse is Kristen Gilbert,

who was an American nurse who was convicted

of murdering four of her patients that were in her care.

I would not extend that to other caring professions.

I don't think there's a lot of social work serial killers,

but certainly when it comes to nurses, we see it.

@PatDoc05 asked, What age do serial killers

typically start killing people?

It's actually older than other forms of violence.

When it comes to serial killing,

they start mid to late 20s,

so it tends to be a bit of a later onset.

@dlowther715 asks two questions.

Who was the Zodiac Killer

and why wasn't Ted Cruz ever caught?

There's a lot of people who have been accused

of being the Zodiac Killer over time.

Ted Cruz is not one of them.

The Zodiac Killer committed a series of murders

in Northern California in than the 1960s,

at least five that they know of.

There may have been more.

This is a composite sketch of what they think

the Zodiac Killer looked like

based on a couple of the victims who actually survived.

There was one suspect that was named.

Arthur Leigh Allen was a school teacher,

but there was never enough evidence

to actually link him to the crimes.

It was all circumstantial.

He did several years in prison for molesting children

and then died in the early '90s,

so nobody was ever convicted of these crimes.

There was a number of unique things about the Zodiac Killer.

He sent letters that he demanded be printed

in the newspaper.

He created these mathematical ciphers,

which were like these coded puzzles

that he wanted people to spend time on trying to unravel.

One was cracked about a week after it was published.

Two are still unsolved.

And one was actually only cracked a few years ago.

60 years after the crime,

a team of mathematicians cracked it.

The ciphers didn't give away his identity.

They basically just said,

I like killing.

All my victims will become my slaves in an afterlife.

It didn't give any additional clues.

He was interested in making the public

a part of these murders.

Drawing people in, forcing them to sort of play

with these codes that he was publishing.

@BigBall01790335 asks, Why do serial killers

in prison gets tons of marriage proposals from women?

This is a phenomenon.

I have worked on capital murder cases

with people facing the death penalty,

and the more media coverage the case got,

the more letters those individuals would receive.

I think women who write these letters

are romantically drawn towards this very dangerous person

who has done these scary, dangerous things.

I don't think these women

are looking to themselves to get harmed,

but they are drawn to the fact that this person

is capable of doing that level of harm.

@colleen_benn asks, Does it seem like family annihilators

are happening more often?

There was a spike of family annihilations

in 2019 where we saw record levels

and then it's come back town.

I think we hear about them

more often through media and through social media

and our exposure

so it can feel like they're happening more often.

Family annihilation is when a man kills typically his wife,

his children, and then usually himself, all in one act.

We have about 10 to 20 of those per year.

Family annihilations, unfortunately,

are always something that has happened in history.

Family annihilators are typically men.

They're a bit older, 40s, maybe 50s.

Elementary school aged children,

they tend to have a history

of domestic violence and suicidality.

They are suicides in addition to being homicides,

but they're these kind of angry suicides

where it's, I'm not just gonna kill myself.

I'm gonna make sure my wife and children

come with me so they don't get to exist without me.

So there's a level of, I think,

control that comes with committing that sort of violence.

@danablankenhorn asked,

Why did Jeffrey Dahmer eat people?

He was a serial killer who, after he had killed someone,

he would take apart their bodies, body parts were found

in the freezer in various states of decay,

and then he would actually admitted to eating their bodies.

Jeffrey Dahmer has been asked about this

on a few different occasions,

and I think there's one theory that this is really about

complete dominance and control over your victims.

You can't be more dominant over something

than to consume it.

Then there's been some recent reports lately

that said it was maybe more about actually connecting

with the victims,

that he was very lonely and consuming his victims

allowed him to kind of be a part of those victims.

@mlmarkotanova asked, If Ted Bundy were killing

in this gen, he wouldn't make it too far.

Everyone has phones that have emergency features.

Drones and satellites could track him.

Cars are traceable.

Today's forensics and DNA tracing is incredible, et cetera.

Serial killing really peaked in the '70, '80s,

and early '90s.

Then we've seen just this massive fall

where there are now very few serial killers today.

That's because of advances

in all sorts of technology, primarily DNA.

Also, we just changed our behavior.

Not a lot of people are going hitchhiking these days

and getting in cars with strangers, and if you did,

you'd certainly text someone to say you were there.

So I agree that Ted Bundy

would not get away with serial killing these days.

@metal_dad asks, Who else thinks missing hikers

isn't just a series of unfortunate accidents.

Most of those cases are people who fall

or there's accidents,

but a number of people are not recovered.

And there is actually a number of serial killers,

of murders, where it took place while somebody was hiking.

It makes me think of the Gabby Petito murder

who was killed by her fiance, Brian Laundrie

when they were out hiking.

And this makes me think about this theory of crime.

It's called Routine Activities,

and it's where you have a motivated offender,

a suitable target,

and then a lack of capable guardianship.

And so hiking is kind of your perfect example

of a total lack of guardianship.

There's nobody around for miles, there's no cameras.

Oftentime there's no cell coverage.

You can easily dispose of a body.

You can make it look like an accident.

Those were all the questions for today.

Those were some great questions.

"Tesla will release its 2023 Holiday Update next week with a few big changes, including one that lets Teslas call 911 automatically if the car’s airbags deploy in a crash. On Thursday, the company announced the update is coming next week, and it highlighted other coming features like Apple Podcasts support, rear-screen Bluetooth headset support, an updated version of the park assistance with 3D visuals, and new blind spot indicators.

Apple Podcast support joins Apple Music, which Tesla added last year. Not a Tesla App reported yesterday that Tesla owners can sync podcasts with Apple devices.

"One Democratic aide told NBC News that the party’s negotiators have offered proposals to streamline asylum processing and change the “credible fear” standard for approving an asylum claim, a measure that immigration advocates oppose. But Republicans have rejected those reasonable compromises and reportedly are pushing for extreme measures that could effectively end asylum altogether and could mean giving the executive branch broad new power to shut down the border.

There are important and still unresolved questions about what kind of immigration this country requires, and how much. This board has supported the need for more effective border security, a more rational system of screening and admitting asylum seekers and legislation that would allow a level of immigration that better reflects the needs and values of the American public. This aid package can’t address all those issues, but it could help add structure and safety to who is entering the country, when and how.

This package also should not be seen as a blanket approval of Israel’s approach to war in Gaza. There are real concerns about the number of civilian casualties in this conflict so far, and the Biden administration has been appropriately vocal about these concerns. In February, the State Department put strict rules in place to try to reduce the risk of harm to civilians from the use of American weapons. So far, there is no indication that the United States considers either Israel or Ukraine to be in violation of American policy.

Publicly, both Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have urged Israel to reduce the number of civilian casualties, and administration officials have become more forceful, in public statements and in private conversations with Israeli leaders. The recent humanitarian pause that the United States helped negotiate has saved many lives — by halting the bombardments, allowing aid to enter Gaza and allowing the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas.

The fighting in Gaza has resumed, and according to Mr. Blinken, Israel has put in place new steps to protect civilians, including keeping combat operations limited to designated areas of Gaza. Still, a “gap” remains “between the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground,” Mr. Blinken said. As the fighting continues, the Biden administration should do everything it can to make sure that if Israel continues to use American weapons, it adheres to U.S. policy.",political
"Transcript

Hi, I'm Keenan Crane.

I am a geometer and professor of computer science at

Carnegie Mellon university.

And today I've been asked to explain fractals at five levels

of increasing complexity.

So fractals are a sort of strange kind of shape that have

detail at all different levels.

Fractals appear all over nature.

They rise naturally in computer graphics because we wanna

make beautiful images of the natural world.

Fractals are also really interesting because they show how

extremely simple descriptions can give rise to really

complex shapes.

What's your name?

Myra.

Have you heard of fractals before?

No, absolutely not.

So a fractal is something that we see every day,

but it's a little bit hard to describe.

It's it's a shape that if you look at it really far away,

or you look at it really up close,

it has kind of a similar appearance.

And actually that word fractal sounds

a little bit like fraction.

Yes. Right?

So actually fractals are in some way fractions,

but for shapes.

Have you ever seen a movie called Moana?

Yes. Yeah.

Moana lives on this like beautiful island, right?

Yes.

This island has lots of trees on it.

Some artists had to make all those trees.

How do you think they do that?

They tried to find something similar to that on the Google

and they try to picture it in their heads saying,

what would, what would it look like if they,

it was animated?

So somehow they have to explain

to the computer what a tree

looks like so that the computer can draw the tree for them.

Yes.

And that's kind of what we're gonna try out today.

In fact, we're gonna have you build a fractal.

A tree is a really good example of a fractal

because if you look at the whole tree

and then you break off a big branch of the tree.

Yes.

It almost looks like that branch that you broke off is

itself another tree.

So our rule is that every branch splits

into two smaller branches.

Okay.

[low beat music]

So your tree is totally beautiful,

but it took a long time to make, right.

How would you feel if I said,

now you have to make a thousand of those trees.

I'd be like, oh my that's a lot of work.

Yeah, it's a ton of work.

If you think about Moana's island,

it has these tens and hundreds of thousands of trees on it.

And that's why we need computers to help us out

because computers are really good

at taking these really simple rules,

like put two branches on every other branch

and doing it really, really fast.

I want to know how to draw a fractal.

On a computer if you wanna learn to draw fractals,

then you might need to learn a little bit about programming.

[Keenan] Programming. Yeah.

Like coding.

Like coding, exactly.

That's what actually a lot of the artists for the movies are

working with code rather than with a paintbrush.

So in your own words,

how would you describe a fractal to somebody?

I would describe a fractal by saying

that when you see a, a object,

if you zoom in closely,

you'll see that it's, it's broken down into pieces.

So as you zoom in more closely,

you'll keep seeing smaller and smaller pieces.

Definitely that is totally what fractals are all about.

Yes.

[low beat music]

What are you studying in seventh grade these days?

I think we're doing geometry still.

What if I told you that there are shapes where you can't

measure the length of the perimeter.

It's big, but all of the sides are kind of like,

so weird

that they wouldn't be able

to pinpoint anything specific to add together.

The shape is just super, super complicated.

Yeah.

And so you can't actually measure the length.

Yeah. Right?

Yeah.

So that's already a really good idea of what a fractal is.

It has some really, really interesting detail at all,

scales that makes it hard to talk about standard quantities

like lengths and areas and volumes.

Would a planet or an asteroid be a fractal?

Yeah, so if you look at kind of the wrinkly surface

of an asteroid,

each one of those little wrinkles adds

a little bit to the surface area.

And so it's really hard to say,

what is the area of an asteroid?

Let's take a look at a little example of where fractals

actually show up in nature.

What we're gonna try to do is we're gonna try

to say what the length of the coastline of great Britain is.

So we're gonna start out with the blue ones,

which are spaced further apart.

We're gonna ask you to connect the blue pins

with a piece of string so we can get a measurement

of the coastline.

[low beat music]

So we have our first measurement

of the length of the coastline,

and we're gonna do it over again.

But this time we're gonna use the white pins,

which are spaced closer together.

[low beat music]

So we measured the coastline again.

And what do you think happens?

There's more in and out.

Therefore probably takes more string for this one.

I think I agree with you,

but I think to really validate our scientific experiment,

we should probably compare the length of the string.

[low beat music]

A lot of extra slack in that pig of string.

So what we noticed with great Britain is

we were never able to measure it's length.

It just kept getting longer and longer.

This is called the coastline paradox where there's not

really one definite number you can assign

to the length of the coastline,

but it depends on how you measure it.

Like if we kept going to really get this to be accurate,

we might have to like actually go down the beach

and start measuring these tiny little details

along the coastline.

But really there's so much detail.

We would probably never get a definite answer

for how long the coastline is.

Fractals also give us a really nice language.

We're talking about how smooth

or rough some kind of shape is.

And actually a lot of people,

engineers and scientists use this idea of fractals

and this language of fractals

to compare different shapes,

not in terms of their size, but in terms of their roughness.

So based on everything we talked about today,

how would you describe a fractal

to somebody in your own words?

It's a shape,

that you can't describe as a shape.

Yeah, totally.

Like it's a shape that you can't use sort

of the ordinary language that we use

to talk about shapes you really need

some other ideas or concepts to talk about.

[low beat music]

Do you play any video games?

I really like hard stone Minecraft.

What happens in Minecraft if you get really,

really close to a shape?

Well, it just looks like a block.

Yeah it looks really blocky.

And it's the same thing not only with shapes and games,

but also colors and textures.

And this is an especially a big problem in virtual reality

because you have no control over where people are gonna go.

What they're gonna look at,

how close they're gonna get to various objects.

So fractals on the other hand are these things that have

infinitely, you know,

nice details you get closer and closer and closer.

And so this is something that can help us solve this problem

in computer graphics of generating more detail.

One of the reasons why fractals are really nice

for computer graphics is

because the algorithms that we use to draw

images also have this kind of recursive flavor.

What's recursion?

Recursion is a function that uses itself

or calls itself in it's definition.

And basically with that,

you can figure out minute details such as searching

for a value in a binary tree.

It's kind of like iterating through itself,

but it's often more sophisticated

in that it's easier to write.

They're easy for a computer to execute, right?

It just has to run this recursive procedure over and over

and over again.

We can kind of get as much detail as we want or need.

When I think about fractals and kind of what they've done

for computer graphics.

The example I think is subdivision surfaces.

Did you, did you encounter subdivision surfaces

in your graphics class at all?

The name doesn't really ring a bell?

So subdivision surface is a way

of describing a smooth shape

on a computer rather than some complicated fractal shape.

So meshes and computer graphics are usually made of these

flat polygons with kind of sharp edges.

And so the question is how can I get something nice

and round and smooth out of these sharp looking polygons?

What I can do is I can start cutting one at a time,

the corners of this paper off, it still looks very angular.

I still have these really sharp points.

Right why are we doing this?

Because I want to draw a smooth curve on the screen,

but all my computer can do is draw straight lines.

And that's actually too true of GPUs.

It's kind of interesting.

GPUs are basically really fast machines that can only draw

one thing and that's a flat triangle.

And so if we keep doing this with our paper,

you kind of get pretty quickly the idea

of what's gonna happen.

So when you go to see a Pixar movie, for instance,

every surface has been subdivided down.

So you have tiny little triangles called micro polygons that

are even smaller than the size of a pixel.

How long does this process take?

Well, because people who really need

to use these subdivision services for everything,

people who worked hard over the years

to make this super, super fast.

In fact, subdivision services

were invented basically at Pixar.

There's this guy, Ed Capel,

and he was harshly responsible for one

of the most famous kinds of subdivision surfaces called

Capel Clark subdivision surfaces.

And in fact recently won the touring award

for these subdivision services.

What do you think are the current shortcomings in,

I guess applying fractals to computer science right now,

what are, what is the cutting edge?

So we've, talked a little bit about the positive features

of fractals and procedural graphics,

which is you can write one simple recursive program

and the computer creates a lot of detail for you.

So that's really nice, right?

It's saving you a lot of work,

but the downside is you lose a lot of control.

So because the only thing you're describing

is this short little program,

you don't have complete control

over how this is gonna end up.

And so adding more controllability to procedural graphics is

something people have been thinking about for many years.

So how has our conversation changed your understanding

of what fractals are all about?

I think it's really interesting to see the different ways,

fractals will be not only useful,

but necessary in being able to render these games

and these different programs that are interesting

in the metaverse or different media

to be really beautiful.

[low beat music]

Hey, thanks for joining us remotely.

Yeah, of course it's a pleasure I'm happy to be here.

Do you have any sense

of how you would give a really precise

mathematical definition to, you know, what is a fractal?

It would probably have to be some kind

of recursive definition, like imaginary numbers.

I know the Mandelbrot set we'll use those.

The Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, you know,

the idea is always, oh,

I'm gonna apply some polynomial over and over again.

Z squared plus C or something like that.

When I think about fractals,

I try to get away from these very specific examples and ask,

what is it fundamentally that makes a fractal, a fractal.

And one thing that I think you can be precise about,

even if you can't really say exactly what a fractal is,

is you can talk about this idea of fractal dimension.

Have you ever heard of that? No, I have not actually.

So if you look at this, this piece of paper,

what would you say the dimension is?

Well on the, on the paper itself,

I would say it's two dimensional,

but the actual paper would be three dimensions because it

has a very small thickness.

Yeah, great.

So, so the real physical paper has some amount of thickness,

but when we model this mathematically,

we might ignore the thickness and say, yeah,

this is really just kind

of a two dimensional sheet of paper.

And then you have your apple,

how many dimensions is the apple?

I would also say three.

And why three?

Because it has the pipes and the width.

And there's a depth to it as well.

Totally, now, as a little experiment,

take your piece of paper and just crumple it into a ball.

So what is it?

Is the paper three dimensional or is it two dimensional?

It changed and dimensions depending on how it is shaped.

So it's not quite as solid as the apple,

but it's also not quite as two dimensional

as the original sheet of paper.

And so for this reason, people associate this crumpled ball

with a fractal dimension,

maybe something like 2.5 dimensions instead of two or three,

there are a lot of different definitions,

precise definitions of fractal dimension.

But I think the one that's easiest to understand is this

thing called box counting dimension.

You have, let's say an image

and you want to decide what's the fractal

dimension of this image.

So what you're gonna do is you're gonna count the number

of boxes, or you can imagine big pixels

of this image that cover the

boundary of this shape.

And you're gonna see how does that counting compare

with how the counts work for just an ordinary shape?

So, so if I have a straight line

and I start out with one big

box that covers the whole line,

and now I shrink my boxes by a factor of two,

I just make boxes half as big.

How many boxes will I need to cover that line two?

And if I cut that box in half again,

how many boxes do I need to cover the line.

Four.

But if you take a more interesting shape,

some kind of fractal shape,

like let's say the coastline of great Britain

and you start doing this box, counting experiment,

something really interesting happens

as you make these boxes smaller,

the number of boxes you need to cover the coastline grows

faster than it would for just a straight line.

Yeah, I've, I've heard about that.

Where if you,

if you change the amount of measurement for a coastline,

you can actually change like how much of the coast that,

that there is like if you measure in mile lengths,

you're gonna get a much different estimate than if you

measure in one inch increments.

And so what this box counting is getting

at is saying, well, I still can never decide

what the length of the coastline is,

but what I can do is I can see how quick does the number

of boxes grow relative to how it would grow just

for an ordinary one dimensional curve,

like a line or a circle.

Is there any other interesting applications of fractals?

So procedural computer graphics,

which kind of came out of thinking

about fractals is one answer to this question

about how do you add more detail

without for instance, consuming tons of memory

or requiring artists to paint ultra

detail the textures.

So if, if you can instead describe at least some aspect

of what you're looking at in a procedural

or recursive way, then you can add

as much detail as you need

when you get close to objects.

Oh, you mean like perlin noise?

Yeah like perlin noise is a great example, right?

Perlin noise was one

of the early ways of synthesizing additional texture

at any level of detail that you needed

to make things look natural and realistic.

I have a, a random question.

Do you know how the research into fractals began?

You can look pretty far back

in history to see kind of glimmers of this idea

of fractals in science in the 19th century,

people were trying to look for examples of things

in mathematics that were very unnatural.

So there was, for instance, this guy named Georg Cantor,

who was showing that you can have these sets with really

strange properties,

or you can have functions with really strange properties.

This thing called the devil staircase and so on.

And it wasn't until about a century later where someone

named Mendel Brock said,

Oh, actually this strange mathematics that was meant

to show how unnatural things can happen

is actually a perfect description

of things that really do happen in nature.

And from there, people really ran with it and said,

Oh, okay, well,

if these fractal descriptions are good for nature,

we can also use that for creating really realistic

and believable pictures in computer graphics.

[low beat music]

I can say that when you reached out to me

and I first learned about this program,

I immediately went to my computer

and I implemented yet another version of like zooming

into the Mandelbrot set. Yeah.

Just because I was so excited, you know?

So that the thing is that it took me maybe 30 minutes.

A kid at home who's like 13

and 14 who just starts playing around

with a simple computer program can make

incredibly beautiful fractals.

Yeah for sure. And I think that's one

of the things that's exciting about it.

Or you don't even need computers.

Like I remember when I was a kid,

I played electric guitar and I had all these guitar pedals

with different effects and oh,

what happens if you put the output back in the input

and just run it through itself,

you're gonna start hearing this kind

of fractal sound, right?

So today we've been telling people,

fractals are things that are somehow self-similar,

they have detail at all scales.

Are there other ways you might introduce fractals

to somebody or are there other things you might say,

this is what a fractal is?

I think you could get to the reasons why does a coastline

look like a coastline at all different scales?

It's because the forces of nature tend

to work similarly at all different scales.

And it's those forces that are doing very,

very simple things over and over and over again

that are constantly creating the sense of detail.

I think about like the scale

and variance of different physical equations,

like navier-stokes is, you know, kind of scale

and variant, you know,

this Reynolds number that tells you how viscous things are,

but you can have the same kind of fluid behavior

at all different scales.

And that's why you get turbulence at all different scales.

Yeah I actually actually remember the moment

when I finally figured out how

to make turbulence in computer graphics,

I was working for this company,

Maggi and Disney was working on a movie.

I think it was weird science where they wanted

to have a marble vase.

And then about three in the morning,

I was at a diner nearby and I was pouring the cream

into the coffee and I was watching it

and I started watching it swirl around.

And I realized that what was happening was really simple

that you had this line of cream and then it hits the cup and

it folds and then the folds get caught up.

And then that folds again.

And it's a really simple process of folding within folding.

And I just went to the computer and did that.

Yeah.

And things look like marble and looked like flame.

And they looked like clouds and they look like

you just keep using those simple techniques.

Yeah and I think it's really cool that this kind

of fractal description of geometry

or physics is also kind of baked

into the nature of computation.

Computation is recursive kind of biased nature.

And so it's kind of a match made in heaven that we happen

to build these machines that also-

[Ken] Right.

You know, behave the way that nature does.

You just have to understand recursion.

Exactly.

So somebody once told me in order to understand recursion,

you just have to understand recursion.

There you go.

And then you get it all. Yeah.

But I think it's this point that that point

with the coffee is important

because the forces we're operating at one scale,

they're operating at the scale of the coffee cup.

But over time they kept making details

that were smaller and smaller.

Process at one scale, plus time you get fractals.

I think that's also,

what's so beautiful about fractals is that,

you know, if you think about sort

of the history of geometry as well,

Felix Klein was looking at geometry by saying,

well, geometry is all about in variance.

I have some group of transformations

and I look at objects that are sort of

in variant with respect to these transformations.

So if you just look at translations, okay,

what kinds of shapes remain the same under translations?

Will you get tiling?

You get wallpaper.

And if you start asking that same question,

what if I allow scaling in my transformations then boom,

you have fractal.

Immediately, right.

[Keenan] Come out of nowhere.

And when everybody understands scaling.

[Keenan] Right?

Scaling is a simple thing yeah.

Now you work on kind of the future of virtual reality

and augmented reality and extended reality.

But it's kind of interesting

because I think if I think

about exploring these infinite fractal landscapes

in some way,

they still feel a little bit lonely

or they feel a little bit poor

of the kind of richness that we have

in the real world.

This is where machine learning starts coming in,

because you can start saying, okay,

this is a very, very rich virtual world,

but it's informed by, you know,

my favorite mountains that I saw in Italy once.

So you can start training these fractal worlds

on things about the real world

that have particular emotional resonance for us.

People outside of computer graphics

and engineering and science

and so forth have also thought a lot about

and used fractals as a language

for talking about nature,

for characterizing shapes

and behaviors and so forth tissue

or friction, or all sorts of really important phenomena.

Do you think that computer graphics has kind

of dropped the ball in terms of saying, you know,

this is not something that's exciting anymore

to work on procedural descriptions

and we're, we're moving on from that?

Well, I mean, if you look at any Hollywood movie

or you look at any of the game worlds that people

are spending all their time in

they're highly procedural, they have to be,

and they have to make use of fractal techniques

because it's basically a way to get enormous complexity

without having to explicitly store the complexity.

And because they're able

to use these relatively simple fractal techniques

to make very complex looking natural things.

Right?

Lazy evaluation, we love being lazy in computer graphics.

Well, it's also, it's not even possible to explore,

to store an entire world in your computer.

Absolutely.

You wanna be able to sort of generate it on the fly.

I'm looking forward to things getting better.

We're not there yet.

So one of the things I guess that touches

on is this question about controllability

or the ease of, with which everybody

can create these worlds.

Not just people, not just mathematicians, not just,

you know, trained computer scientists.

One thing when I think about Ken Musgraves working

about this program, Bryce,

this one I felt like I could really use,

what do you think we still need to do

in terms of putting these kinds of tools in,

in people's hands, making it easier

for people to use procedural machine learning,

to build these kind of worlds?

I think in that case, it came down

to the fact that Ken in particular had a mission

to make accessible tools for people

without sacrificing the power

and the richness of making beautiful things.

I mean, in a sense he was kind

of the computer graphic, Bob Ross.

You know? So- He made a lot

of happy little trees.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Which, I mean, when you,

when you think about the techniques

of somebody like a Bob Ross they're fractal.

Yeah. And I think this is what what's so beautiful also

about Mandelbrot's work is him saying, you know,

it's not really about these exotic examples.

Like even the Mandelbrot set or Julia sets or whatever.

Yeah they're like really

interesting mathematical curiosities,

but they get at this idea that fractals are kind

of inevitable.

And Bob Ross probably never, as far as I know,

never sat down and you know,

thought about recursive descriptions

of trees or anything like that.

But it's just something that naturally comes

to you as an artist.

Well, I mean, you can go back to all the classic artists

da Vinci's notebooks were just full of like,

this thing looks like that thing

at completely different scales.

So he didn't have a fancy word for it,

but he completely understood it.

Yeah it's really part of human nature

or human's connection to nature.

Yeah. Yeah.

Hopefully our discussion today has helped you see the world

in a different way and also see how mathematics

and art can come together to make beautiful images.

I hope it's inspired you to look at the world

around you in a different way.",technology
"You don’t need to know how to code to create your own AI chatbot. Since the start of November—shortly before the chaos at the company unfolded—OpenAI has let anyone build and publish their own custom versions of ChatGPT, known as “GPTs”. Thousands have been created: A “nomad” GPT gives advice about working and living remotely, another claims to search 200 million academic papers to answer your questions, and yet another will turn you into a Pixar character.

However, these custom GPTs can also be forced into leaking their secrets. Security researchers and technologists probing the custom chatbots have made them spill the initial instructions they were given when they were created, and have also discovered and downloaded the files used to customize the chatbots. People’s personal information or proprietary data can be put at risk, experts say.

“The privacy concerns of file leakage should be taken seriously,” says Jiahao Yu, a computer science researcher at Northwestern University. “Even if they do not contain sensitive information, they may contain some knowledge that the designer does not want to share with others, and [that serves] as the core part of the custom GPT.”

Along with other researchers at Northwestern, Yu has tested more than 200 custom GPTs, and found it “surprisingly straightforward” to reveal information from them. “Our success rate was 100 percent for file leakage and 97 percent for system prompt extraction, achievable with simple prompts that don’t require specialized knowledge in prompt engineering or red-teaming,” Yu says.

Custom GPTs are, by their very design, easy to make. People with an OpenAI subscription are able to create the GPTs, which are also known as AI agents. OpenAI says the GPTs can be built for personal use or published to the web. The company plans for developers to eventually be able to earn money depending on how many people use the GPTs.

To create a custom GPT, all you need to do is message ChatGPT and say what you want the custom bot to do. You need to give it instructions about what the bot should or should not do. A bot that can answer questions about US tax laws may be given instructions not to answer unrelated questions or answers about other countries’ laws, for example. You can upload documents with specific information to give the chatbot greater expertise, such as feeding the US tax-bot files about how the law works. Connecting third-party APIs to a custom GPT can also help increase the data it is able to access and the kind of tasks it can complete.",technology
"The Washington Post Exclusive OpenAI leaders warned of abusive behavior before Sam Altman’s ouster The senior employees described Altman as psychologically abusive, creating chaos at the artificial-intelligence start-up — complaints that were a major factor in the board’s abrupt decision to fire the CEO (Illustration by Elena Lacey/The Washington Post; TWP; iStock)

This fall, a small number of senior leaders approached the board of OpenAI with concerns about chief executive Sam Altman. Altman — a revered mentor, prodigious start-up investor and avatar of the AI revolution — had been psychologically abusive, the employees alleged, creating pockets of chaos and delays at the artificial-intelligence start-up, according to two people familiar with the board’s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. The company leaders, a group that included key figures and people who manage large teams, mentioned Altman’s allegedly pitting employees against each other in unhealthy ways, the people said.

Although the board members didn’t use the language of abuse to describe Altman’s behavior, these complaints echoed some of their interactions with Altman over the years, and they had already been debating the board’s ability to hold the CEO accountable. Several board members thought Altman had lied to them, for example, as part of a campaign to remove board member Helen Toner after she published a paper criticizing OpenAI, the people said.

The new complaints triggered a review of Altman’s conduct during which the board weighed the devotion Altman had cultivated among factions of the company against the risk that OpenAI could lose key leaders who found interacting with him highly toxic. They also considered reports from several employees who said they feared retaliation from Altman: One told the board that Altman was hostile after the employee shared critical feedback with the CEO and that he undermined the employee on that person’s team, the people said.

“It is clear that there were real misunderstandings between me and members of the board,” Altman wrote on X. “For my part, it is incredibly important to learn from this experience and apply those learnings as we move forward as a company.”

The complaints about Altman’s alleged behavior, which have not previously been reported, were a major factor in the board’s abrupt decision to fire Altman on Nov. 17, according to the people. Initially cast as a clash over the safe development of artificial intelligence, Altman’s firing was at least partially motivated by the sense that his behavior would make it impossible for the board to oversee the CEO.

Altman was reinstated as CEO five days later, after employees released a letter signed by a large percentage of OpenAI’s 800-person staff, including most senior managers, and threatening mass resignations.

“We believe Sam is the best leader for OpenAI,” said company spokesperson Hannah Wong. “The senior leadership team was unanimous in asking for Sam’s return as CEO and for the board’s resignation, actions backed by an open letter signed by over 95% of our employees.”

Anna Makanju, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, who signed the letter, echoed the sentiment in a statement shared by the company: “In my experience working closely with Sam, he brings passion to the work and to the mission. While he has strong opinions, he values my team’s counsel, listens to diverse perspectives, and consistently encourages open and honest discussions.”

Now back at the helm of OpenAI, Altman may find that the company is less united than the waves of heart emojis that greeted his return on social media might suggest.

Some employees said Altman’s camp began undermining the board’s decision shortly after he was removed as CEO, the people said. Within hours, messages dismissed the board as illegitimate and decried Altman’s firing as a coup by OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, according to the people.

On social media, in news reports and on the anonymous app Blind, which requires members to sign up with a work email address to post, people identified as current OpenAI employees also described facing intense peer pressure to sign the mass-resignation letter.

Some OpenAI employees have rejected the idea that there was any coercion to sign the letter. “Half the company had signed between the hours of 2 and 3am,” a member of OpenAI’s technical staff, who tweets under the pseudonym roon, posted on X. “That’s not something that can be accomplished by peer pressure.”

Joanne Jang, who works in products at OpenAI, tweeted that no influence had been at play. “The google doc broke so people texted each other at 2-2:30 am begging people with write access to type their name.”

For longtime employees, there was added incentive to sign: Altman’s departure jeopardized an investment deal that would allow them to sell their stock back to OpenAI, cashing out equity without waiting for the company to go public. The deal — led by Joshua Kushner’s Thrive Capital — values the company at almost $90 billion, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, more than triple its $28 billion valuation in April, and it could have been threatened by tanking value triggered by the CEO’s departure.

Members of the board expected employees to be upset about Altman’s firing, but they were taken aback when OpenAI’s management team appeared united in their support for bringing him back, said the people, as well as a third person with knowledge of the board’s proceedings, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive company matters.

As the company seeks to rebuild the board and smooth things over with Microsoft, its key partner, it has committed to launching an internal investigation into the debacle, which broke into public view on the Friday before Thanksgiving.

In a post on the company blog, the board wrote that Altman had been removed as CEO after a review found that he had not been “consistently candid in his communications.” The Washington Post previously reported that the board’s vote was triggered by a pattern of manipulation and rooted in Altman’s attempts to avoid checks on his power at OpenAI.

Altman himself helped pioneer OpenAI’s unique board structure, according to a person familiar with the board proceedings at the time. The group has had as many as nine members and is supposed to contain a majority of members with no financial stake in OpenAI. At the time of Altman’s firing, it was down to six members: three employees (president and co-founder Greg Brockman, Altman, and Sutskever) and three independent directors (Toner, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley and Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo).

But the lack of concrete details around the board’s motivations allowed room for speculation and spin to take hold. Some talk focused on Sutskever, who in July was named co-lead of a new AI safety team called “Superalignment,” whose goal is to make sure advanced AI systems follow human intent. His public comments about the potential dangers of “artificial general intelligence” set the stage for a narrative about the risks of commercial interests.

The pressure on Sutskever to reverse his vote was particularly intense. Less than three days later, he wrote on X that “I deeply regret” participating in the board’s decision. He also added his name to the employee resignation letter and vowed to reunite the company.

Altman seemed to approve, quoting Sutskever’s message on X along with a trio of red heart emojis.

Sutskever’s future at OpenAI is now uncertain. “We hope to continue our working relationship and are discussing how [Sutskever] can continue his work at OpenAI,” Altman wrote in a staff-wide email after returning as CEO.

“There have been a lot of wild and inaccurate reports about what happened with the Board but the bottom line is that Ilya has very publicly stated that Sam is the right person to lead OpenAI and he is thrilled that he is back at the helm,” Sutskever’s lawyer, Alex Weingarten, chair of the litigation practice at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, wrote in a statement.

On Wednesday morning, Sutskever shared a cryptic post on X about learning many lessons in the past month. “One such lesson is that the phrase ‘the beatings will continue until morale improves’ applies more often than it has any right to,” he wrote. The tweet was quickly deleted.

"Tags — basically hashtags with a twist — are now rolling out globally on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced on Thursday.

Tags work a little differently than hashtags do on platforms like Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). When composing a Threads post, you start a tag by tapping the # symbol and then typing out your topic. But instead of being limited to just one word, you can type out a whole phrase (with spaces!) and add special characters, according to Mosseri. However, you can only make one tag per post.

The purpose of tags on Threads is the same as a hashtag, though. “If you share on Threads, [tags are] a great way to help connect with people who are interested in the topics you’re talking about,” Mosseri says. “And for everyone, it’s a great way to help dive deeper into your interests.”

I like Meta’s implementation here, even the single-tag limit, as it seems like a smart way to prevent annoying hashtag spam. That said, we’ll have to wait and see if users actually adopt the tags so that they can become a useful way to find conversations about a topic. (I’m hoping there will be some tags about The Game Awards when I cover that event tonight.)",technology
"Pardo faults the Israeli PM for giving the false impression that the country's very existence was at stake | Yahel Gazit/AFP via Getty Images

Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.

TEL AVIV — “Benjamin Netanyahu is not a brave leader,” says Tamir Pardo, a former director of the Mossad intelligence agency. “To make hard decisions for war or for peace, you have to be brave, and he isn’t, and he panics.”

That’s how Pardo views his former boss’ reaction to October 7 — as fitting a pattern of behavior he observed first-hand from 2011 to 2016, when Pardo led Israel’s vaunted external intelligence agency.

In the days after October 7, “Netanyahu was in a state of panic and heightened alarm by comparing the Hamas attack, however bestial, to the Holocaust,” Pardo says. He faults the Israeli PM for giving the false impression that the country’s very existence was at stake, when in fact it was not.

Pardo also blames U.S. President Joe Biden for fueling apprehensions that Israel was facing an existential crisis. Biden did so, the former spy boss claims, by dispatching aircraft carriers to the region, and by telling American Jewish leaders that “no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe” if there was no Jewish state.

That remark was poorly timed, Pardo tells me during an interview in his office in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. “I think Bibi told Biden that Israel was at risk of annihilation,” he says. “But Israel has the best army in the Middle East.”

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last month that the aircraft carriers had been deployed “to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war.” But Pardo isn’t persuaded that Hezbollah plans to launch an all-out war on Israel. “If they were going to do so, they would have done [it] when Hamas attacked” and before Israel reinforced the northern border, he tells me. “They missed their opportunity.”

Israel’s endgame

All the talk about another Holocaust did two things. First, it helped Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, achieve one of his main goals: delivering a “shock-and-awe” blow that would shake Israel to its core. “Sinwar wanted to terrify Israelis, so they no longer would feel safe in their own country,” Pardo says.

The Holocaust comparisons also meant that Israel rushed into action without first devising a day-after strategy. Pardo is emphatic that Israel’s existence was never at risk on October 7, and that however gruesome the assault, it shouldn’t be compared to the Holocaust, in which an estimated six million European Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis.

Instead, he says, the Holocaust comparison has clouded hard strategic thinking about the military campaign and its day-after end goal, something that has troubled the Biden administration from the start.

More than a month after the Hamas attacks on kibbutzim in southern Israel, Pardo is still analyzing October 7 and drawing conclusions. He worries about what is to come and what Israel’s endgame will be.

He doesn’t making light of the Hamas attack, however — the barbarity troubles him deeply. One of the most disconcerting conclusions he has drawn is that the estimated 3,000 attackers would have been groomed to be as vicious as possible.

“Hamas leaders chose them and prepared them psychologically and indoctrinated them to dehumanize Jews and it would have been done over many months,” he says. Perhaps the same length of time, in other words, as it took to pull together the operational plan, gather the intelligence and stockpile the equipment — as much as two years.

Pardo’s thinking is echoed by what Israeli Military Intelligence interrogators have been told by captured Hamas gunmen — that their leaders emphasized indoctrination, with religious leaders lecturing the attackers to inflict maximum pain and extreme suffering on the Jews they encountered.

‘We don’t understand it yet’

Since he was 18 years of age, Pardo, whose parents emigrated to Israel from Turkey and Serbia, has been battling Israel’s enemies, either as an elite soldier or as a Mossad officer.

As a member of the Sayeret Matkal elite commando unit, he participated in the Entebbe raid, serving under Yoni Netanyahu, the current PM’s elder brother, who was killed on the mission. Pardo was Mossad’s senior adviser to the Israel Defense Forces during the 2006 Lebanon War, eventually rising to become the agency’s director in 2011.

He has spent most of his professional life studying Israel’s foes, trying to understand how they think and to anticipate their moves.

Like others in Israel’s defense establishment, he has trawled through what happened on October 7 to better grasp what went so terribly wrong. He seems preoccupied with Hamas’ “turning of men into monsters.”

“We don’t understand it yet and we’ll have to understand it,” he continues. “There were just a handful of incidences when the attackers stayed their hand. They were 99 percent successful in grooming them.”

Hamas had free rein when it came to recruitment, Pardo notes. Like many others in the defense establishment, he frets that Israeli leaders thought they could stick Gaza in a bottle, and turn their backs on serious negotiations with the PLO-led Palestinian Authority to achieve a political resolution.

He also highlights the tactical missteps that Israel’s military and intelligence services made in failing to pick up the signs of an attack — the consequences of misreading Hamas, of an over-reliance on high-tech electronic surveillance, and of a shift in military and intelligence focus to the West Bank to combat agitation over Israeli settlements there.

“We underestimated them — they are from an operational point of view quick learners,” he says. “I have been warning about that for years. There’s something completely stupid in Israel thinking you can deter terrorist groups. There’s no deterrence. You can eliminate them or you can give them such a fierce blow that they understand they have to turn away from terror towards politics.”",political
"December 7, 2023

In the spirit of collaboration, Tender Claws and the Communication Workers of America Local 9003 are proud to have reached a tentative collective bargaining agreement for the Tender Claws Human Union - one of the first union contracts for video game developers in the US. Tender Claws management granted the union voluntary recognition on July 22, 2022, and the parties have been in bargaining since February 2023. We are proud to be signing a fair, highly innovative agreement that solidifies our shared values and dedication to each other.

In a first for CWA 9003, both parties agreed to use an “open bargaining model” where all workers of the bargaining unit were able to attend meetings and draft contract language. The result was a highly engaged bargaining process and a democratic contract which addresses the needs and concerns of all workers.



The contract includes 50 articles across over 60 pages. Among these proposals, we are most proud of:

Clearly defined pay scales based on seniority and job title, and a formal structure for career progression, along with immediate wage increases weighted towards reducing pay gaps between positions.

Codifying LGBTQIA+ inclusive benefits including lived name and pronoun policy and expanding legal notions of the family to include chosen family for family care leave.





New benefits including dental insurance, a vision care stipend, a 401k plan, life insurance, and an education stipend for all union members.

Codifying articles specific to the games industry including a company equipment policy, repetitive stress injury protection, and virtual reality breaks.

“With our roots as a collaborative art studio, Tender Claws has always been committed to creating an inclusive and supportive workplace. We see this agreement as another step in fostering a positive work environment. We look forward to continuing to produce innovative projects together,” commented Danny Cannizzaro and Samantha Gorman, Tender Claws Co-Founders.

“We are so incredibly proud to have reached the end of this process,” said Robin LoBuglio, a game developer at Tender Claws. “Tender Claws workers have always taken care of each other.. I am deeply grateful for my many amazing colleagues who worked hard to make this historic contract happen.”

This agreement represents our continued commitment to the collaborative, diverse, and flexible work environment envisioned at Tender Claws.",technology
"Republicans are also looking to restrict the administration’s parole authority to release migrants from detention, and would require mandatory electronic monitoring for anyone, including children, who are not detained. They are also trying to implement a so-called transit ban and establish nationwide, expedited removal authority — a return to a Trump-era policy that the Biden administration rescinded in 2021.

While the GOP’s counteroffer helped jump-start talks after a failed Senate vote this week, the inclusion of policies already rejected by Democrats raises questions about whether a bipartisan proposal could come together before Congress breaks for the year. At a minimum, it showcases how much daylight remains in cutting a border deal that can unlock billions in funding for Ukraine and Israel.

An aide to Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the top Republican negotiator, said there is “no final draft.”

“Lankford has been clear that they have been exchanging paper for weeks,” the aide said.

Lankford and Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) met Thursday before breaking for the weekend, agreeing to resume negotiations that have proved incredibly difficult to finalize. Even if they were to agree on policy changes in the abstract, they would still have to formalize those into actual legislative language. And it remains unclear whether anything the Senate passes could find the necessary support in the House.

Pressure is not just coming from Republicans either. Most of the items proposed by the GOP are opposed by progressives and immigration advocates, and Murphy has complained that Republicans are pushing a total shutdown of the border in previous offers.

“We’re still swapping paper like we have been,” said Lankford on Thursday afternoon, after meeting with Murphy. “It’s not just parole, it’s how do you handle thousands of people being released every day?”

Spokespeople for the other negotiating senators did not comment.",political
"A bitter battle is taking place between Big Tech and the free press over how to share in the income that news content generates for technology giants. The future of our news ecosystem, a linchpin of democracy, depends on the outcome.

Last week, after months of hardball negotiations, Google and the Canadian government agreed on a deal that would require the company to pay Canadian news outlets about $73.5 million a year. Canadians are no longer facing the threat that Google would remove all news content from its search results.

The settlement is far less than Canada wanted — it had sought $126 million — and a small fraction of the estimated $550 million that news publishers deserve from Google. The lesson here is clear: As much as publishers may be suffering right now, they must continue to stand firm against the bullying tactics of Big Tech.

These platforms gained their audience in part by sharing news content free. Now they are using their market power to force the press to continue to do business on their terms.",political

"Lemur Pro is not the best for graphics-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing (see below for some more powerful rigs with dedicated graphics cards), but for everything else, this is one of the nicest laptops you can get.

Best for the Minimalist

Dell's XPS 13 Developer Edition was one of the first big-name laptops to ship with Linux and it remains the lightest, smallest laptop with Linux installed. This configuration sports a 12th-Generation Intel i7-1250U processor, 32 GB of RAM (soldered), and a 1-TB SSD. It ships with Ubuntu Linux 20.04, but in my testing, it will happily run any distro from Fedora to Arch (Dell support applies only to Ubuntu though). When you're on the product page, make sure you choose Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS as your operating system (it defaults to Windows).

For more details on the hardware, see our review of the Windows version (6/10 WIRED Review). While performance was not great with Windows, I have not found the same to be true using Ubuntu. The main drawback to this machine is the lack of ports. There are two USB-C ports, one of which is your charging port. There isn't even a headphone jack.

Best for the Maximalist

If the Dell's lack of ports leaves you wanting, this is the laptop for you. System76's Pangolin (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 15-inch, AMD-powered monster of a laptop with every port a sysadmin could hope for. This config ships with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U, 32 GB of RAM (soldered), and a 250-GB SSD. You can configure the Pangolin with up to 8 TB of storage.

The battery life is good for the size—it lasts all day in most use cases—but it's not as good as the Dell. The keyboard, on the other hand, is fantastic and a real pleasure to type on. The one downside is the number pad, which makes the trackpad off-center. The port selection is where the Pangolin really shines. There's Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI 2.0, a single USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port (with DisplayPort support, but not Thunderbolt), three USB-A ports, a 3.5-mm headphone/microphone combo jack, and a full-size SD card reader.

Most Repairable and Future-Proof

If you want a laptop you can upgrade, Framework's Laptop is the best Linux rig for you. There are a few flavors available. I tested the second release of the 13-inch model (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and loved it. The Intel Core 13th-Gen series chips with 32 GB of RAM, a 2-TB SSD, and whichever mix of ports suits your needs start for around $1,400. That will ship with no operating system. When it arrives you can install Linux yourself (or opt to ship it with Windows if you need to dual boot). I haven't had a chance to test it yet, but an AMD version is also available. Framework is also taking pre-orders for a new 16-inch model. The 16-inch model is available with an AMD Ryzen 7040 Series processor.

I tested Ubuntu, which Framework supports, and Arch Linux, and both worked great (though Framework does not officially support Arch). My only gripe about using the Framework is my gripe about almost any Linux laptop: battery life could be better.

Best Dedicated Graphics

The System76 Oryx Pro comes in either 15-inch or 17-inch models with 12th-Gen Intel processors and Nvidia graphics (either the 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti GPU). There are options for a glossy, OLED 4K screen, up to 64 GB of RAM, and up to 8 TB of SSD space. It's not cheap, but the Oryx Pro is by far the most powerful laptop on this page. Like the Pangolin above, the Oryx ships with either System76's Pop_OS! or Ubuntu Linux. Unlike the Pangolin, the Intel chip in the Oryx Pro means it ships with Coreboot, and open source firmware.

Best for Hackers

OK, it's corny, but there's something about the Lenovo X1 Carbon Linux edition that makes me want to install Kali Linux and start probing the coffee shop Wi-Fi. Whatever the case, this is a slick laptop for those of us who think ThinkPads are, ahem, slick. That slickness comes at a serious price though. For almost double the price of our other picks, you get a 13th-Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and a 256-GB SSD (much of this is customizable).

On the plus side, you do get a nice 2K (2,880 x 1,800), OLED, anti-glare screen. I have not had a chance to test this latest model, but I really like the previous release (8/10, WIRED Recommends,) and the new version is primarily a spec bump. It's frequently on sale for around $1,700.

If Your Budget Is Tight

One of the beauties of Linux is that it requires fewer resources and maintains support for older hardware far longer than Windows or macOS. That means you don't need to spend a fortune on a new laptop; you can breathe life into an old one or grab a used laptop off eBay. I have been doing this for years, working my way through Lenovo's X-series laptops (starting with an X220, now an T14 Gen 1), but old Dell and Asus laptops are also great for Linux.

"Slowly but surely, Apple TV+ is finding its feet. The streaming service, which at launch we called “odd, angsty, and horny as hell,” has evolved into a diverse library of dramas, documentaries, and comedies. It’s also fairly cheap compared to services like Netflix—and Apple often throws in three free months when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV.

Curious but don’t know where to get started? Below are our picks for the best shows on the service. (Also, here are our picks for the best movies on Apple TV+.) When you’re done, head over to our guides to the best shows on Netflix, best movies on Hulu, and best movies on Amazon Prime, because you can never have too much television.

Hijack

There’s this face Idris Elba does. He’s been perfecting it since he was Stringer Bell on The Wire. It’s the look of total calm even when he’s talking about the most harrowing thing you can imagine. That face gets a full workout in Hijack, in which Elba plays a corporate negotiator who finds himself trying to settle things with a group of, yes, hijackers who have taken over the flight he’s boarded to get home to his family. This series is seven episodes, roughly seven hours—the same length of the flight, and it follows the drama in the air and the political maneuvering below before attempting to stick the landing. Do stay around until the end.

For All Mankind

Long before Foundation, there was For All Mankind. The show not only set the tone for the kind of glossy prestige sci-fi Apple TV+ had ambitions to make, but it was also the streaming service's attempt to plant its flag in the realm of streaming giants. A solid slice of alternate history, the show starts with a very smart premise: What if the US was edged out in putting a man on the moon? How would the space-race rivalry between the Americans and the Soviets have played out? It's mostly a slick, stylish, NASA-heavy period drama but, as this is from the brain of Ronald D. Moore, there are a few standout moments and episodes with attention shared around the large ensemble cast. It might be the best sci-fi show you're not watching, and if that's true you now have four seasons to catch up on.

Messi Meets America

If your home screen hasn't made it obvious, Apple TV+ is super stoked about soccer these days. The streamer's latest foray: Messi Meets America, a six-part docuseries about all-star player Lionel Messi's move to Major League Soccer's Inter Miami club. The first three episodes air October 11, and subsequent episodes air in conjunction with this year's MLS season. Messi Mania, indeed.

Lessons in Chemistry

Based on the debut novel from science writer Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry is the story of Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson), who gets hired to host a cooking show after she's fired from the lab she was working in for doing science while female. Obviously, the show Elizabeth puts on ends up being about a lot more than just having dinner on the table at 6 pm, but we suggest you watch to find out just how revolutionary it is.

The Morning Show

Every streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV+ has The Morning Show. When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog. In its second season, it went deep on Covid-19, and in the third season the series' fictional network, UBA, finds itself dealing with the aftermath of a cyberattack. With that new season launching September 13, now is a good time to dive back in—or watch for the first time.

Shining Girls

This Elisabeth Moss psychological thriller/murder mystery came out last year and never really got the buzz it likely deserved. All of that to say, you should probably watch it if you haven't already. Moss plays Kirby, a woman who believes a recent Chicago murder may be linked to an attack on her many years prior. She teams with a Sun-Times reporter to investigate, but the deeper she digs the more her own reality starts to shift. Based on the book The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes, this series may seem like just another murder mystery but its sci-fi twists put it one step ahead.

Foundation

WIRED called Foundation a “flawed masterpiece” in our review of the first season. Considering the complexities of adapting a sprawling Isaac Asimov book series, it was high praise. Now, the dizzyingly ambitious Foundation is back for its second season. Starring Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, a math professor who, along with his loyal followers, is exiled for predicting the oncoming end of the galactic empire that rules over them, the show often suffers under the weight of its own massive scope. But it also features wonderful performances from Lee Pace and beautiful images inspired by the James Webb Space Telescope. If you have a soft spot for big sci-fi dramas, this Game-of-Thrones-in-space wannabe is a must-watch.

The Crowded Room

Set in the late 1970s, The Crowded Room stars Tom Holland as Danny Sullivan, a young man arrested after a grisly shooting in New York City. Following his arrest, this 10-episode limited series unfolds into a twisty whodunit as interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) tries to suss out what happened with the shooting and the peculiar events in Sullivan’s past that may have shaped how he ended up involved. Holland recently told Extra that the shoot for The Crowded Room, which he also produced, “did break me,” leading to him taking a year-long hiatus from acting. Want to see why? Watch now.

Silo

As WIRED's Kate Knibbs noted in the wake of Silo's release, this show is prestige sci-fi gold. Based on a dystopian book trilogy by Hugh Howey, the series focuses on a subterranean bunker—the silo of the title—where humanity has sequestered itself after the apocalypse. Some are hoping to win the chance to reproduce, some are trying to solve mysterious murders. Everyone watching is enjoying figuring out what's going on in this underground city—and what's happening outside of it.

Ted Lasso

On paper, Ted Lasso sounds terrible. The inconceivable story of an American football coach who has never watched a game of soccer somehow landing himself a job as coach of a (fictional) Premier League club and trying to make up for his total lack of qualifications by being a nice guy. Sounds unwatchable, doesn’t it? And yet Ted Lasso has captured the hearts and minds of viewers on both sides of the pond with its large-as-life cast and irresistibly wholesome messaging, hoovering up awards in the process. The third and final season wraps up on May 31, so now is the perfect time to binge it all.

High Desert

The Patricia Arquette-aissance doesn’t get as much ink as Matthew McConaughey or Keanu Reeves did during their second comings, but it’s here—in part thanks to the rise of streaming. Between The Act and Severance, Arquette has received some of the highest accolades of her long career recently, and High Desert seems poised to keep the award nominations coming. While coming to terms with the death of her mother, Peggy (Arquette)—an addict—decides she wants to pick up the pieces of her life and become a private investigator. She finds an unwitting employer/sometime mentor in Bruce Harvey (Brad Garrett), but not everyone is onboard with Peggy’s career decisions—namely, her straitlaced sister (Christine Taylor). It’s an odd duck of a show, which is perfectly suited to Arquette’s ethereal acting style, allowing her to seamlessly flit between moments of tragedy and laugh-out-loud comedy, with the audiences doing their best to keep up. The all-star cast is made even more impressive by recurring appearances from Bernadette Peters, as Peggy’s late mom.

Big Beasts

Look, Discovery doesn't get to corner the market on animal documentaries—and this 10-part docuseries proves it. Featuring elephant seals, brown bears, orangutans, giant otters, and all kinds of massive mammals in between, it's the perfect thing if you just want to escape and learn a few tidbits about nature. But the best part? It's narrated by Tom Hiddleston, and there's just something charming about hearing the voice of Loki talk about a bunch of different animals he could turn himself into in the blink of an eye.

The Big Door Prize

Continuing the “big” theme, The Big Door Prize, in which Chris O'Dowd plays a 40-year-old high school teacher named Dusty who's pretty content with his life until a magic machine shows up in his small town. The machine, you see, tells people their life's potential, and as soon as people around him start using it, everything changes. Marriages end, paths divert, and eventually Dusty must confront whether he's happy in his own life.

Shrinking

Do you enjoy In Treatment but wish it was, you know, fun? Then Shrinking may be right for you. Created by Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein—of Ted Lasso fame—and Jason Segel, the show is about Jimmy (Segel), a therapist struggling to get over the death of his wife and reconnect with his daughter and patients. That may sound like a downer, and the show isn’t without its harder moments, but it’s buoyed by the fact that it’s also a workplace comedy focusing on the therapy practice where Jimmy works alongside Harrison Ford’s Paul and Jessica Williams’ Gaby. Shrinking, ultimately, is about the things people do to cope, but it also features a dream team of a cast and one very memorable party scene featuring an (unrelated) vomit-soaked piano and a super-stoned Ford.

Servant

Cinematically, M. Night Shyamalan can be a little hit-or-miss, but Servant, which the filmmaker executive produces, and occasionally directs, is stellar. It's about a Philadelphia couple—a chef and a news anchor—who lose a child only to have it mysteriously come back to life (maybe) with the arrival of their new nanny. (You really just need to watch the show for any of this to make sense.) Moody, freaky, and occasionally even funny, it'll suck you in. And now that it recently wrapped its fourth and final season, there’s plenty to enjoy.

The Essex Serpent

Claire Danes doing her best trembling-chin acting in period garb; Tom Hiddleston as a town vicar; rumors about a mysterious mythological serpent—is there anything not to love about this show? No, there’s not. The Essex Serpent, based on the novel by Sarah Perry, follows a recent widow (Danes) as she heads to the countryside in Essex to investigate a “sea dragon.” There, she meets a vicar, Will (Hiddleston), who is far more skeptical of the serpent’s existence. Lush and inviting, it’s the ideal period mystery.

Severance

Out of all the shows on this list, Severance may be the one that firmly established Apple TV+ as a streaming player with edgy prestige content. Adam Scott plays Mark, a man distraught by the death of his wife who opts to undergo Severance, a procedure that divides his memories of work from those of his life at home. He’s quite happy with the setup until a former Lumon Industries coworker tracks him down when he’s out-of-office, setting off a series of events that makes him question not only Severance but the work his company does. From there, it only gets more weird and bleak with each passing minute. Tense and heartbreaking, this show, the bulk of which was directed by Ben Stiller, will keep you guessing, and questioning, the whole way through.

Little America

Originally released when Donald Trump was still president of the United States, Little America was and remains a timely reminder of what actually makes America great. Each episode of this anthology series focuses on a different story of immigrants living in America. From an undocumented high school student who discovers a talent for squash to a “bra whisperer” in Brooklyn, every one of these 30-minute vignettes—all of them based on real people—is inspiring and important viewing.

Mythic Quest

An all-too-rare example of a video game TV show that really works, Mythic Quest is one of the best new workplace comedies of the last few years. Presented in perfectly bingeable half-hour episodes, the show follows a fictional game studio known for its World of Warcraft–like MMO, Mythic Quest, as the people who make it slalom through their many quirky relationships. The writing is excellent, consistently funny and emotionally impactful when you least expect it, and the show manages to confront real issues in the industry without sacrificing laughs.

Dickinson

Hailee Steinfeld is a riotous young Emily Dickinson in this half-hour show from creator Alena Smith. It was part of the original Apple TV+ lineup and quickly distinguished itself thanks to its off-kilter vision of 19th century Amherst, Massachusetts. The first season is a set of sharp, surreal vignettes, inspired by Dickinson's work and tracing the imagined life of the young poet, who is rebelling against her father, the town's societal rules, and just about everything else. The second and third seasons go deeper—examining not only the poet's life, but also the roles race, gender, sexuality, and class played in the early days of America. If you're a Dickinson stan, love a bit of smart queer dramedy, or just have a penchant for a modern soundtrack in a Civil War–era show, you’ll dig this.",technology
"My mission to 100 percent Super Mario Bros. Wonder officially started a couple of weeks ago, but really it began in the late ‘80s.

As a kid, I was certifiably bad at Mario. We didn’t have our own Nintendo console, so any time I spent playing Mario prior to that was at a friend’s or cousin’s house. I’d hold the second controller and wait my turn, marveling at how they just knew where the hidden boxes were, where to jump to the top of the screen and skip ahead three levels, and how to get to the very top of the flagpole every single time. As I struggled to clear the first few stages before running out of lives, it seemed obvious to me that I lacked some instinct that made my friends good at Mario and made me objectively terrible.

A few decades later, I found myself once again sitting on the couch in my pajamas playing a side-scrolling Mario game. And as I cruised through Mario Wonder’s delightful levels, I decided I would 100 percent the game after beating it. Why? Honestly, I’m not sure. Maybe partly because the game is so charming and I didn’t want to be done playing it yet. But I think at least part of the reason was to prove to myself that all these years later, maybe I am good at Mario. And what could be more definitive proof than collecting every seed, purple ten coin, and flagpole in the game?

The Final-Final Test Badge Marathon is a gauntlet of the worst, trickiest ‘Mario’ shit you can imagine

Picking up the extras that I’d missed the first time around started off easy — delightful, even. Mario Wonder is pretty forgiving, which helped. If you pick up a purple coin and die in a lava pit later in the level, you don’t have to go collect the coin again. That’s key because they’re often in tricky spots, and if the game required you to finish the level on one life to retain the coin, I think I would have thrown my Switch into the sea. Even the trickier stages in the Special World and timed KO challenges were difficult but still fun in a way. Then I arrived at the very last stage, which is only revealed after you reach 100 percent on every level in the game. That’s when things changed.

The Final-Final Test Badge Marathon is a gauntlet of the worst, trickiest Mario shit you can imagine. There are 10 mini-stages inside this absolute monster, and it is the most infuriating level of any video game I’ve played in my life. Each level requires you to use a different badge ability and is specially tailored to drive you out of your mind as you time seemingly impossible jumps and dodge seemingly impossible obstacles. You do it over and over until you finally figure out your way through the level, and then you have to learn another new mini-level with fresh horrors. There are only two (!) checkpoints in the whole thing, so you end up repeating some of the same levels over and over and over until you’ve mastered the ones after it.

You have to bounce on these weird fish balloons while invisible to get through the final stage. Image: Nintendo

Cumulatively, I went through hours of play and hundreds of lives over the course of a week after tucking my kid into bed to slowly master the final-final test’s challenges. I only started to reach the very last stage three days in. I confessed to Verge’s games Slack channel that I was attempting to clear the last level, and my colleague Jay Peters offered some encouragement. “It just takes practice,” he said. One of those talking flowers says as much in the game, too, just before a heinous little number where you’re forced to bounce your way through spinning fireball obstacles. It greets you every time you start the level with “Practice makes better!”

It dawned on me, as I fought the urge to throw my controller for the hundredth time, how right they were. My cousins and friends weren’t just naturally good at Mario when we were kids, they had just practiced a lot. That sounds obvious, but honestly it’s a lesson I keep learning again and again in life. How do you become a better writer? A better parent? A more confident public speaker? Maybe a few people are born naturally gifted, but for the rest of us the answer is always the same: practice. Lots of life’s challenges seem like they can only be won or lost, but usually they’re just good practice for the next thing. That’s what I keep trying to remind myself, anyway.

Lots of life’s challenges seem like they can only be won or lost, but usually they’re just good practice

The thing that makes the final-final test so stressful is that it’s difficult to get the practice you need to beat those stages. It’s demoralizing to fight your way through three challenges only to die one jump into the last stage and have to repeat it all over again. And that last stage of the final-final test is just plain rude. It’s a lot of timed jumps onto moving targets while Mario is totally invisible. Five nights into my quest to beat it, my sanity was on a razor’s edge, and I clung to my “it’s just practice” mantra as I slowly mastered the first part of the stage.",technology
"Building for tomorrow

This series is all about infrastructure: the invisible layer of wires and guts and light that makes everything run. It’s not in the best shape, but what would it take to make it better?

How do you build a better future? What systems need to be in place to ensure we have the best, most sustainable outcome for the planet? Why is so much stuff broken?

These were the questions we asked ourselves as we outlined this special issue on infrastructure. We know that things like roads and bridges and wastewater treatment facilities are what make modern life possible. But there’s a lot more to our infrastructure that mostly goes unnoticed. So let’s change that.

We explore why the next few years are pivotal for self-driving trucks, look into the broadband industry’s long history with racial discrimination, ask what it will take to get rural Americans to adopt electric vehicles, and investigate the reasons Wi-Fi is so slow in most people’s homes. We also look at some very cool stuff, like space lasers, EV battery recycling, and the enormous triumphs of a simple bike lane.",technology
"That means the purchase will bypass the congressional review requirement for foreign military sales. Such determinations are rare, but not unprecedented, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be delivered without waiting for lawmakers’ approval.

“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” the department said in a statement. “Israel will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.”

The sale is worth $106.5 million and includes 13,981 120 mm High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer tank cartridges as well as U.S. support, engineering and logistics. The materiel will come from Army inventory.

Bypassing Congress with emergency determinations for arms sales is an unusual step that has in the past met resistance from lawmakers, who normally have a period of time to weigh on proposed weapons transfers and, in some cases, block them.

In May, 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an emergency determination for an $8.1 billion sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan after it became clear that the Trump administration would have trouble overcoming lawmakers’ concerns about the Saudi- UAE-led war in Yemen.

Pompeo came under heavy criticism for the move, which some believed may have violated the law because many of the weapons involved had yet to be built and could not be delivered urgently. But he was cleared of any wrongdoing after an internal investigation.

At least four administrations have used the authority since 1979. President George H.W. Bush’s administration used it during the Gulf War to get arms quickly to Saudi Arabia.",political
"Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.

The message coming from Israel’s leaders remains unwavering and uncompromising. Come what may, they’re determined to smash Hamas for good, so it can never again carry out a pogrom like it did on October 7.

And for all the mounting pressure from Western allies to curtail its military operation that’s so far led to the elimination of about half of Hamas’ midlevel commanders in Gaza, Israel is bent on pressing forward, searching the suspected hiding places of the militant group’s upper echelon.

According to three officials in Tel Aviv who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, the administration of United States President Joe Biden has now given Israel until the end of the year to wrap up its war on Hamas — a deadline that was underlined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a visit to Israel this week. But Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer told a security forum on Thursday that the administration is not imposing a hard deadline on Israel to end its military operation in Gaza.

However, when Israeli officials outlined their plans to the top U.S. diplomat, stating that fighting in southern Gaza would last several months, reportedly Blinken tersely retorted, “You don’t have that much credit.” But Israeli leaders are prepared to incur an overdraft. They’ve defied the U.S. in the past and several times already since the attacks. They will now undoubtedly continue to do so — the question is just how far this noncompliance will go.

A senior Israeli official who POLITICO spoke to, and was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, pulled back the curtain on Israel’s defiance to date. “They advised us not to go into Gaza, but we did,” he said.

“We went into Gaza because that was the only way we could destroy Hamas and free our hostages. They told us, don’t go into the terror tunnels. But if we don’t go into the terror tunnels, there’s no way we can destroy Hamas. They told us not to go into the hospitals despite them being used by Hamas as command and control centers, but we went into those hospitals, and we did what we needed to do. And we’ll do what we need to do to reach decisive victory,” he added.

Noncompliance is in the tradition of Israeli-U.S. relations.

Back in 2007, Israel’s then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert disregarded his counterpart, President George W. Bush, after the White House shunned his request to target a suspected Syrian nuclear plant. Bush convened his national security team to discuss mounting an airstrike or a covert special forces raid, but his intelligence and military advisers were reluctant. Olmert then went ahead anyway, ordering an airstrike on the suspected reactor.

Code-named “Outside the Box,” this operation was in line with the so-called Begin Doctrine, which former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin first spoke of in 1981. The doctrine simply states Israeli policy to mount preemptive attacks so as to halt a potential enemy’s capability to possess weapons of mass destruction, and to “defend the citizens of Israel in good time and with all the means at our disposal.”

Olmert recently told POLITICO that, at the time, Bush was furious with him. Beforehand, he had “told me, ‘I am against you acting in Syria; I will not act in Syria, and I urge you not to do it.’ And I said, ‘Mr. President, with all due respect to you, I will decide what’s good for Israeli security, OK?’”

This is Israel’s attitude now when it comes to Hamas: no compromises. Israeli leaders aren’t prepared to gamble on October 7 happening again; they’re going to make sure it never can. And if that upsets allies, so be it.

But an even greater test of Israeli-American relations may be in the offing as well.

U.S. officials have worked tirelessly to try and ensure the war in Gaza doesn’t spill over to Lebanon, broadening a conflict that would guarantee inflaming the whole region. To that end, Washington dispatched two aircraft carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah from attacking Israel. And Biden publicly warned outside actors — taken to mean Iran and Hezbollah — not to get involved.

In large part, that all seemed to work, and Hezbollah and Iran haven’t opened a full second front. “A broader regional conflict has been deterred,” Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said last month.

But that could be about to change — and not because Hezbollah might initiate a full-scale confrontation but because Israel might decide to do so, seizing the moment to secure its northern border and ensure a pogrom can’t be visited on communities there.

Back in October, Mark Regev — an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — told Britain’s Spectator TV his country was ready for Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi’ite paramilitary group that he labeled a twin of Hamas. However, he gave no indication that Israel was contemplating targeting the group.

“Hezbollah could try to escalate the situation, so my message is clear: If we were caught by surprise by Hamas on Saturday morning, we are not going to be caught by surprise from the north. We are ready, we are prepared. We don’t want a war in the north but if they force one upon us, as I was saying, we are ready and we will win decisively in the north too,” he said.

Now contrast those remarks with comments made by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday to a group of mayors and municipal leaders from evacuated northern communities, located within just 10 kilometers of the Lebanese border.

Gallant intimated the Israeli government wants to soon turn its attention north, and focus on driving Hezbollah back from the Lebanese border. He said the government wouldn’t encourage some 80,000 evacuated residents to return to their homes before Hezbollah is driven back beyond the Litani River.

During the meeting, Gallant said they hoped this could be achieved through diplomatic means, otherwise Israel will “act with all the means at its disposal.”

The southern stretch of the Litani River runs parallel to the Israel-Lebanon border, 18 miles to its north. And under the terms of the U.N. resolution 1701, which brought the 2006 Lebanon war to a close, Israel agreed to withdraw all its forces from southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah was required to maintain no military presence south of the river.

But Hezbollah hasn’t kept up its end of the U.N.-brokered bargain, over the years entrenching itself in southern Lebanon, in positions overlooking Israel’s border communities. And it has used these positions to launch rocket and missile strikes that have intensified dramatically since the October 7 attacks — part of its effort to demonstrate solidarity with Hamas, short of waging a full-scale war.

Gallant has long been a hawk when it comes to Hezbollah, and Israeli press reports in October suggested he and some military commanders had pressed Netanyahu and the security Cabinet to agree a preemptive strike on Lebanon. Netanyahu, however, was cool on the idea — partly because of entreaties from U.S. officials, who fear Iran would be drawn in, upending the entire region.

But Gallant’s remarks this week were explicit, and Netanyahu is coming under increasing pressure from evacuated families and northern politicians to explain the difference between them and the communities in southern Israel.

Part of the logic of the war on Hamas is to ensure the permanent safety of the kibbutzim in southern Israel, so that families can return to take up their lives. And likewise, the 80,000 Israelis who have been evacuated from near the Lebanese border are now demanding the same safety — or they won’t go back.",political

Wait is it talking about...

[speaking Korean]

So we use Zoom often.

We called Kazuha from when she was in the Netherlands.

So we had that in our documentary.

But then we also talked to Nile Rogers over Zoom.

And then we also have this content segment

where we debate nonsense things on Zoom.

So maybe it's talking about that.

"Your dad probably isn’t going to complain about any gift you give him. For better or worse, social norms that have wide-ranging and more serious implications dictate that most modern dads don’t get hung up on presents. You know the meme of the older bearded gentleman with a goofy smile opening a shirt just like the one he has on? There’s a lot of truth to that. In fact, WIRED has gone a few years without even having a guide to gifts for dad. No one complained; it’s possible no one even noticed.

However, I am not only a dad and a gear reviewer but someone who has a very specific philosophy about what makes a good gift for middle-aged men like me. You’ll notice some threads running through this manifesto helpful guide: the best gifts for a dad are things that not only are relevant to his interests but which can be fairly described as “overkill.” Dads really tend to like things that are overbuilt but useful. I’m sure some dads like to be “pampered” but this is not me or the dads I know, who all physically cringed reading this sentence.

I’ve got lots of ideas below, but if you take away one idea I hope it’s that when it comes to a gift for a dad, you can rarely go wrong giving the best-but-spendy version of a thing we use anyway. We especially like things that win the admiration of our peers—nothing that makes a dad happier than having another dad-aged dude take note of his stupidly expensive tire pressure gauge and then saying “Oh yeah my kid got me that—they’re a little pricey but I gotta say, always works great.”

"But we have now finished four primary debates. There may not be another one before the Iowa caucuses. And Trump — who refused to participate in the process — is still running far ahead.

Whatever Trump revealed about his mindset when he said on Wednesday that he would not act like a dictator “except for Day One,” the stage on Wednesday spoke volumes about the thinking of the rest of the GOP.

We asked four POLITICO campaign reporters for their takeaways from the fourth Republican primary debate of the 2024 campaign.

Who had the best night? Who had the worst night?

Steven Shepard: DeSantis won — but, like in the first three debates, that’s only because Trump wasn’t there. DeSantis was sharp and feisty. He trained his sights on Haley from the get-go, using his first answer to attack her almost immediately. And he repeatedly invoked his military service, explicitly reminding viewers that he’s the only major candidate who’s a veteran. But DeSantis also never took direct aim at Trump, except on the former president’s age.

Ramaswamy again had the worst night. If the first three debates have taught us anything, it’s that the more Republican primary voters see of him, the less they like him.

Natalie Allison: What does it even mean to have a good night at these debates? DeSantis seemed to have a stronger performance than at some of his past debates — and it likely helped that he wasn’t the top target of the other candidates. He had more natural confidence this time around, and stayed out of the fray compared to Haley, Ramaswamy and Christie. But does that mean he convinced tens of thousands of additional Iowa caucus goers to flock to him as a result of this? No.

Haley had the worst night. By now, we expect Ramaswamy to get booed for inflammatory comments. We expect Christie to be the only one to try to go after Trump. But Haley seemed less at ease and on the defensive throughout the night. She faced questions about her net worth exploding in recent years and her embrace of Democratic donors. She was forced to defend her record on some transgender policies.

Much of what she said tonight was reactive, and a departure from her past strong performances.

Kimberly Leonard: Christie had the best night. That’s saying something, since he nearly didn’t make the debate stage at all.

But Christie managed to have some strong moments, even controlling the conversation at some turns — and putting his rivals in their place.

Tonight showed that Haley and DeSantis would benefit from a debate between just the two of them. They clearly arrived ready to go after only each other so they could keep duking it out for second place. But having even lower-polling candidates onstage fighting with them distracted from that goal. DeSantis had a strong night because he seemed to be building off momentum from his debate last week with California Gov. Gavin Newsom. At almost every turn, he portrayed Haley as left-leaning and pro-establishment as possible, whether it be on LGBTQ+ issues, tech or China.

Adam Wren: Aside from Mike Pence? If we’re talking about who is winning the race for second place, Haley had the best night, because nothing that happened tonight arrested her momentum. “I love all the attention, fellas, thank you for that,” she said.

But Christie seemed to be the only candidate who knew what time it was, and why the candidates were gathered here tonight. This is a GOP primary debate in which these candidates are arguably trying to win the race for first place, not second, and Christie was the only one who went after Trump. “They’re afraid to offend,” Christie said of his three competitors. How is he wrong? He was booed in his closing statement, but he was the only one who truly assailed the frontrunner.

What surprised you most during the debate?

Wren: Before the debate, the moderators threatened that they would give the candidates a real chance to tee off on Trump, the frontrunner in the race. There was one question about Trump, as far as I could tell.

Honestly, and maybe I shouldn’t be at this point in the race, but I was surprised by Christie, still, being the only one willing to attack Trump in the debate. “I’m looking at my watch now. We’re 17 minutes into this debate, and except for your little speech in the beginning, we’ve had these three acting as if the race is between the four of us,” he said.

Leonard: I was surprised Christie rushed to defend Haley from Ramaswamy’s attacks early in the debate. The third GOP debate showed a softer and more conciliatory side of Christie. But during this debate, he returned to the tough-guy persona voters have been familiar with, keeping Trump and Ramaswamy as his targets rather than Haley.

After hitting Ramaswamy for interrupting and being an “obnoxious blowhard,” he piled on him further for disparaging Haley’s “basic intelligence” rather than her positions. (Christie did later in the debate say that he disagreed with Haley on Trump’s trade policies, but he did so by putting down Trump more — not her.)

“This is a smart, accomplished woman,” he told Ramaswamy. “You should stop insulting her.”

Allison: It was hardly a surprise that these four candidates on stage, desperate for any shred of traction in the weeks leading up to the Iowa caucuses and the first votes being cast in New Hampshire, went after each other relentlessly. Sure, there was a moment of shock-factor with Ramaswamy calling Haley a fascist or telling Christie to go “eat a nice meal,” or Christie chiding Ramaswamy for “sitting on his smart ass at Harvard.” But given that this may be the last opportunity these candidates have to stand before a national television audience and try to end each others’ remaining path to relevance, this was the debate we all expected to see.

Shepard: I agree with Kimberly. The degree to which Christie defended Haley may only serve to highlight the calls for Christie to end his campaign before the New Hampshire primary, given his limited appeal and the risk of splitting the anti-Trump vote.

Christie barely made the debate stage this time — and even if there is another debate, he very well may not be back. Spending so much time backing up Haley could telegraph an endorsement down the road.

Did anything we saw tonight hurt Donald Trump?

Allison: My answer to this question remains the same as it was for the three debates before this — no. What could have hurt Trump about four candidates hurling insults at each other for two hours while Christie made a few of his usual attempts to disparage him?

Shepard: Airing on NewsNation and the CW network, this debate likely reached only a small audience. It’s difficult to imagine anything that happened would have disrupted Trump’s dominance over the race.

Moreover, when the only candidate actively attacking Trump is Christie — who is viewed unfavorably by a majority of Republicans — those shots aren’t landing.

Wren: No.

Leonard: None of the candidates leveled any new criticisms against Trump or presented fresh arguments about why they would be a better alternative.

How will this debate change the trajectory of the race?

Leonard: It won’t. This might be the last debate of the GOP presidential primary, and it’s hard not to speculate about how having Trump onstage would have shaken things up.

What would DeSantis’ reactions have been if Trump had towered behind him, mocked him with childish nicknames and gone after him in deeply personal ways — as he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and to Joe Biden in 2020?

Based on the polls, it seems that Trump made the right bet by staying out of it.

Wren: It won’t.

Allison: Again, no harm to Trump. If any of the rest of them see a bump from tonight, it will be marginal. Somehow, they’re still just trading points back and forth. And that does nothing to affect the trajectory of this primary.

Shepard: The Iowa caucuses are only 40 days away, and nothing that happened Wednesday in Alabama will affect that. The most credible threat to Trump’s nomination remains a candidate — either DeSantis or Haley, at this point — whose momentum and organization produces an upset victory or at least a close second.

One addendum to this: Trump skipped the debate in Iowa eight years ago, and it may have cost him a victory. If there is a debate in Des Moines in the run-up to Jan. 15, and the former president doesn’t post, there is more risk to him than there was in no-showing this one.",political
"Over the last few months, the incredulous question — How can Donald Trump possibly be leading the polls; there must be some mistake — has given way to the clear reality: Something in American life would need to change for Joe Biden to be favored for re-election in November 2024.

The good news for Biden is that it’s easy to imagine developments that would help his re-election bid. Notwithstanding a fashionable liberal despair about how bad vibes are deceiving Americans about the state of the economy, there’s plenty of room for improvements — in inflation-adjusted wages, interest rates, the stock market — that could sweeten the country’s economic mood. (Just sustaining the economic trajectory of the last few months through next summer would almost certainly boost Biden’s approval ratings.)

The looming Trump trials, meanwhile, promise to refocus the country’s persuadable voters on what they dislike about the former president; that, too, has to be worth something in the swing states where Biden is currently struggling.

In both those cases, though, the president doesn’t have much control over events. No major economic package is likely to pass Congress, and whatever influence you think his White House did or didn’t exert over Trump’s indictments, Biden staffers won’t be supervising jury selection.",political

Hello world.

My name is David J. Malan

and I'm a professor of computer science

at Harvard University.

Today, I've been asked to explain algorithms

in five levels of increasing difficulty.

Algorithms are important

because they really are everywhere,

not only in the physical world,

but certainly in the virtual world as well.

And in fact, what excites me about algorithms

is that they really represent an opportunity

to solve problems.

And I dare say, no matter what you do in life,

all of us have problems to solve.

So, I'm a computer science professor,

so I spend a lot of time with computers.

How would you define a computer for them?

Well, a computer is electronic,

like a phone but it's a rectangle,

and you can type like tick, tick, tick.

And you work on it.

Nice. Do you know any of the parts

that are inside of a computer?

No.

Can I explain a couple of them to you?

Yeah.

So, inside of every computer is some kind of brain

and the technical term for that is CPU,

or central processing unit.

And those are the pieces of hardware

that know how to respond to those instructions.

Like moving up or down, or left or right,

knows how to do math like addition and subtraction.

And then there's at least one other type of

hardware inside of a computer called memory

or RAM, if you've heard of this?

I know of memory because you have to memorize stuff.

Yeah, exactly.

And computers have even different types of memory.

They have what's called RAM, random access memory,

which is where your games, where your programs

are stored while they're being used.

But then it also has a hard drive,

or a solid state drive, which is where your data,

your high scores, your documents,

once you start writing essays and stories in the future.

It stays there.

Stays permanently.

So, even if the power goes out,

the computer can still remember that information.

It's still there because

the computer can't just like delete all of the words itself.

Hopefully not.

Because your fingers could only do that.

Like you have to use your finger to delete

all of the stuff. Exactly.

You have to write.

Yeah, have you heard of an algorithm before?

Yes. Algorithm is a list of instructions to tell people

what to do or like a robot what to do.

Yeah, exactly.

It's just step by step instructions for doing something,

for solving a problem, for instance.

Yeah, so like if you have a bedtime routine,

then at first you say, I get dressed, I brush my teeth,

I read a little story, and then I go to bed.

All right.

Well how about another algorithm?

Like what do you tend to eat for lunch?

Any types of sandwiches you like?

I eat peanut butter.

Let me get some supplies from the cupboard here.

So, should we make an algorithm together?

Yeah.

Why don't we do it this way?

Why don't we pretend like I'm a computer

or maybe I'm a robot, so I only understand your instructions

and so I want you to feed me, no pun intended, an algorithm.

So, step-by-step instructions for solving this problem.

But remember, algorithms, you have to be precise,

you have to give...

The right instructions.

[David] The right instructions.

Just do it for me. So, step one was what?

Open the bag.

[David] Okay. Opening the bag of bread.

[David] Stop. Now what?

Grab the bread and put it on the plate.

[David] Grab the bread and put it on the plate.

Take all the bread back and put it back in there.

[David laughing]

So, that's like an undo command.

Yeah.

Little control Z? Okay.

Take one bread and put it on the plate.

Okay.

Take the lid off the peanut butter.

[David] Okay, take the lid off the peanut butter.

Put the lid down.

[David] Okay. Take the knife.

[David] Take the knife.

[Addison] Put the blade inside the peanut butter

and spread the peanut butter on the bread.

I'm going to take out some peanut butter

and I'm going to spread the peanut butter on the bread.

I put a lot of peanut butter on

because I love peanut butter.

Oh, apparently. I thought I was messing with you here...

No, no it's fine.

But I think you're apparently happy with this.

[Addison] Put the knife down,

and then grab one bread and put it on top

of the second bread, sideways.

Sideways.

Like put it flat on.

Oh, flat ways, okay.

[Addison] And now, done. You're done with your sandwich.

Should we take a delicious bite?

Yep. Let's take a bite.

[David] Okay, here we go.

What would the next step be here?

Clean all this mess up.

[David laughing]

Clean all this mess up, right.

We made an algorithm, step by step instructions

for solving some problem.

And if you think about now,

how we made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,

sometimes we were imprecise and you didn't give me

quite enough information to do the algorithm correctly,

and that's why I took out so much bread.

Precision, being very, very correct with your instructions

is so important in the real world

because for instance, when you're using the worldwide web

and you're searching for something on Google or Bing...

You want to do the right thing.

[David] Exactly.

So, like if you type in just Google,

then you won't find the answer to your question.

Pretty much everything we do in life is an algorithm,

even if we don't use that fancy word to describe it.

Because you and I are sort of following instructions

either that we came up with ourselves

or maybe our parents told us how to do these things.

And so, those are just algorithms.

But when you start using algorithms in computers,

that's when you start writing code.

[upbeat music]

What do you know about algorithms?

Nothing really, at all honestly.

I think it's just probably a way to store information

in computers.

And I dare say, even though you might not have

put this word on it, odds are you executed as a human,

multiple algorithms today even before you came here today.

Like what were a few things that you did?

I got ready.

Okay. And get ready. What does that mean?

Brushing my teeth, brushing my hair.

[David] Okay.

Getting dressed.

Okay, so all of those, frankly, if we really

dove more deeply, could be broken down into

step-by-step instructions.

And presumably your mom, your dad, someone in the past

sort of programmed you as a human to know what to do.

And then after that, as a smart human,

you can sort of take it from there

and you don't need their help anymore.

But that's kind of what we're doing

when we program computers.

Something maybe even more familiar nowadays,

like odds are you have a cell phone.

Your contacts or your address book.

But let me ask you why that is.

Like why does Apple or Google or anyone else

bother alphabetizing your contacts?

I just assumed it would be easier to navigate.

What if your friend happened to be at the very bottom

of this randomly organized list?

Why is that a problem? Like he or she's still there.

I guess it would take a while to get to

while you're scrolling.

That, in of itself, is kind of a problem

or it's an inefficient solution to the problem.

So, it turns out that back in my day,

before there were cell phones, everyone's numbers

from my schools were literally printed in a book,

and everyone in my town and my city, my state

was printed in an actual phone book.

Even if you've never seen this technology before,

how would you propose verbally to find John

in this phone book? Or I would just flip through

and just look for the J's I guess.

Yeah. So, let me propose that we start that way.

I could just start at the beginning

and step by step I could just look at each page,

looking for John, looking for John.

Now even if you've never seen this here technology before,

it turns out this is exactly what your phone could be doing

in software, like someone from Google or Apple or the like,

they could write software that uses a technique

in programming known as a loop,

and a loop, as the word implies,

is just sort of do something again and again.

What if instead of starting from the beginning

and going one page at a time,

what if I, or what if your phone goes like two pages

or two names at a time?

Would this be correct do you think?

Well you could skip over John, I think.

In what sense?

If he's in one of the middle pages that you skipped over.

Yeah, so sort of accidentally and frankly

with like 50/50 probability,

John could get sandwiched in between two pages.

But does that mean I have to throw

that algorithm out altogether?

Maybe you could use that strategy until you get close

to the section and then switch to going one by one.

Okay, that's nice.

So, you could kind of like go twice as fast

but then kind of pump the brakes as you near your exit

on the highway, or in this case near the J section

of the book.

Exactly.

And maybe alternatively, if I get to like

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K,

if I get to the K section,

then I could just double back like one page

just to make sure John didn't get sandwiched

between those pages.

So, the nice thing about that second algorithm

is that I'm flying through the phone book

like two pages at a time.

So, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.

It's not perfect, it's not necessarily correct

but it is if I just take one extra step.

So, I think it's fixable,

but what your phone is probably doing

and frankly what I and like my parents and grandparents

used to do back in the day was we'd probably go roughly

to the middle of the phone book here,

and just intuitively, if this is an alphabetized phone book

in English, what section am I probably going to

find myself in roughly?

K?

Okay. So, I'm in the K section.

Is John going to be to the left or to the right?

To the left.

Yeah.

So, John is going to be to the left or the right

and what we can do here, though your phone

does something smarter, is tear the problem in half,

throw half of the problem away,

being left with just 500 pages now.

But what might I next do?

I could sort of naively just start at the beginning again,

but we've learned to do better.

I can go roughly to the middle here.

And you can do it again. Yeah, exactly.

So, now maybe I'm in the E section,

which is a little to the left.

So, John is clearly going to be to the right,

so I can again tear the problem poorly in half,

throw this half of the problem away,

and I claim now that if we started with a thousand pages,

now we've gone to 500, 250,

now we're really moving quickly.

Yeah.

[David] And so, eventually I'm hopefully dramatically

left with just one single page

at which point John is either on that page

or not on that page, and I can call him.

Roughly how many steps might this third algorithm take

if I started with a thousand pages

then went to 500, 250, 125,

how many times can you divide 1,000 in half? Maybe?

10.

That's roughly roughly 10.

Because in the first algorithm,

looking again for someone like Zoe in the worst case

might have to go all the way through a thousand pages.

But the second algorithm you said was 500,

maybe 501, essentially the same thing.

So, twice as fast.

But this third and final algorithm is sort of fundamentally

faster because you're sort of dividing and conquering it

in half, in half, in half,

not just taking one or two bites out of it out of a time.

So, this of course is not how we used to use phone books

back in the day since otherwise they'd be single use only.

But it is how your phone is actually searching for Zoe,

for John, for anyone else, but it's doing it in software.

Oh, that's cool.

So, here we've happened to focus on searching algorithms,

looking for John in the phone book.

But the technique we just used

can indeed be called divide and conquer,

where you take a big problem and you divide and conquer it,

that is you try to chop it up into smaller,

smaller, smaller pieces.

A more sophisticated type of algorithm,

at least depending on how you implement it,

something known as a recursive algorithm.

Recursive algorithm is essentially an algorithm

that uses itself to solve the exact same problem

again and again, but chops it smaller, and smaller,

and smaller ultimately.

Hi, my name's Patricia.

Patricia, nice to meet you.

Where are you a student at?

I am starting my senior year now at NYU.

Oh nice. And what have you been studying

the past few years?

I studied computer science and data science.

If you were chatting with a non-CS,

non-data science friend of yours,

how would you explain to them what an algorithm is?

Some kind of systematic way of solving a problem,

or like a set of steps to kind of solve

a certain problem you have.

So, you probably recall learning topics

like binary search versus linear search, and the like.

Yeah.

So, I've come here complete with a

actual chalkboard with some magnetic numbers on it here.

How would you tell a friend to sort these?

I think one of the first things we learned was

something called bubble sort.

It was kind of like focusing on smaller bubbles

I guess I would say of the problem,

like looking at smaller segments rather than

the whole thing at once.

What is I think very true about what you're hinting at

is that bubble sort really focuses on local, small problems

rather than taking a step back trying to fix

the whole thing, let's just fix the obvious problems

in front of us. So, for instance, when we're trying to get

from smallest to largest,

and the first two things we see are eight followed by one,

this looks like a problem 'cause it's out of order.

So, what would be the simplest fix,

the least amount of work we can do

to at least fix one problem?

Just switch those two numbers

'cause one is obviously smaller than eight.

Perfect. So, we just swap those two then.

You would switch those again.

Yeah, so that further improves the situation

and you can kind of see it,

that the one and the two are now in place.

How about eight and six?

[Patricia] Switch it again.

Switch those again. Eight and three?

Switch it again.

[fast forwarding]

And conversely now the one and the two are closer to,

and coincidentally are exactly where we want them to be.

So, are we done?

No.

Okay, so obviously not, but what could we do now

to further improve the situation?

Go through it again but you don't need

to check the last one anymore because we know

that number is bubbled up to the top.

Yeah, because eight has indeed bubbled all the way

to the top. So, one and two?

[Patricia] Yeah, keep it as is.

Okay, two and six?

[Patricia] Keep it as is.

Okay, six and three?

Then you switch it.

Okay, we'll switch or swap those.

Six and four?

[Patricia] Swap it again.

Okay, so four, six and seven?

[Patricia] Keep it.

Okay. Seven and five?

[Patricia] Swap it.

Okay. And then I think per your point,

we're pretty darn close.

Let's go through once more.

[Patricia] One and two? Keep it.

[Patricia] Two three? Keep it.

[Patricia] Three four? Keep it.

[Patricia] Four six? Keep it.

Six five?

[Patricia] And then switch it.

All right, we'll switch this. And now to your point,

we don't need to bother with the ones

that already bubbled their way up.

Now we are a hundred percent sure it's sorted.

Yeah.

And certainly the search engines of the world,

Google and Bing and so forth,

they probably don't keep webpages in sorted order

'cause that would be a crazy long list

when you're just trying to search the data.

But there's probably some algorithm underlying what they do

and they probably similarly, just like we,

do a bit of work upfront to get things organized

even if it's not strictly sorted in the same way

so that people like you and me and others

can find that same information.

So, how about social media?

Can you envision where the algorithms are in that world?

Maybe for example like TikTok, like the For You page,

'cause those are like recommendations, right?

It's sort of like Netflix recommendations

except more constant because it's just every video

you scroll, it's like that's a new recommendation basically.

And it's based on what you've liked previously,

what you've saved previously, what you search up.

So, I would assume there's some kind of algorithm there

kind of figuring out like what to put on your For You page.

Absolutely. Just trying to keep you presumably

more engaged.

So, the better the algorithm is,

the better your engagement is,

maybe the more money the company then makes on the platform

and so forth.

So, it all sort of feeds together.

But what you're describing really is more

artificially intelligent, if I may,

because presumably there's not someone at TikTok

or any of these social media companies saying,

If Patricia likes this post, then show her this post.

If she likes this post, then show her this other post.

Because the code would sort of grow infinitely long

and there's just way too much content for a programmer

to be having those kinds of conditionals,

those decisions being made behind the scenes.

So, it's probably a little more artificially intelligent.

And in that sense you have topics like neural networks,

and machine learning which really describe

taking as input things like what you watch,

what you click on, what your friends watch,

what they click on, and sort of trying to infer

from that instead, what should we show Patricia

or her friends next?

Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

That makes like the distinction more...

Makes more sense now.

Nice. Yeah.

[upbeat music]

I am currently a fourth year PhD student at NYU.

I do robot learning, so that's half and half

robotics and machine learning.

Sounds like you've dabbled with quite a few algorithms.

So, how does one actually research algorithms

or invent algorithms?

The most important way is just trying to think about

inefficiencies, and also think about connecting threads.

The way I think about it is that algorithm for me

is not just about the way of doing something,

but it's about doing something efficiently.

Learning algorithms are practically everywhere now.

Google, I would say for example,

is learning every day about like,

Oh what articles, what links might be better than others?

And re-ranking them.

There are recommender systems all around us, right?

Like content feeds and social media,

or you know, like YouTube or Netflix.

What we see is in a large part determined by this kind of

learning algorithms.

Nowadays there's a lot of concerns

around some applications of machine learning

like deep fakes where it can kind of learn how I talk

and learn how you talk and even how we look,

and generate videos of us.

We're doing this for real, but you could imagine

a computer synthesizing this conversation eventually.

Right.

But how does it even know what I sound like

and what I look like, and how to replicate that?

All of this learning algorithms that we talk about, right?

A lot, like what goes in there is just

lots and lots of data.

So, data goes in, something else comes out.

What comes out is whatever objective function

that you optimize for.

Where is the line between algorithms that

play games with and without AI?

I think when I started off my undergrad,

the current AI machine learning

was not very much synonymous.

Okay.

And even in my undergraduate, in the AI class,

they learned a lot of classical algorithms for game plays.

Like for example, the A star search, right?

That's a very simple example of how you can play a game

without having anything learned.

This is very much, oh you are at a game state,

you just search down, see what are the possibilities

and then you pick the best possibility that it can see,

versus what you think about when you think about,

ah yes, gameplay like the alpha zero for example,

or alpha star, or there are a lot of, you know,

like fancy new machine learning agents that are

even learning very difficult games like Go.

And those are learned agents, as in they are getting better

as they play more and more games.

And as they get more games, they kind of

refine their strategy based on the data that I've seen.

And once again, this high level abstraction

is still the same.

You see a lot of data and you'll learn from that.

But the question is what is objective function

that you're optimizing for?

Is it winning this game?

Is it forcing a tie or is it, you know,

opening a door in a kitchen?

So, if the world is very much focused on supervised,

unsupervised reinforcement learning now,

what comes next five, ten years, where is the world going?

I think that this is just going to be more and more,

I don't want to use the word encroachment,

but that's what it feels like of algorithms

into our everyday life.

Like even when I was taking the train here, right?

The trains are being routed with algorithms,

but this has existed for you know, like 50 years probably.

But as I was coming here, as I was checking my phone,

those are different algorithms,

and you know, they're kind of getting all around us,

getting there with us all the time.

They're making our life better most places, most cases.

And I think that's just going to be a continuation

of all of those.

And it feels like they're even in places

you wouldn't expect, and there's just so much data

about you and me and everyone else online

and this data is being mined and analyzed,

and influencing things we see and hear it would seem.

So, there is sort of a counterpoint which might be good

for the marketers, but not necessarily good for you and me

as individuals.

We are human beings, but for someone

we might be just a pair of eyes who are

carrying a wallet, and are there to buy things.

But there is so much more potential for these algorithms

to just make our life better without

changing much about our life.

I'm Chris Wiggins. I'm an associate professor

of Applied Mathematics at Columbia.

I'm also the chief data scientist of the New York Times.

The data science team at the New York Times

develops and deploys machine learning

for newsroom and business problems.

But I would say the things that we do mostly, you don't see,

but it might be things like personalization algorithms,

or recommending different content.

And do data scientists, which is rather distinct

from the phrase computer scientists.

Do data scientists still think in terms of algorithms

as driving a lot of it?

Oh absolutely, yeah.

In fact, so in data science and academia,

often the role of the algorithm is

the optimization algorithm that helps you find the best

model or the best description of a data set.

And data science and industry, the goal,

often it's centered around an algorithm

which becomes a data product.

So, a data scientist in industry might be

developing and deploying the algorithm,

which means not only understanding the algorithm

and its statistical performance,

but also all of the software engineering

around systems integration, making sure that that algorithm

receives input that's reliable and has output that's useful,

as well as I would say the organizational integration,

which is how does a community of people

like the set of people working at the New York Times

integrate that algorithm into their process?

Interesting. And I feel like AI based startups

are all the rage and certainly within academia.

Are there connections between AI

and the world of data science?

Oh, absolutely.

The algorithms that they're in,

can you connect those dots for...

You're right that AI as a field has really exploded.

I would say particularly many people experienced a ChatBot

that was really, really good.

Today, when people say AI,

they're often thinking about large language models,

or they're thinking about generative AI,

or they might be thinking about a ChatBot.

One thing to keep in mind is a ChatBot is a special case

of generative AI, which is a special case of using

large language models, which is a special case of using

machine learning generally,

which is what most people mean by AI.

You may have moments that are what John McCarthy called,

Look Ma, no hands, results,

where you do some fantastic trick and you're not quite sure

how it worked.

I think it's still very much early days.

Large language models is still in the point of

what might be called alchemy and that people are building

large language models without a real clear,

a priori sense of what the right design is

for a right problem.

Many people are trying different things out,

often in large companies where they can afford

to have many people trying things out,

seeing what works, publishing that,

instantiating it as a product.

And that itself is part of the scientific process

I would think too.

Yeah, very much. Well, science and engineering,

because often you're building a thing

and the thing does something amazing.

To a large extent we are still looking for

basic theoretical results around why

deep neural networks generally work.

Why are they able to learn so well?

They're huge, billions of parameter models

and it's difficult for us to interpret

how they're able to do what they do.

And is this a good thing, do you think?

Or an inevitable thing that we, the programmers,

we, the computer scientists, the data scientists

who are inventing these things,

can't actually explain how they work?

Because I feel like friends of mine in industry,

even when it's something simple and relatively familiar

like auto complete, they can't actually tell me

why that name is appearing at the top of the list.

Whereas years ago when these algorithms were more

deterministic and more procedural,

you could even point to the line that made that name

[Chris] bubble up to the top. Absolutely.

So, is this a good thing, a bad thing,

that we're sort of losing control perhaps in some sense

of the algorithm?

It has risks.

I don't know that I would say that it's good or bad,

but I would say there's lots of scientific precedent.

There are times when an algorithm works really well

and we have finite understanding of why it works

or a model works really well

and sometimes we have very little understanding

of why it works the way it does.

In classes I teach, certainly spend a lot of time on

fundamentals, algorithms that have been taught in classes

for decades now, whether it's binary search,

linear search, bubble sorts, selection sort or the like,

but if we're already at the point where I can pull up

chat GPT, copy paste a whole bunch of numbers or words

and say, Sort these for me,

does it really matter how Chat GPT is sorting it?

Does it really matter to me as the user

how the software is sorting it?

Do these fundamentals become more dated and less important

do you think?

Now you're talking about the ways in which code

and computation is a special case of technology, right?

So, for driving a car, you may not necessarily need

to know much about organic chemistry,

even though the organic chemistry is how the car works.

So, you can drive the car and use it in different ways

without understanding much about the fundamentals.

So, similarly with computation, we're at a point

where the computation is so high level, right?

You can import psychic learn and you can go from zero

to machine learning in 30 seconds.

It's depending on what level you want to understand

the technology, where in the stack, so to speak,

it's possible to understand it and make wonderful things

and advance the world without understanding it

at the particular level of somebody who actually might have

originally designed the actual optimization algorithm.

I should say though, for many of the optimization

algorithms, there are cases where an algorithm

works really well and we publish a paper,

and there's a proof in the paper,

and then years later people realize

actually that proof was wrong and we're really

still not sure why that optimization works,

but it works really well or it inspires people

to make new optimization algorithms.

So, I do think that the goal of understanding algorithms

is loosely coupled to our progress

and advancing grade algorithms, but they don't always

necessarily have to require each other.

And for those students especially,

or even adults who are thinking of now steering into

computer science, into programming,

who were really jazzed about heading in that direction

up until, for instance, November of 2022,

when all of a sudden for many people

it looked like the world was now changing

and now maybe this isn't such a promising path,

this isn't such a lucrative path anymore.

Are LLMs, are tools like Chat GPT reason not to perhaps

steer into the field?

Large language models are a particular architecture

for predicting, let's say the next word,

or a set of tokens more generally.

The algorithm comes in when you think about

how is that LLM to be trained or also how to be fine tuned.

So, the P of GPT is a pre-trained algorithm.

The idea is that you train a large language model

on some corpus of text, could be encyclopedias,

or textbooks, or what have you.

And then you might want to fine tune that model

around some particular task or

some particular subset of texts.

So, both of those are examples of training algorithms.

So, I would say people's perception

of artificial intelligence has really changed a lot

in the last six months, particularly around November of 2022

when people experienced a really good ChatBot.

The technology though had been around already before.

Academics had already been working with Chat GPT three

before that and GPT two and GPT one.

And for many people it sort of opened up this conversation

about what is artificial intelligence

and what could we do with this?

And what are the possible good and bad, right?

Like any other piece of technology.

Kranzburg's first law of technology,

technology is neither good, nor bad, nor is it neutral.

Every time we have some new technology,

we should think about it's capabilities

and the good, and the possible bad.

[David] As with any area of study,

algorithms offer a spectrum from the most basic

to the most advanced.

And even if right now, the most advanced of those algorithms

feels out of reach because you just

don't have that background,

with each lesson you learn, with each algorithm you study,

that end game becomes closer and closer

such that it will, before long, be accessible to you

and you will be at the end of that most advanced spectrum.",technology

My name's Caitlyn Schrepfer.

I've been challenged to do freestyle soccer skills

in 25 levels of increasing complexity.

[upbeat electronic music]

Freestyle soccer is unique in that it really is the art

of movement with the ball.

To me, complexity is increasingly difficult techniques

and fluidity of movement.

There truly are an unlimited amount of tricks,

but this is my personal interpretation of the challenge.

Level one, knee juggles.

We're starting with knee juggles

because they are the simplest thing

for an absolute beginner to learn.

The most common mistake is people actually make contact

with their literal knee, but it's actually

on the thigh where you wanna hit the ball.

You will drop it from your hands.

Bring your leg up to contact the ball

with about the middle of your thigh.

You wanna start with one juggle

at a time right back to your hands,

and then do two and then alternating right, left

before you start doing multiple knee juggles.

Most people tend to bend over just a little bit,

but make sure you're not bringing your chest down

to the ball, but you're bringing your knees up.

Level two, feet juggles.

Feet juggles require a couple

of more techniques than just knee juggles.

It's about the positioning of your foot.

It's locking your ankle.

It's striking the ball right on the knuckle of your big toe,

and you'll know if you make proper contact

because the ball shouldn't have too much back spin on it.

You want 50% or less of your power when you're juggling.

It's not striking the ball like you would in soccer,

but it's also not a hacky sack lift.

It's a light swing as if you were sitting

in your chair just like this.

Level three, foot stalls.

The techniques in order to learn a foot stall

and balance a foot stall really come in helpful

for later levels when you get into things like head stalls

and things like that.

The best way to start is to start with the ball

in your hands and literally place it onto your foot.

Sometimes you wanna pull your toe back

to help cushion the ball

and control it right there between your toes and your shin.

You'll know you have the foot stall down

when you can just kind of stand there more relaxed

and you don't really ever feel out of control.

Now that we've got foot stalls, knees and feet juggles,

let's move on to level four, flick ups.

Flick ups are the techniques that you use to get the ball

from the ground into the air to start freestyle.

For the most basic flick up, you roll the ball back

and you just chip your toe right underneath the ball

to pop it in the air a little bit.

When you wanna get a little bit more interesting,

you go from the inside, from the outside.

You can even flick it up with your heel,

but that becomes a little bit more complicated.

There's a whole spectrum of flick ups.

One of my favorite flick ups is called a slap.

You start with the ball in between your ankles.

You roll your right foot behind your left

and with your right foot,

you roll the ball up your left leg to flick the ball

up in the air and start juggling.

Level five, blocks.

Sidebar, freestyle can be broken down

into 40 different categories, lowers, any sort

of revolutions and tricks you do standing up, uppers,

which are tricks that you do chest and above, sitdowns,

which are any tricks you do when you're sitting

or laying down on the ground.

Blocks are any sorts

of catches with the ball, whether it's your knees, ankles,

that's a block, the knee catch.

Drop the ball with some backspin,

let it bounce, and then catch the ball nice

and gently between your knees.

So with the ankle catch, you want the ball in

between your ankles right on the bone, whereas a foot stall,

the ball is staying right on top of your foot.

The key with blocks is everything is gentle.

You don't wanna squeeze the ball too hard.

So even with these five levels,

you can already start to build your own freestyle combo.

As simple as a flick up into a couple of juggles.

Level six, crossovers.

They are introduction to lowers.

They're what we call a half a revolution trick.

You can do it off of a juggle or even off foot stalls.

After you flick that ball up,

you wanna swing your left foot over the ball,

and then you hop up to make contact with the ball.

You wanna make sure your body weight is centered still,

and you're standing mostly upright,

if not a little bent over.

You wanna hit about the same place

that you do when you're juggling.

So when you juggle,

your foot is about parallel to the ground.

When you do crossovers,

you wanna pull your toe back just a little bit

to keep the ball closer.

Level seven, hop the world.

We're moving from a 0.5 revolution trick

into the hop the world, which is one full revolution.

Hop the world is a little more complicated

because you actually incorporate both feet.

You start with your left foot

and you end with your right foot.

With crossover, the left foot is there,

but it doesn't actually touch the ball at any point.

From here, we can start to build a more interesting combo.

You have a couple of lowers tricks now, and we could build

with what we call the basics of freestyle.

Level eight, around the world.

Around the world is the most famous trick

in freestyle soccer.

You might've seen Ronaldinho do it.

You've seen it from the Joga Bonito ads.

It is a one revolution lowers trick where you start

with say your right foot, one revolution around the ball,

and then you end with a touch with your right foot.

When you're normally juggling with the ball,

you hit just like this,

but when you're doing it around the world, you're slicing,

which gives it a little bit of spin.

A lot of the times, people will kick the ball

and then try to get their foot around.

That presents a couple of issues.

One, the ball tends to go too high, and then two,

in splitting that into two different motions,

the kick and then the revolution, you lose time,

and it's a lot harder to get your foot around in time.

When you do it in one fluid motion,

you get the ball with the right height,

and you have the time to get your foot all the way over.

Level nine, Touzani around the world.

Touzani is actually the name of the creator of this trick,

one of the more notable figures in freestyle.

The Touzani around the world is a 1.5 revolution trick,

which is one full revolution,

and then a half a revolution to finish.

So you strike with the knuckle of your small toe right here,

one full revolution around like an around the world,

and then to finish, it's a crossover motion at the end.

The difficulty with this is striking the ball

with the outside of your foot

is a smaller surface and a lot less room

for error than it is with the inside of your foot.

Level 10, Lemmens around the world.

Lemmens around the world

is the most recognizable two revolution trick.

Imagine your right foot is starting in the air,

and that's the one that's going to be interacting

with the ball.

You're jumping off your left foot

and doing the revolutions with your right.

It's the same striking technique as the around the world.

But the difference with this one

as you make contact with that ball,

you wanna hop up off your other foot

to give you a little more height.

You're making contact here, but at the same time,

you're jumping and you make that first revolution,

complete the second revolution as you come down,

and then you finish the trick.

Level eleven, advanced blocks.

Advanced blocks, you can take the basic blocks

and then you start to spice it up a little bit.

So rather than knee catch straight down to an ankle catch,

you go from a knee catch into a crossed ankle catch.

Or you could do things like a thigh grab

and then pop the ball back up to start juggling.

Advanced blocks could come in

in a routine, say after a basic block like a knee catch.

You go knee to like, X ankle catch, a slap flick up.

It is the spice

of the routine rather than just the building blocks.

Level twelve, clipper.

Clipper is one of the more famous tricks in freestyle.

It is a stall the same way that you do a foot stall,

but with clipper, it's on the inside of your foot

while your right leg is wrapped behind your left leg.

The biggest difficulty when it comes

to clipper is your foot positioning

because you have to flex your ankle so that it sits parallel

to the ground with the inside of your foot face up,

which is actually not a natural position

for anybody's foot to do,

so a lot of people have to stretch their foot

in order to get it to reach that position.

Now that we've started to incorporate a little bit of spice

into our routine, we can get a little more interesting.

Now we're gonna move to the floor,

and we're gonna do level thirteen, sitdowns.

Sitdown crossovers are one

of the simplest tricks that you can learn sitting down.

You wanna be sitting upright, hands on the floor behind you,

cross your left leg over the top,

and make contact with your right foot.

When it comes to sitdowns,

the biggest difference is in the foot positioning.

Lock your ankle still, but rather than parallel

to the floor, it's a little bit more pointed,

and you wanna make contact with the same part of your foot.

But the key with this

is your foot can't be super far from you.

You need to keep your knees bent

and your feet close to your chest.

Whenever I think of sitdown crossovers,

I always remember the show when I had to learn them.

I was front and center on the stage on Broadway,

and I was probably about six, seven months into freestyle.

I had to do sitdown crossovers

never having learned them before.

And so now every time I do them,

I just get a nice little flashback.

Level 14, sole stall.

So with sole stall, you're going to be laying on your back.

Your leg's going to be up in the air almost locked out,

and the ball's going to be balancing on the sole

of your foot while it's right above you.

The easiest way to train this is to just place the ball

on top of your sole and learn to balance it.

It's an awkward thing for most people,

and you really have to learn the technique

of just balancing the ball at first.

You're ready to learn a sole stall

when you have basic sitdowns down,

you need the patience that it takes to learn all

of the previous tricks in order to learn sole stall.

It took me eight months.

Level 15, raised sole stall swipes.

Same technique as a sole stall,

except now you're rolling back,

so you're just balancing on your shoulders.

Your hands are supporting your waist,

and your leg is gonna be a little bit higher up in the air.

You have that ball balanced in a stall.

You're gonna pop the ball up,

and you're gonna swipe your left leg underneath the ball

and then catch it again.

So it's here, pop the ball up, swipe under, and catch.

[upbeat electronic music]

Level 16, thigh pop.

Thigh pop is often used as one

of the most beginner transitions,

but it can be used just as a trick in and of itself.

So with the thigh pop, you'll start sitting down.

You'll catch the ball right behind your leg in a thigh grab,

you wanna roll onto your side,

point the ball up towards the sky,

and you'll straighten your leg to pop the ball up.

Level 17, no touch combo.

No touch combos are combinations of two or more tricks.

Take a crossover and Touzani, but the difference here is

that you're not doing the two tricks individually.

You're taking out all

of the excess touches to make it one fluid combination.

To do a no touch combo,

you take out the extra trick in the middle, crossover,

and you would go straight into a Touzani.

Level 18, head stall.

Now we're moving on to uppers, and head stall

is the most basic uppers building block to learn.

The ball is on your hairline.

You wanna make sure you're looking up

at the ball the whole time,

and you wanna stand a little bit upright

with your head tilted back

and your knees bent just a little bit.

Head stalls coming in at level 18 because in a combo,

you would be kicking the ball up

and then balancing the ball from there.

But you're working with your head here

so you can't really flex your head or things like that,

and it's really about using your entire body

to cushion the ball,

and you shift your whole body weight to balance the ball.

Level 19, around the moon.

On around the moon, your head is moving around the ball

rather than the ball moving around your head this time.

You would start from a neck stall.

You would flick it up to the side,

and your head and your chest rotate

around the ball to catch again on the back of your neck.

The way I explain to everyone is

you kind of have chicken wings.

The ball is sitting on the back of your neck.

From there, rotate off to the side

and flick the ball up at the same time,

almost like tossing it up to the side.

You're really just isolating your upper body.

Your feet should stay planted,

and it's just your chest and head that are moving.

Level 20, lip stall.

Lip stall is a little bit harder than

around the moon because you're working

with a very small surface to balance the ball with,

and it's not flat.

Your lips are in an odd place where there's not a lot

of body behind it.

When you're doing it,

you're tilted back and your lips are right here.

You really have to get the perfect positioning

to stall that ball for more than say a second at a time.

To do a combo incorporating a lip stall,

typically I would do something like neck stall,

around the moon into a head stall, and then the simplest way

to transition into a lip stall would be tilt your head back

and let the ball roll down right onto your lips.

Level 21, Lemmens Mitch around the world.

The Lemmens Mitch name comes from the creators

of two individual tricks with the techniques combined.

So a Lemmens Mitch around the world

is a 2.5 revolution trick.

You jump off your left foot, you make the two revolutions.

That last revolution has to be a little bit quicker

because at the same time,

that left leg will come over the ball,

cross over the top, and then you pop the ball up.

This one is a little bit more complex

because it requires a lot more speed.

It requires a little bit more power

in your jump than say, a Lemmens around the world.

If you're trying to become a complete,

well-rounded freestyler learning all

of the different four categories,

you would want to learn the basics of every category

before you start incorporating the higher difficulty tricks.

Things like anything

above a two revolution trick that require weeks

and months of practice.

Level 22, transitions.

Transition is any trick

that will take you from one category to another,

whether it's lowers to sitdowns, sitdowns to lowers.

So we briefly mentioned transition tricks before,

but we're putting it as level 22

because now you're starting to incorporate fluidly

in the middle of a combo, not just at the end.

For this one, it would be a step

over slap into sitting down.

You would go from a knee catch,

drop it like you're doing a crossed ankle catch,

but right away, you're going to roll the ball up the back

of your left leg, duck under the ball,

and then transition to sitting down.

There's really no set in stone number of transition tricks.

They are how everyone expresses their own personal style.

It is kind of the pinnacle

of personal flare when it comes to freestyle.

These advanced combos become a lot more complex

because you're taking out all

of the unnecessary touches and you're replacing them

with little bits of personal flares.

[upbeat electronic music]

Level 23, acrobatic tricks.

These tricks are anything from like, flips to handstands.

I used to be a gymnast, so I incorporate a lot

of gymnastic movements into my tricks.

Flip tricks are anything like a kip-up.

When you're laying on your back,

the ball is stalled in a sole stall, roll back a little bit,

push off of your hands, kick up into a standing position.

Level 24 is my signature trick, cat flip.

It comes from rhythmic gymnastics.

You start with the ball in a neck stall,

and you will kick up into a handstand.

The ball is still stalled on the back of your neck,

flip your feet over your head into a back bend.

The ball is still caught between the back

of your neck and the lower part of your back.

From there, you'll stand up and drop it into a thigh catch.

[electronic music]

Level 25, the final combo.

The point of the final combo is to fully express yourself.

It's really about taking all

of the small techniques that you can

and incorporating as many as you possibly can.

You wanna do the big tricks,

the Lemmens Mitch around the world, the transitions.

But what really creates the full combo

is the small style points that you add in between.

You don't wanna see a seam.

It's like when you create clothing,

you don't wanna see the seam of the clothing.

It's one fluid, almost dance routine.

[upbeat electronic music]

The beauty of freestyle is that there's no limits to it.

We're constantly inventing new tricks, more revolutions,

more acrobatics, more unique tricks.

This challenge was so interesting to do

because it kind of felt like a very condensed journey

through all of my 10 years of freestyle,

but also, it's making me reexamine freestyle

through the lens of someone just starting it all over again.

Now that I have all of these techniques,

now that I've incorporated my own personal style,

it's making me see how I can share that with you

and see what kind of freestyles we can create.

Take your time, be patient, and you'll get there.",technology
"Transcript

Good afternoon, good afternoon.

My name is Jason Barham, I'm a senior writer at Wired.

I cover social media, pop culture, visual politics,

and intersection of race and technology.

Today I have the immense, immense pleasure

of speaking with Blitz Bazawule

about art and storytelling in the AI era.

Blitz is an award-winning Ghanaian filmmaker,

musician, author, and storyteller.

He's the director of the highly anticipated

The Color Purple movie,

which is set to release on Christmas Day.

It's produced by Oprah, Steven Spielberg, stars Fantasia,

it's gonna be incredible.

Blitz's featured directorial debut,

The Burial of Kojo released on Netflix in 2019.

In addition to his experience as a filmmaker,

Blitz is an accomplished musician and visual artist

having released four studio albums.

He received a Grammy nomination for his work with Beyonce

on her visual album, Black Is King.

Please welcome him to the stage, Blitz Bazawule.

[audience applauding] [bright pop music]

[bright pop music continues]

So for audience members

who are maybe not familiar with the story,

this big movie you have coming out in December,

what is The Color Purple about?

First of all, how's everybody doing?

[audience cheering and applauding]

Fantastic. [audience applauding]

The Color Purple is a story of Celie,

a black woman growing up

in the rural south

between 1909 and 1947.

And, you know, it just follows her trials, tribulation,

and her path to self liberation and ultimate triumph.

It was truly an honor to get to reimagine

this brilliant, brilliant text written originally by

the legendary Alice Walker.

And this brilliant, brilliant book became

a cinematic classic courtesy of Steven Spielberg and

went on to Broadway,

became a Tony Award-winning Broadway show.

So there was absolutely no pressure

when I decided to take this on at all.

Where's the, sort of the both,

this is a bit about AI as well and storytelling,

there's a lot of criticism where sort of

the hope and the horror of AI or Gen AI is that

it builds upon existing data sets,

which is essentially what you've done with

the sort of re-imagining of The Color Purple.

Where do you find the beauty in the re-imagining

for you personally?

Where do you source that? Where do you find that?

Well, I mean,

the human mind and its ability to create

these expansive, sometimes disconnected, disjointed

stimuli, right?

Cannot in any way

be compared to artificial intelligence, I don't think.

We're wired differently, you know?

And when I take on a film that is as

historied and as layered as The Color Purple

I'm bringing, [clears throat]

I'm not just taking The Color Purple,

I'm taking my background as a Ghanaian artist

born on the continent of Africa

and the complexities and layering

that an African perspective has

in terms of rhythm, cadence, culture,

those are things that I bring to this story.

So, in spite of Steven's incredible classic,

my film is completely different

and it's completely different based

strictly on my perspective on life and the world.

What it feels to be an outsider looking in.

That for me is truly, or was for me truly

the reason I said yes was because

I knew for a fact

that the human being is incapable of creating a

carbon copy of anything.

That's the one blessing we have.

So we can be biters, we bite,

but we can never reproduce and Xerox

'cause it's always gonna be filtered through

that soul, okay? That living, breathing, organic thing.

And for me, given Celie an imagination

was my way into this story

because I grew up around people who had been through

trauma and abuse and had seen them in their heads

create pathways of liberation

and those pathways of liberation

are often not talked about.

We often miscategorize people

who have been through trauma and abuse as docile,

as passive, waiting to be saved.

Couldn't be further from the truth.

We're constantly working in our heads.

So that was my way into The Color Purple

and it's very individual,

it's like your thumbprint, you know?

As they say, no two thump prints are the same,

I mean, that's pretty much what art in my opinion is

and why it truly differs

from the synthesizing of all of these things

that have existed prior and the regurgitation of it.

The human soul is just deeply complex

and what we allow into ourselves and what we bring back out

is a thumbprint, so yeah.

Is the work for you more about

posing questions and challenges or

is about giving the audience sort of resolution?

Where is the fun in it for you?

In The Color Purple specifically?

Yeah, just in the work that you would create,

The Color Purple, yeah. In work.

I mean, that's a great question.

I mean, look, the culture I come from

is a very participatory culture,

so all art, there's always a place

for the audience to participate in it.

That means that there is no finite art, right?

That means that if I create a painting

and you see it when you're 10 years old,

when you're 30 years old,

you're gonna see the painting differently

because it's a living breathing thing.

Same with music.

I remember when I was young, I couldn't understand jazz.

I'm like, This is confusing, I can't find the beat.

I literally can't go a day without listening to jazz now

because Miles Davis' work is living, breathing.

Coltrane's work is living, breathing.

And I think that that's something that's very peculiar

about art in general, but specifically about

the art that I know.

All I know about storytelling

comes from my grandmother's stories.

In Ghana where I grew up at,

there was a time at which electricity was very irregular.

So at night, the only thing that we had

was my grandmother's stories.

Now, these stories were incredibly

flexible, let's put it that way

because of course she ended up being our Netflix, Hulu,

HBO all in one.

And what I realized about her idea of storytelling

was how cyclical it was.

She's never quite lenient, I mean, you know,

the protagonist would change sometimes they would be

in form of a bird, there'll be a form of a table,

they'll take the form of a human

and there was always a way in which

the moral of the story was constantly in rotation,

but the protagonists were changing and the

set of circumstances were changing and I found that

to be a really informative way

into how I get into storytelling.

So I never quite make anything

as a resolute ending.

There's everything I've done

is open to interpretation by the audience

and based on your personal set of circumstances,

what you see as truth or false,

you'll project that into the work.

And so in making certainly The Color Purple,

even when I made Black Is King with Beyonce,

it was like, all right, if somebody gets it, they do,

but if they don't, that's fine.

At some point, you know, in 10 years

you might watch it and go and go, oh, I see that, you know?

And for me, that's good art.

Good art is constantly evolving

and constantly keeping up with time.

It's less about it being universal

and more deeply personal

'cause within the personal you find the universal.

That's absolutely true.

So you mentioned a phrase earlier,

pathways for liberation.

We're coming off a sort of

historic writer strike in Hollywood.

I'm wondering if you think now

there is a better way forward

for black artists in the industry?

Nope. [audience laughing]

I mean, let's be clear, let's be honest, look,

the industry exists in a much more larger

structure that is deeply institutional, right?

And so any bias that you might find

in a microcosm comes from a macro problem.

And the reality is that the way in which

we still relate to one another

is still so deeply, deeply

separated and biased.

And so, yes, I've gotten to make a major studio picture,

by the way, as the first Ghanaian who has ever done so,

which is in, oh, no, no, let's not applaud that guys,

I mean, that's when you go, that's insane.

You know how long Ghanaians have existed?

You know how long cinema has existed?

How the hell am might the first one doing this in 2023?

And here's the bigger challenge, who do I call?

When I'm in the midst of madness

and I cannot understand studio politics,

how to relate, how to release a movie?

You know, so now I got pioneer syndrome

and I'm going, I have to literally fall every time

to learn my lesson, right?

Versus somebody else who can pick up the phone

and call Scorsese

and go, Hey, when you did 'Goodfellas,'

you know, and you got to this point,

how did you handle that? You know?

And I had Steven Spielberg,

great guy, was very helpful to me.

My set of circumstances couldn't be further away.

I'm an immigrant, first of all,

like, where do we even start talking

about what it means to be such an outsider looking in?

And so it is challenging,

you know, to be in this position,

but it's also necessary work because

I truly believe that it is incalculable

how much the world loses every day

by the intentional exclusion of African,

black, brown, indigenous creative and intellectual genius.

It's like you can't do the math on it, you know?

Like we know how great Einstein was.

You know how many Einstein's never, never, never get to

see any opportunity and are in coltan mines

and are in, you know, slave based labor today?

Like, how are we gonna advance

as a people, as a species, as a anything, right?

And so I say that to say

there's so much work to be done

and as much gratitude in my heart that I have

to have these opportunities,

boy, we have not even begun the work.

Do you feel like you have a certain responsibility

as a black artist at this position now in your career?

Oh, I don't have a choice.

I mean, listen, I would love to just show up and do art

and go home. Yeah.

How nice will that be, you know?

But I can't even fathom that.

I have to build institutions,

I run an organization in Ghana

called the Africa Film Society.

It takes up a considerable amount of my time.

I fund it fully myself.

We create outdoor screening programs

for free outdoors.

Where I'm from is a very classist society,

so anything that is great and well-funded

goes to rich kids and the average kid has no access,

there's very little public programming.

So I have to do that work

because art education is central.

I was lucky, I had a mother who allowed me to be an artist.

It's unfathomable.

I mean, I don't see any Africans in the house,

but I guarantee you if you ask them

there's like four jobs you possibly could be.

Your parents are like, you are going to be a lawyer,

a doctor, perhaps a pilot, okay?

All right and so when you come up

and you want to be an artist, what is that?

My mother, I was just very fortunate,

the house we grew up in was always under construction

for some reason,

like, there was always a room that wasn't quite done.

It was like, when are they gonna finish this house?

There's always a room somewhere

and my mother would say, You can have this room.

And I'll stay in there, that's where I learned to draw,

that's where I learned to paint,

that's where I learned to write music,

that's where I knew, you know,

and for cinema, here's the wild thing about cinema.

So there weren't many cinema houses and if there were,

my parents were not taking us.

So how I came into contact with cinema

was through the evangelicals

who came to show Jesus movies

for free in the park.

And by the way, that was Christmas.

I mean, you'll finish your chores early,

you will pack your stuff, you'll take your mats

to the soccer field and wait.

And the one movie they always showed

The Last Temptation of Jesus Christ.

And you know what?

I didn't know it was Martin Scorsese,

I didn't even know who he was.

And Paul Schrader wrote it.

And then I found out these guys

make some of the most gangster movies ever.

Goodfellas, you know, Taxi Driver.

And they made a Jesus movie

with Willem Dafoe, guys, it was wild.

And that was Jesus to me.

Now I see him and I can't believe it,

I'm like, Willem Dafoe was Jesus.

[audience laughing] Some wild casting.

But all to say, all to say

these outdoor cinematic experiences

was so fundamental to me

in terms of seeing an art form

that was so global

that was encompassing of all the arts.

'Cause to make a film, you gotta know how to write,

you gotta know how to photograph, paint, frame,

you gotta understand music and cadencing and scoring

and all these things I was doing in isolation.

I didn't know there was an art form that

could combine them all

and the feelings that I got from them

and so what I do now is

I've taken over the evangelicals

and now I go to the soccer parks

and project all kinds of movies, I mean all kinds.

And primarily African movies and African diaspora movies

because I want them to know

that there's a cinematic language that is African

and African diasporan and

all we do is add to the lexicon.

So every film I've done Burial of Kojo my first,

Black Is King, and of course The Color Purple

It's just expanding on this lexicon

and just adding slang to a language that already exists.

Speaking of that lexicon where,

and despite the conditions you described earlier

of Hollywood and sort of the black creator

trying to come up within it,

we're at a really exciting time as well.

We have creators like Nikyatu Jusu,

Terence Nance, Juel Taylor, people making really-

I was roommates with Terence Nance for five years.

[Jason laughing] Yes.

I'm so glad you mentioned these

brilliant, brilliant artists.

I know Niki, I've known Niki for years.

So amazing, but keep going.

What most excites you about this

next wave of black filmmaking

that we're seeing from these sort of young minds

that are coming out

and sort of the possibility within their art?

Well, first it's the liberation of the tools.

You know there was a time where

you couldn't fathom making a movie,

literally, because

you know, to make a movie,

it was the same way you couldn't fathom recording an album,

you know, 'cause there were like three studios

in the country that you had to go to

and, you know, cut a record.

Same way, you know, film cameras,

celluloid was so expensive

that it made it improbable and impossible

for anybody who is disenfranchised or marginalized

to participate in the art.

The liberation of the tools

and the accessibility of the tools

only makes for an incredible, incredibly diverse

and exciting medium.

So, to give you an example, music, right?

The tools of music have been liberated for a very long time.

And that we can just talk about just Africa

and African diasporan music.

Everything from jazz, blues, funk,

hip-hop, R & B, Roomba, Samba.

I mean, I can keep going on and on and on and on

because the tools are liberated and it's easy

and the bars to entry are low.

Now how about creative endeavors which

much higher bars to entry?

Well that's where it becomes very difficult because

even though I am making a film

because the tools aren't liberated

and are still quite colonized because it's like

whoever pays you to do it determines the medium

and how they would like to see it done, right?

It makes it very difficult to innovate.

And I think the medium of cinema has deeply struggled.

I mean, think about this.

When you hear music,

let's say Latin music,

you can immediately go, Yeah, that's a Latin band, right?

You hear Asian music, oh, yep, that's an Asian band.

I mean, there's sensibilities.

You notice, you watch a movie, you can't really tell,

they all just look the same, they're cut the same,

they feel the same, often from the same narrow lens.

There's not a lot of personality in the medium itself.

Now, a few auteurs were able to,

you know, I'm a big Wong Kar-wai fan,

we don't have any fans of Wong Kar-wai in the house,

oh shit, three of you, that's good.

I'm a big Kurosawa fan, Akira Kurosawa.

When you watch his film, you're looking at

Japanese sensibilities.

Where his camera goes is based on the Japanese form,

the Japanese form of engagement.

The camera is a participant, you know?

That's what I hope for the medium itself, right?

And hence because the tools are much more accessible,

people are beginning to take more chances.

Hence the Terence Nance's, the Nikyatu's,

you know, I'm part of that school

of people who can now pick up sometimes a phone,

sometimes a DSLR camera.

You know, I made my very first film in Ghana with $40,000

that I went on tour and saved every dime off of.

I was keeping my per diems, okay?

Now, I was literally spending $40,000 a day on craft service

when I made Color Purple.

So like, can you fathom that range

from like my entire budget

for my first feature film,

which by the way was Ghana's first feature film on Netflix,

thanks to, shout out to Ava DuVernay who made it possible.

And that's what Beyonce saw on Netflix and hired me.

$40,000, we were literally spending that on like,

oh, cookies a day.

So I'm saying that to say the discrepancy is so insane

and the accessibility

and my hope is that at some point

these tools will be liberated enough

that you can actually start to see a truly diverse

art form and not one that is forged

from a very narrow lens of who controls the purse strings.

I couldn't think of a better place to end.

Thank you so much, Blitz. This was an amazing conversation-

It was a pleasure, thank you guys for having me.

Go see The Color Purple.

It's coming out soon, thank you guys.

Color Purple in theaters Christmas, come on now,

you know I'm not gonna leave without shouting that out.

Color Purple in theaters Christmas Day.

Tell a friend to tell a friend, rock your purples.

It's gonna be an event, thank you so much.

"Israelis question whether the United States really understand that Hamas isn’t interested in political negotiations | Pool photo by Miriam Alster via AFP/Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.

TEL AVIV — Do Israel’s Western allies really believe that the country has the right to defend itself?

Israelis aren’t sure.

To varying degrees since the military offensive was launched against Hamas, Western allies have sought to persuade Israel to curtail the campaign, and clearly some would prefer for it to be aborted altogether.

Reeling from the shock at the sheer ISIS-like savagery of the Hamas attack on kibbutzim in southern Israel, Western allies quickly embraced Israel’s right to self-defense. But many hedged this right from the get-go with caveats — some justified — about the lack of a defining post-war end goal.

There was handwringing also about the risks of the war expanding and inflaming the whole region and worry, too, that Israel might allow its anger to push it into over-reaching.

Behind the scenes, the Biden administration was urging Benjamin Netanyahu to delay launching the offensive — a bid to run the clock, hoping the passing of time might lead Israel to scale back its military plans.

And, of course, as the death toll in Gaza climbed, the shock of October 7 wore off for many Western allies.

France’s Emmanuel Macron was the first major Western leader to call for a cessation of hostilities, making him an unsurprising outlier. But others have not been far behind, and now they hope to stretch the four-day truce for as long as possible, which would provide further time and opportunity to pile pressure on Israel to halt the military campaign for good. Or at least scale it back considerably.

Characteristically, U.S. President Joe Biden has been inconsistent, trying to have it all ways.

Two weeks ago, when asked what the chances were for a cease-fire in Gaza, Biden was in warrior mode and dismissive. “None. No possibility,” he said.

In an op-ed in the Washington Post on November 18, he wrote: “We stand firmly with the Israeli people as they defend themselves against the murderous nihilism of Hamas.” He highlighted how he’d quickly gone to Israel after October 7 to “reaffirm to the world that the United States has Israel’s back.”

“As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a cease-fire is not peace. To Hamas’s members, every cease-fire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the killing by attacking innocents again. An outcome that leaves Hamas in control of Gaza would once more perpetuate its hate and deny Palestinian civilians the chance to build something better for themselves,” he wrote.

U.S. President Joe Biden speaks as Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu listens on prior to their meeting in Tel Aviv on October 18, 2023 | Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images

But less than a week later, while in Nantucket, Massachusetts for Thanksgiving, that was all forgotten and Biden struck a different chord saying “the chances are real” that the pause could open the door to a longer cease-fire.

No worries there about how Hamas exploits every cease-fire for war preparations.

Admittedly, Biden hasn’t talked yet of a permanent cease-fire and he’s linked any truces to the release of hostages. But the change in the mood music was striking and has been noted in Israel, where there’s rising anxiety that the Biden administration is making electoral calculations swayed by progressive Democrats, Arab leaders and Europeans.

The problem with that is Hamas doesn’t really want a permanent end to hostilities, Israelis argue. Just ask Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas’ political bureau and a man some once suggested was a moderate, they say. Speaking on Lebanese television in October he applauded the slaughter of October 7 and promised that Hamas “will do this again and again.”

“There will be a second, a third, a fourth,” he added. “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country, because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nation, and must be finished,” he declared.

Israelis question whether the United States — as well as most other Western allies — really understand that Hamas isn’t interested in political negotiations about a two-state solution. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” means what it says. No Jewish state.

Politicians across the ideological spectrum in Israel are always careful to praise Biden publicly, but most are suspicious of the U.S. president, noting his inconstancy and his long-established pattern to talk grandiosely but act cautiously. And then there’s his habit of switching positions.

In fact, the quip doing the rounds in Tel Aviv is that “Biden is your best friend, until he isn’t.”

Others note the U.S. leader tends to go by his gut instincts when making decisions. “Does that mean we’re hostages to the fortunes of his digestive tract?” an aide to a member of Israel’s security cabinet remarked to me last week. He asked not to be named, not wanting to impact his boss’s relations with the White House.

While some Israelis fault Netanyahu for reaching too easily for Holocaust comparisons and of failing to define a day-after governance plan for Gaza when Hamas is no more, the one overwhelming message from most is that this time Hamas must be defeated comprehensively, and that a truncated military campaign would in effect be a win for Hamas.

Opinion polls bear that out with Israeli attitudes towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict more hawkish than at any time in recent memory. Only 24.5 percent of Israeli Jews favor peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority – a fall from 47.6 in favor in September.

In a survey conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute before the current pause, only 10 percent of Israeli Jews said they would support a pause in fighting to exchange hostages.

Meanwhile, 44 percent said they wanted the government to negotiate for the hostages’ return without any pause and 27 percent said there should be no negotiations, only fighting. And 12 percent said hostage talks should only take place when Hamas has been defeated.

Israelis do worry that international pressure will mount to such an extent that they are compelled to stop the war on Hamas far short of the war aims. A halt now or before the goal has been accomplished would be “for Yahya Sinwar [Hamas’ leader in Gaza] a victory,” says Michael Milshtein, a former head of the Department for Palestinians Affairs in Israel’s Defense Intelligence agency.

“If this war ends with Hamas’ survival, it will further weaken the PLO-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and we can kiss goodbye to any serious talks in the future about a two-state solution or a political settlement with the Palestinians. Hamas isn’t interested in a political resolution – it wants to extinguish the state of Israel,” Milshtein adds. The only question will be when the next war will begin, he and others say.

“We have to end their capability of threatening Israel ever again,” Ophir Falk, Benjamin Netanyahu’s top foreign policy adviser, told me. “This can’t be just another cycle of violence. Almost everybody in Israel is fully united. The people in the streets and the government and the cabinet and everybody understands that this is a must thing for us to do,” he added.

So, what if the pressure mounts from Western allies for a cessation of hostilities? “No, that’s not an option,” Falk told me. “We are going to destroy Hamas. And asking us for a ceasefire would be like asking for a ceasefire after 9/11 or Pearl Harbor. It’s just not going to happen,” he added.

Pretty much across the board, Israelis from all walks of life are unequivocal: There should be no let-up in the campaign to uproot Hamas from Gaza. “This isn’t Bibi’s war; it is Israel’s war,” I have been told time and again the past month.",political
"YouTube Premium’s price has increased to $13.99 a month in the US, a $2 increase compared to what it used to cost. That’s according to Google’s signup page for the service, which has been quietly updated to reflect the new pricing, as was first spotted by 9to5Google. Alongside the monthly price increase, the cost of an annual subscription to YouTube Premium is increasing by $20 to $139.99.

Google confirmed the price increase in a statement given to The Verge. “We’re updating the price for YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the US to continue delivering great service and features,” YouTube spokesperson Jessica Gibby said in a statement. “We believe this new price reflects the value of YouTube Premium which allows subscribers to enjoy ad-free YouTube with background and offline play and uninterrupted access to over 100M songs with the YouTube Music app.”

Gibby confirmed that most existing YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers will see their prices increase from the next billing cycle, and that they can expect to receive confirmation of the change via email. News of the price increase for individual subscribers follows a similar price increase for those on YouTube Premium’s family plan last October.

The price increase will also apply to legacy $9.99 YouTube Red subscribers. When Google last raised the price of ad-free YouTube as part of its rebrand from “YouTube Red” into “YouTube Premium” in 2018 it allowed former YouTube Red subscribers to continue to pay the old monthly price. Such subscribers will receive an additional three months at their current rate before the price increase applies, Gibby told The Verge.

It doesn’t sound like there are any immediate plans to increase prices by the same amount in other countries, but Google isn’t ruling it out. “We re-evaluate our pricing on an ongoing basis as conditions change in countries around the world,” YouTube’s Gibby said in a statement. “Any future price increases will be communicated first and foremost directly to existing members, providing a minimum of 30 days before any price increases take effect.”

YouTube Premium offers a collection of functionality improvements for the video streaming platform. Subscribers get to watch YouTube videos with no ads and download them to watch without an internet connection. There’s also support for background playback, letting subscribers listen to a video’s audio while using other apps or while their phone screen is off. More recently, Google updated YouTube Premium with a higher-quality 1080p steaming option on select platforms. And importantly, subscribing puts an end to Google’s incessant nagging.",technology

Ariel Muzicant is the president of the European Jewish Congress

We are witnessing a period of intense animosity toward Jewish communities in Belgium, as we are across all of Europe.

Threats — often violent — addressed to Jewish children are now a regular occurrence both online and on the streets of Antwerp and Brussels. And since the October 7 attacks in Israel, antisemitic incidents are now 10 times greater than the average recorded levels for equivalent periods.

Students at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, a couple walking along the street in Antwerp, and a cemetery in Charleroi have all been targeted over the last few weeks for one reason, and one reason alone.

All the targets were Jewish. Young Jews, old Jews — even dead Jews.

This isn’t the first time that a mass antisemitic attack — in this case, a pogrom perpetrated by Hamas in Israel, resulting in more Jews murdered than in any single 24-hour period since the Shoah — has brought not reflection and solidarity, but more hate and attacks.

We must be clear. Hate, delegitimization, antisemitic speech and the targeting of Jews — they always lead to physical attacks. The recent petrol bomb attack on a synagogue in Berlin, the entry to the home of an elderly Jewish couple being set alight in Paris, and the most shocking desecration of the Jewish cemetery in Vienna all attest to a daily atmosphere of fear for Europe’s Jews.

This is why the Jewish community here in Belgium needs your solidarity, and why a visible statement needs to go out from here — the heart of Europe — that Jews aren’t fair game or legitimate collateral damage for those wishing to express their opinions on a conflict taking place 4,000 kilometers away.

It shouldn’t need reasserting that Jewish communities are an integral part of the fabric of Belgian and European society, entitled to the same rights and protections as all citizens. Yet, this is a community that has faced huge levels of antisemitic attacks for 20 years now, the worst of which was the terrorist murders at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2014.

The statistics tell their own story — one of a society that is now no longer welcoming for Jews. Whether it be the Belgian Jews forced behind iron bars, security cameras and armed police for the “right” to attend school or pray in a synagogue, or the countless families simply voting with their feet and moving abroad, deciding that there’s no future in the country of their birth.

This is a reality that no Belgian or European politician, or indeed citizen, should accept. The safety and security of minority communities is itself a fundamental pillar of a democratic and liberal society and the right of all citizens.

This is why on December 10, the International Day of Human Rights, a national march against antisemitism will be convened on the streets of the Belgian capital, under the slogan “Never Again.” The march is organized by the Belgian League Against Antisemitism (LBCA), the Coordinating Committee of Belgian Jewish Organizations (CCOJB) and the Forum of Jewish Organisations (FJO), and it has the full support of the European Jewish Congress.

All of Belgian society, and everyone who lives and works in the EU capital, is invited to mobilize and demonstrate their support for their Jewish neighbors.

This is a call for solidarity. It is a plea that our common society be open, safe and welcoming to all, free from the horrors of intolerance, racism and antisemitism.

In the words of the European Commission: “The resurgence of antisemitic incidents across Europe, which in recent days has reached exceptionally high levels, recalls some of the darkest periods of history.”

Indeed, it does.

This is the same fight for a just and tolerant society that everyone deserves. And we cannot fight it alone. We shouldn’t have to.",political
"Harvard University president Claudine Gay apologized Thursday for her comments during a House Education committee hearing, during which she said that calling for genocide of Jews may or may not violate university rules “depending on the context.”

Gay is among several university presidents who have faced intense criticism of their response to antisemitism on campus following Hamas’ attack on Israel in October.

In her testimony earlier this week, Gay acknowledged an “alarming” rise in antisemitism at Harvard. But, when asked whether “calling for the genocide of Jews [violates] Harvard’s rules of bullying and harassment,” she responded “It can be, depending on the context,” sparking fury inside and outside the university community.",political
"Transcript

[Narrator] This is a clock, and this is a clock,

and this is a clock,

and every one of these clocks is an inventive journey.

This clock walks over 3000 miles a year.

It'll walk back and forth once a minute,

so if I put it on Interstate 80 headed west,

it would be out in San Francisco by the end of the year.

[Narrator] Meet Rick Stanley.

He makes clocks using everything from bottles,

to bicycles, dominoes, and even liquid.

Each one is completely unique and totally accurate.

Even when we're on vacation somewhere,

I think of different clocks to make.

I could not see myself doing anything other than clocks.

[upbeat music]

There's five elements of a clock:

energy, gearing, escapement, control, and indication.

Energy, this is a rock here.

We have gearing, which slows down the speed for the hands.

We have an escapement, which starts and stops the movement.

Here we have a pendulum,

which is what determines how fast the escapement is moving,

and we have a dial to read the actual time from.

This is a walking clock.

[clock ticking]

When it gets to this end here, it will hit this stop sign,

which will increment to the next minute.

All this metal here, I hand-bent and welded,

so that the bearings would be at these exact spots.

The inspiration from this clock came

from a machine that was used for testing shoes,

because everything I see is a clock.

All I have to do is figure out how to take that concept

and roll it into a clock.

This is the domino clock.

There's a small solenoid under there

that will push the domino up every minute.

On the hour, I carved my daughter's hand here.

This will push out, push all the dominoes down,

and the last one will hit the counter,

which will move over to the next hour.

[Narrator] Rick's lifelong study

of clocks puts the concept of time

into a unique perspective.

I think time has always been something

that's been important to people.

Look, even prehistoric people look at the stars.

Some people are always concerned

about they need to do this, they need to do that.

I don't. I kind of flow with the time.

[Interviewer] Do you like daylight savings time?

[Rick laughs]

No, I don't like daylight savings time.

It takes me weeks to change all the clocks back

to how they're supposed to be.

This is a bottle clock.

The motor turns one revolution a minute,

which is the second hand.

The bottles mesh with one another.

There's 12 bottles here and 24 here,

so this has to go around twice for this to go around once.

This is 30 bottles to 12, 36 bottles to 12,

and 48 bottles to 12.

That's 1/60th the speed here than it was where it started.

Then it continues on this way and drops at another 1/12th.

Opening on the bottles is not consistent.

Each bolt had to be turned to a different diameter.

This is 300 bottles, 300 bolts that we had to turn.

Each one was a different size to get this clock to be built.

This is my fluid clock.

On the hour, the minutes drain out and the hours fill.

It's the only 3D clock I know of.

Normally clocks just have a dial.

This one, whichever direction you walk at it,

you can tell the time.

There's pumps down here that provide oil for the hour

and the minute.

A small timer microprocessor turns the pumps on and off.

[gentle piano music]

I definitely have a very childlike curiosity.

I think everybody should.

When I was little,

I mean like four or five years old, I took clocks apart.

I didn't put them together,

which was a problem for my parents,

but I did try to build stuff

over the years that were interesting, solving problems.

[Narrator] As staggering as Rick's finished clocks are,

he always has something

in the works that he's never done before.

This is my prototype area where I go from creating an idea

to actually building it.

Some of these work quite well.

Some of them are still in the refinement stage.

I'll come up with different designs.

This one in particular is the timber frame clock

with the different size gears that are used on that.

Here's the chimes,

[chimes clang]

and here's detail of the escapement that we used.

[dramatic music]

This prototype, I call Time Traveler.

Every hour, one clock will come out.

This clock operates off of pneumatics,

and it has air cylinders that will extend it out.

Lift up the lid.

The timing comes off of a little microprocessor.

This is probably about eight months' work.

I'm gonna build another two more sections on this

for the full 12 hours.

Future project, these cans here will lift mannequin hands,

bringing balls up to a new elevation,

so to actually come up with the concept

usually takes less than a day.

Then it takes a couple weeks to design.

If there's electronic parts, order those,

and then it usually takes maybe eight months

to a year to actually construct the clock.

This clock uses ball bearings.

The wonderful feature about these versus a regular gear

is that you can go at different angles.

It has a motor here, which powers the second hand,

which comes through the clock.

This'll power the minute hand here,

and then it's further reduced down in speed

to power up the hour hand.

[Narrator] While clocks are Rick's main medium,

his love of invention is evident throughout his space.

This is a feather duster I made for cleaning the barn.

I know this only cleans one foot,

but I really like the unique idea

of having an arm that would clean even a small portion

of the barn.

Here we are in the cat-feteria.

This is where the cat has her feeder.

She has a chip.

It'll be sensed right here,

and it's only her that will be able to eat the food,

and it'll come down.

It'll stay down for three minutes,

and then it'll return on up.

Well, let me show you this,

my granddaughter's favorite song

is She'll Be Coming [cheerful music]

Around the Mountain.

A friend said to me,

I can't believe you'd spend all this time

for a two year old.

She's not two.

She's two and a half, and she'll correct me every time.

Now, we'll go over into the wood shop.

[upbeat music]

First thing I usually do is I will start

my music. [machinery grinding]

[gentle piano music]

This is a wonderful space I have.

It has high ceilings.

It's easy to move wood around here.

I have all the tools that I feel I need

for most of my projects.

We'll go over to the band saw here.

It's a very nice band saw built in the late 1800s.

The one problem I had was lighting,

so I built this light that lowers down

from the ceiling. [people chatting]

I'm sorry.

I built a pneumatic air cylinder that'll lower a light down

to give me the light I need.

When I'm building a clock, I will spend hours

at this band saw cutting out different pieces.

[upbeat music]

Here's another prototype I made.

It's a transformer clock.

I love transformers, where it'll take one object,

and turn it into something completely different.

I built this as a grandfather clock that will turn

into a desk, and still keep the time.

[machinery grinding]

This uses Arduino, our microprocessor,

set up that the motors will work at the proper timing.

This probably has over a thousand hours working

and reworking to get it into this state.

It's probably still six months or a year away

from becoming something that would be worth putting

in a house.

The surfaces need to be all beautiful, not how they are now.

[Narrator] Rick loves his time in his workshop,

but for him, a project isn't complete when it works.

It requires a bit more.

I'm elated when it works, but it doesn't stop there.

I need to have somebody else,

a family member or somebody that stops by,

and I like to show it to them, and say, Look at this.

What do you think?

Because I get self-gratification,

but I even get more gratification

seeing other people's faces light up.

"Finland hopes to ease restrictions on its eastern border with Russia after the traffic of migrants stopped following Helsinki’s complete closure of the frontier last week, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said.

“We are closely following the situation, how it evolves,” Valtonen told POLITICO in an interview on Friday. “And now that it has been peaceful, we hope that we can, if not go directly to normal … at least open a few border crossings if possible.”

Finland last week closed its entire eastern border with Russia for two weeks amid accusations that Moscow was encouraging asylum seekers to travel across its frontier into the EU and NATO country.

Valtonen said Finland has evidence that Russian authorities have been actively helping people reach the border, by oganizing group transports and providing people with equipment, for example, and recruiting people. “This is an active measure of instrumentalizing third-country citizens, which Finland cannot accept,” she said.

Valtonen also said recent reports that Russia planned to disrupt Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO are “very disturbing” because they show that “Russia has no respect for the sovereignty of nations.”

“When we sent in the membership application a year and a half ago to join NATO, we were prepared to tackle with all sorts of Russian influence. So apparently this threat has not gone away,” the minister said.

Earlier this week, Finnish broadcaster Yle reported that Russian intelligence services had planned to organize violent demonstrations to disrupt Sweden and Finland’s accession to NATO, including protests with the aim of causing rifts between Turkey and the EU. The report is based on a Russian intelligence memo which was originally leaked to the investigative website The Dossier Center, according to Yle.

The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) confirmed to Yle and POLITICO that it was aware of Russia’s plans to organize or encourage demonstrations in Finland, but did not give further comments. Finland joined the Western defense alliance in the spring; Sweden said last week that Turkey has promised it will ratify Stockholm’s bid “within weeks.”

Tensions between Helsinki and Moscow have escalated since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, prompting Finland to join the NATO military alliance.",political
"At this point, you cannot talk about how amazing 2023 has been for the quality of games released this year without also mentioning how it’s been utterly disastrous for the people who made them. But that’s exactly what Geoff Keighley did during this year’s Game Awards.

The numbers vary, but estimates say anywhere between six and seven thousand workers have lost their jobs just this year. No level of studio size or success has been spared. And those who have been let go are now being forced to contend for an ever-dwindling number of open job postings.

“This has been one of the most volatile periods in the games industry in the last 15 years,” said Jakin Vela, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, in an interview with Polygon.

To be clear, Geoff Keighley isn’t responsible for these layoffs, and layoffs are an unfortunate but regular part of this and many other industries. But with the platform Keighley has, he does have a duty to his audience to recognize the conditions under which the games his events celebrate are made. He’s done it before.

In that same thread, he also recognized the power and visibility of his platform.

“I also realize we have a big platform which can accelerate and inspire change,” he posted. “We are committed to that, but we all need to work together to build a better and a more inclusive environment so everyone feels safe to build the world’s best games.”

Throughout this year’s awards show, Keighley and developers spoke about the impact video games have on our culture and their radical ability to change minds and broaden perspectives. (Inasmuch as the show’s organizers would allow developers to speak before playing them off or, in one case, cutting them off entirely.) Ostensibly, The Game Awards is about celebrating video games and recognizing the achievements of the people who made them.",technology

"It appears that Beeper Mini, an easy iMessage solution for Android, was simply too good to be true — or a short-lived dream, at least. On Friday, less than a week after its launch, the app started experiencing technical issues when users were suddenly unable to send and receive blue bubble messages. The problems grew worse over the course of the day, with reports piling up on the Beeper subreddit. Several people at The Verge were unable to activate their Android phone numbers with Beeper Mini as of Friday afternoon, a clear indication that Apple has plugged up whatever holes allowed the app to operate to begin with.

Beeper Mini was the result of a comprehensive attempt to reverse engineer Apple’s messaging protocol. A 16-year-old high school student managed to successfully pull it off, and for a while, everything worked without a hitch. That effort became the basis for the new app, which requires a $2 / month subscription. Here’s what my colleague Jake wrote days ago:

Its developers figured out how to register a phone number with iMessage, send messages directly to Apple’s servers, and have messages sent back to your phone natively inside the app. It was a tricky process that involved deconstructing Apple’s messaging pipeline from start to finish. Beeper’s team had to figure out where to send the messages, what the messages needed to look like, and how to pull them back down from the cloud. The hardest part, Migicovsky said, was cracking what is essentially Apple’s padlock on the whole system: a check to see whether the connected device is a genuine Apple product.

Quinn Nelson, of Snazzy Labs, also made an excellent video that covers the technical details. The belief — or I suppose the hope — among Beeper’s developers and users was that it would be such an ordeal for Apple to block the Android app that doing so wouldn’t be worth the hassle. Apparently, it was easier than anyone expected.

This throws a huge wrench into Beeper’s plans; the company was hoping to evolve Beeper Mini into an all-in-one messaging app that would eventually wrap in RCS and SMS.

Reached for comment, Beeper CEO Eric Migicovsky did not deny that Apple has successfully blocked Beeper Mini. “If it’s Apple, then I think the biggest question is... if Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, rather than using unsecure SMS? With their announcement of RCS support, it’s clear that Apple knows they have a gaping hole here. Beeper Mini is here today and works great. Why force iPhone users back to sending unencrypted SMS when they chat with friends on Android?”",technology

"Radio has been part of Zareef Ahmad Zareef’s life since childhood. Today, he listens every morning and says it’s “a mandatory indulgence” in the evenings. A Kashmiri poet, Zareef has worked on radio as a cultural and literary commentator—he’s even written programs for children—and he says that the medium is woven into the fabric of society. “In Kashmir, it has preserved our heritage, literature, culture,” he says. “We are indebted to it in the way that it has recorded our history.”

When, starting in August 2019, the Indian government all but shut off telecommunications in Kashmir during a political crisis, Zareef relied on radio to stay on top of events.

This year marked a century since the first radio broadcast was made in India. In the age of social media, radio has endured, with hundreds of millions of people still tuning in across the country. The state broadcaster All India Radio has 262 radio stations that reach almost every part of India, broadcasting in 23 languages and 146 dialects. There are over 388 private FM stations spread across the biggest and smaller cities. But that enormous reach has one major limitation. People like Zareef who are looking for diverse news sources can’t turn to their local radio stations because the Indian government maintains a complete monopoly on radio news. Instead, they must on foreign broadcasters.

“I listened to BBC, Voice of America, and others on my radio when I wanted an alternate source of information about what’s happening to us and around the world,” Zareef says. Even though he questions the motives of international channels, he is adamant about the need to hear alternative perspectives. “Until there is criticism of an idea, it doesn’t become respectable,” he says. “Perpetuating a singular point of view is not democracy.”

With a national election approaching—and a government that has been widely accused of censoring unfavorable coverage, arresting or harassing journalists, and shutting off the internet during moments of crisis—free speech activists, journalists, and opposition politicians worry that control over radio will hand the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party a huge advantage, limiting negative coverage of its candidates and giving it a platform for its talking points.

“In the context in which we are living, which is a unipolar government, the concern is amplification,” says political journalist Anuradha Raman. “Because you’re not giving any news on private radio at all, it just amplifies the government’s voice.”

For 16 years I was doing the same kind of stuff: same Valentine’s Day, same Diwali, as if nothing else is happening in the world.

The roots of government control over India’s airways stretch back to colonial rule. In the early 1930s, the British colonial administration bought up the bankrupt Indian Broadcast Corporation, relaunching it in 1936 as All India Radio. After independence, the Indian and Pakistani governments inherited the notion that “news on radio can be very dangerous and can easily lead to the spread of rumor, more than newspapers and others, and that it needs to be absolutely controlled,” says Isabel Alonso Huacuja, a historian at Columbia University and author of Radio for Millions, a book about radio’s development in the Indian subcontinent.

Post-independence, the government even tried to control the music that went onto the airwaves. For a time, popular music from the Bollywood industry was banned in favor of more classical music. People found a way around the blockade by tuning in to Radio Ceylon, based in Sri Lanka, which found a dedicated audience in both India and Pakistan.",technology
"Since 2016, the social behemoth now known as Meta has been working to deploy end-to-end encryption in its communication apps. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even promised in 2019 that the data privacy protection would roll out by default across all of the company's chat apps. In practice, though, it was a wildly ambitious goal fraught with technical and political challenges, and Meta has only been able to move toward it in gradual, incremental steps. But this week the company is finally starting its full rollout.

“It's been a wild ride,"" says Jon Millican, a software engineer within Meta's messenger privacy team. “I suspect this is the first time that something’s been end-to-end encrypted with all of the constraints that we’re working with. It’s not just that we’re migrating people’s data, but it’s actually that we're having to fundamentally change a bunch of the assumptions that they work with when they’re using the product.”

Meta has had to stake out a position as a committed proponent of end-to-end encryption amid pressure from law enforcement and victim advocacy groups that the privacy feature—which makes data unintelligible everywhere except on the devices of the sender and recipient—limits necessary oversight and impedes crucial police investigations. Meanwhile, the company has spent the past four years, not to mention the better part of a decade, developing the technology to retrofit two massive communication platforms—Messenger and Instagram chat—such that they could still offer the features and general experience users expect under the technical constraints and usability challenges of end-to-end encryption.

“I understand that many people don't think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform—because frankly, we don't currently have a strong reputation for building privacy-protective services, and we've historically focused on tools for more open sharing,” Zuckerberg memorably wrote in his 2019 treatise. But he added that there was a clear desire from users to have access to private and secure encrypted communication services. “This is the future I hope we will help bring about,” he wrote.

Meta says that it will take some time for the rollout of full default end-to-end encryption to reach all Messenger and Instagram chat users, and the feature is still only launching for direct messages between two accounts. End-to-end encryption for group chats will continue to be opt-in for now. But these final delays have to do with gradually converting billions of accounts to run the cryptography and encrypted storage schemes that underly the effort. And while the infrastructure is new and had to be painstakingly tailored to Meta's services, the company says it built the system on the Signal Protocol and thoroughly vetted the implementation both internally and with independent experts. In the lead-up to this announcement, the company did a final round of outreach to privacy groups and cryptographers to show them the documentation and have them test the feature.

“It looks just like Messenger, except that under the hood it has really strong encryption,” says Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptographer who previewed the launch a few weeks ago. “Getting things to work on the web seems like it was the hard part, but they pulled it off.”",technology
"Four years after its debut, the Tesla Cybertruck has finally reached its first batch of customers. The truck was delivered to about a dozen people during a lavish event at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Texas, at which Elon Musk predicted the truck would usher in a new, more exciting future.

The company also provided updated details about the pricing, range, and features for the truck, much of which has changed significantly from the originally announced numbers. The rear-wheel drive version of the electric truck will start at $60,990 — up from the original price of $39,900 in 2019 — and will get 250 miles of range on a full charge. That version won’t be available until 2025.

Coming sooner — 2024, Tesla’s order page states optimistically — will be the dual-motor and tri-motor “Cyberbeast” versions. The AWD Cybertruck will start at $79,990, get 340 miles, hit 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds, and do a top speed of 112 mph. And the tri-motor trim will run you $99,990, produce a ridiculous 845 horsepower with 10,296 lb-ft of torque, and get around 320 miles of range.

During the event, Musk invited Tesla chief designer Franz Von Holzhausen to re-do the infamous, botched window strength demonstration from 2019, in which he smashed the supposed armor plated glass with a ball bearing. This time he threw a baseball — pretty weakly, I might add — but the glass withstood the projectile this time around.

The event was uncharacteristically short for a Tesla party. There appeared to be far fewer attendees than were at the original Cybertruck debut back in 2019. After Musk went through some the features, including the truck’s bulletproof exterior and some of its performance capabilities, he quickly announced it was over — and then helped about a dozen or so of the first customers drive off in their trucks.

Not mentioning the price may have been a deliberate choice, because clearly those numbers were much less attractive than the prices we saw back in 2019. That said, customers are sure to be happy with the towing and acceleration capabilities.

The angular, stainless steel electric truck has long fascinated fans of Tesla, but its many delays have led some to question whether the truck would ever actually arrive. The production has reportedly been extremely challenging for the company, mostly due to the choice to use ultra-hard stainless steel for the exterior. Musk insisted the truck be bulletproof, which further complicated the process.

The polarizing design has been another flashpoint. The polygonal shape and sharp angles were meant to signal that Tesla couldn’t be less interested in competing in the traditional truck market. That has led some experts to conclude that the Cybertruck is likely to be more of a halo vehicle for the company, luring in customers to instead buy its more practical (and available) vehicles, like the Model 3 and Y.

The angular, stainless steel electric truck has long fascinated fans of Tesla

Indeed, in the run-up to the event, Musk sought to “temper expectations” around the Cybertruck, warning investors that it wouldn’t start to generate “positive cash flow” for the company for at least a year to 18 months. Tesla has said it expects to begin producing 250,000 trucks annually by 2025, but the production ramp would be extraordinarily difficult.

In an earnings call in October, Musk said “demand was off the charts,” noting that over 1 million people have paid $100 in a refundable deposit to reserve the Cybertruck. But he also admitted that the company may have bitten off more than it could chew. “We dug our own grave with the Cybertruck,” he said. “You know, nobody — in general, probably nobody digs a grave better than themselves.”

Now that it’s out, much of the focus will redirect to Tesla’s production and how quickly the company can get these vehicles into customers’ hands. As a new entry into the highly competitive truck market, there will also be some attention paid to how well it competes with other electric trucks out there, like the Ford F-150 Lightning and Rivian R1T.

But those questions may be moot because Tesla is just not expected to make very many — at least not at first. The polarizing design is likely to turn off a broad swath of truck customers. And its arrival in the midst of a cooling market for electric vehicles means there are just way fewer early adopters and tech-obsessives who are in the market for a giant polygon on wheels — cool factor notwithstanding.

From a sales perspective, the Cybertruck could end up being a huge hit. But even so, it won’t come anywhere close to matching the volume of trucks that Ford, Chevy, and others typically sell. For Musk to jump feet first into the highly lucrative, intensely competitive truck market with a divisive design and difficult production process seems like an odd choice — even for a guy who’s become somewhat famous for odd choices.",technology
"Part of / Building for tomorrow

When most people in the US need to go somewhere, they reach for their car keys. There are plenty of reasons for this: driving is easy, it’s comfortable, and it requires very little preparation. But also, it’s hard to do anything else, and maybe the hardest of those hard things is cycling.

But plenty of people do it anyway. Whether by choice or because it’s their only option, millions of Americans bike to get where they’re going — around 50 million people in 2022 And when they do, they’re facing the very real chance they might be run down by someone driving a car who either couldn’t see them or just didn’t bother to look — which happens far too often, leading to recent cyclist death counts not seen since the 1970s.

That’s because US cycling infrastructure has a long way to go before it can catch up with European cities like Copenhagen, Denmark, the bicycle paragon where the streets reflect that cycling is the norm for most people. At least in the US, bike lanes and trails are rare in the suburbs, and in cities, they can be unevenly dispersed or frustratingly disconnected, forcing cyclists to get creative to go anywhere safely. Plenty of factors get in the way here: political or cultural opposition to the very idea of bikes; resistance to changes perceived as taking space away from cars; and neighborhoods worried about the sanctity of trees as new traffic patterns are considered.

US cycling infrastructure has a long way to go before it can catch up with European cities like Copenhagen

Even for places perceived as bike-friendly, bike lanes aren’t a given. In Portland, Oregon, a city famous for its bike culture, a newly painted bike lane is in “limbo” because the city didn’t do the proper parking studies. Local cyclists blocked the crews that went to remove it after residents protested.

The US, like most of the world, is straining under the weight of cars and their baggage. People are buying bigger, heavier vehicles, causing roads to crack and deteriorate. EVs cause less atmospheric harm, but their production is deeply problematic, and they’re too heavy for the country’s crumbling roads. Car tires still create unhealthy pollution. Even setting aside environmental, social, and structural concerns, the US’s swollen SUVs and trucks are killing people more often and more effectively, and Black people and people of color are dying at disproportionate rates.

Roads and highways are also expensive. A list of Florida Department of Transportation reports on various projects, for example, puts new construction of a two-lane urban arterial road with a four-foot bike lane at very nearly $6 million per mile. Widening it can cost even more. By contrast, the most expensive pedestrian and cyclist improvement — a two-way, 12-foot shared-use path — is listed at about $410,000. Cycling infrastructure also doesn’t cost nearly as much to maintain. In fact, it’s likely a net financial benefit instead, owing to the reduced healthcare debt of more active people.

A world with fewer cars would be plainly better for the climate, and not just because of emissions. The world’s climate is barreling toward a nightmare scenario — for some, it’s already there — and cars are still rolling off of lots and onto roads in massive numbers. More cars mean more road wear, more construction, and more emissions. And as cities tear away greenery to make way for that construction or create the components to make cars and then replace it with heat-absorbing concrete, the vicious cycle continues as people use more energy to cool businesses and homes in the ever-hotter weather.

US city planning for cyclists has evolved over the years and is gradually moving away from the dreaded “sharrows” bike lane to more considered features that can be used in different situations as space and political will and funding allow. These are some of the common alternatives: Buffered bike lanes — Like a normal striped lane, buffered lanes often have no physical barriers. They exist as two stripes that create a larger visual separation between bike lanes and car lanes, sometimes with diagonal stripes connecting them.

Car-buffered bike lanes — Instead of using simple visual indicators, city planners sometimes put bike lanes on the outside of a road, with parallel parking spaces separating them from traffic. This is generally great for protection but can also make it harder to see a cyclist before turning right.

“Car door” lanes — An inversion of the car-buffered lane that creates a potentially dangerous situation. A fast-moving cyclist can be badly injured if someone abruptly opens their door without checking behind them, either because the rider doesn’t have time to react or because they’re forced to take their chances by swerving into the traffic lane. Drivers could use the Dutch reach — that is, making a habit of opening their door with the hand farthest from it, making it easier to check over their shoulder for bikes — as a potential solution to avoid injuring a cyclist.

Cycle tracks — Another term for protected bike lanes, a cycle track is a bike lane that’s protected by a physical barrier, often a curb. These can be single-direction lanes or bidirectional.

Bike box — Bike boxes are marked boxes indicating a space for cyclists to wait ahead of where drivers are expected to stop at traffic signals. They’re often painted bright green but can occasionally be other colors. Typically, the bike lane leading up to them is also painted.

Sharrow — These are street markings intended to communicate to drivers that cyclists are allowed the use of a full roadway. They’re normally used on roads without enough space for a bike lane.

Bike boulevard — Stretches of roads, normally through neighborhoods, where traffic-calming measures are employed to keep driver speeds low, making the road safer for vulnerable road users. These often feature things like sharrows, speed humps, fewer stop signs, and traffic circles.

In spite of the dangerous relationship people in the US have with their cars, when push comes to shove, many of us still love bicycles. YouGov conducted a survey (download) 10 years ago that found that only 6 percent of people in the US never learned how to ride a bike. But even as cycling to work has become less popular since 2014, StreetLight Data found a 37 percent nationwide growth in general cycling trips in its GPS-based study from 2019 to 2021. The covid pandemic spurred a cycling boom that is still reverberating.

But as the societal response to the pandemic waned, so did that growth, and it flatlined in 2022. The numbers will go down if cycling infrastructure doesn’t keep up.

Thankfully, there are optimistic, dedicated people advocating for just that.

Well-connected urban trails: clutch for cycling transit and far too rare.

Gussying up the Midwest

Milwaukee is a mostly pleasant city for cycling, with a city-spanning paved trail stretching from the city’s north end to its south end and bike lanes waiting to carry you onward from most of its frequent exits. That’s on the east side of town. Go a couple of miles west, and your options for safe routes dwindle fast.

But things are changing after the city adopted a Complete Streets ordinance mandating road designs that facilitate all kinds of transportation, not just cars. It later announced its Vision Zero policy to eliminate traffic deaths by 2037. This year, the city became an affiliate member of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), an association of cities that share safe, equitable road design guidance with each other.

Jake Newborn, assistant director of the cycling advocate group Wisconsin Bike Fed, said that former Mayor Tom Barrett managed to get plenty of bike lanes painted, but otherwise, he was very “steady as he goes.” Simple, unprotected bike lanes may actually do more harm than good in some situations, and more needs to be done.

A poorly timed car door can be ruinous.

“It all kind of came together as a tipping point as we got those different policies — the NACTO, the Complete Streets, and the Vision Zero — all kind of falling in order and then aligning with Mayor [Cavalier] Johnson,” Newborn said.

Mayor Johnson, who became the acting mayor in 2021 when Barrett became the ambassador to Luxembourg after nearly 20 years in office, was soon officially elected. Newborn said that not only has Johnson been very supportive of active transportation initiatives but also the right people ended up in the right positions in both the Department of Public Works and the city engineer’s office — a perfect storm for getting better bike infrastructure built.

“The other factor is just the reckless driving issues from the pandemic,” Newborn said. “There was this kind of collective ‘we’re just fed up with the dangerous driving,’ and one of those solutions to reduce even the ability to recklessly drive or speed is infrastructure.”

A large, broken planter that once served as a barrier for this buffered bike lane.

Reckless driving in Milwaukee got bad enough during the pandemic that, in his first act after assuming office, Johnson declared it a public health crisis. Media has given a lot of attention to the Kia Boys — more of a TikTok car theft trend than any actual organized effort — but reckless speeding has been especially bad. Drivers also swerve into the bike lane to pass cars that aren’t speeding so often that the city has a name for it: the Milwaukee slide.

“There was this kind of collective ‘we’re just fed up with the dangerous driving’”

New approaches included a road diet for Martin Luther King Jr. Drive that shrank the four-lane road to two, with a center turn lane and outside bike lanes. Milwaukee’s 2022 Complete Streets report showed that the changes caused drivers there to slow down by 10 miles per hour from 2020 to 2022.

Newborn said specific projects like the MLK Jr. Drive road diet instead of big, statewide policies have been Bike Fed’s priority for the last few years because of the bitter bipartisan divisions in the Wisconsin legislature. Getting laws passed, he said, simply takes too much time and effort because neither side is willing to give a win to the other.

That approach helped it net a major victory when the state Department of Transportation agreed to a dramatic makeover of a state-owned trucking route called National Avenue. The proposal is unlike anything in the city: it will get raised, protected cycle tracks, raised crosswalks with extended curbs, fewer lanes, and better bus stops. The change would give cyclists a new, safer east–west corridor that connects to another nearby protected cycle track that itself is a short jog over lightly used roads to the Oak Leaf trail that extends the north–south length of the city, enabling a crucial new connector between neighborhoods.

Buffered bike lanes are nice, but nothing prevents cars from parking in them.

Cycling isn’t just for the well-off

But redesigns can leave nearby disadvantaged communities cold if they don’t feel it reflects their needs. Newborn said folks in Milwaukee’s northwest side like the change, though, even when they aren’t cyclists.

“They’re walking and they’re crossing the street, or they’re taking the bus,” Newborn said, “and they’re sick of seeing crashes and having community and family members die.”

But Newborn said bike advocates don’t try to tell the largely Black community what it should want and instead focus on making sure they’re aware of the options they have for roadway designs. And he said the city is dedicated to ensuring safer road configurations are distributed equitably, rather than just making downtown streets safer.

This cut-through gives cyclists easy, safe passage underneath a highway.

Tekisha Hobbs, board president of Bike Friendly South Dallas (BFSD), has a similar report from her advocacy work in the Black and Hispanic communities of south Dallas. Hobbs said that Dallas’ leaders are preparing to update the city’s bike master plan, and they want BFSD to help them with it.

“The way it was presented to me was that, ‘hey, we’re getting good feedback, but we’re getting feedback from a lot of middle-aged white males,’” Hobbs said, “and they wanted to know more about what brown, Black people, females, and underserved people in, for example, South Dallas [want].”

“They’re sick of seeing crashes and having community and family members die”

She said a lot of people use bicycles as their primary means of transportation because they have no other choice, and many of them come to BFSD’s We-Cycle resource center to get a refurbished bike through the Earn-a-Bike program the group offers. That program is part of how BFSD gets input from its community to present to the city — Hobbs said the group talks to people about their needs when they visit. It also takes a more active role, inviting local neighbors to speak up when the chance occurs.

“We had a session where the transportation people came in,” she said, “and it was kind of like an open house. We invited people from the community of south Dallas to ask those guys questions and give that feedback.”

Hobbs, whose advocacy work started after a fatal crash involving a friend, said the community mainly wants to be seen and to be safe. South Dallas has some bike lanes, but the “stripes are faded [and] glass is in there,” so “making sure the city maintains them on a consistent basis” is a big focus for BFSD.

A sharrow marks the pavement on this bike boulevard.

The ground floor

Winning new cycling infrastructure doesn’t just happen on its own. BFSD has only been active since 2012, and its focus is on the basics: just getting the city to maintain the few bike lanes that already exist. When asked about a project he’d really like to see come through, Newborn said Bike Fed has been pursuing a miles-long rail trail that requires negotiating with a railroad company. But Hobbs had more modest goals.

“Personally for me,” Hobbs said, “getting that safe-passing law passed in Texas.” At the moment, Texas law says drivers should pass other road users at a safe distance but leaves drivers to decide what that actually means. In 2009, Texas Governor Rick Perry vetoed a law that would have required drivers to give a three-foot berth when passing cyclists because, he wrote in the proclamation, it would have put the onus of responsibility on drivers to ensure vulnerable road users’ safety.

Hobbs doesn’t pin the lack of bike infrastructure in south Dallas on the city. On the contrary, she said, “They seem to be really, really open to any recommendations or any feedback that we have.”

Hobbs described “the Loop” — a name given to a series of 11 trails intended to “connect Dallas to Dallas” by forming an unbroken, 50-mile circuit around the city center. When it’s finished, the project will connect to five of the city’s DART commuter rail stations. One leg of the Loop that runs alongside the Trinity River on Dallas’ southwest side connects to the DFW Discovery Trail, a 66-mile paved path under development that would connect Dallas to Fort Worth, passing through several of the mid-cities on its way.

Raised, off-road cycle tracks are the next best thing to trails.

The good infrastructure

The trail network Hobbs described to me is a far cry from the metroplex I knew growing up — I rode my bike in Dallas a lot but always on neighborhood streets and never for transportation outside of going to nearby friends’ houses because doing so was undeniably life-threatening (and still largely is).

After leaving for Austin in my mid-20s, I watched from afar as my hometown slowly became more bike-friendly over the past decade. Neither city is on top of its game yet — PeopleForBikes ranks Fort Worth and Dallas 153rd and 147th in the state on its 2023 list of best cities for cycling, respectively — but their progress has still been impressive.

Another smaller place has done remarkable things, though, and it’s not technically a city at all. The number two Texas location on PeopleForBikes’ list is The Woodlands, which sits nearly 30 miles north of Houston and is home to over 100,000 people. It’s both a census-designated place and a special-purpose district.

Winning new cycling infrastructure doesn’t just happen on its own

The Woodlands’ governmental structure is… unusual. It’s administered by a board of directors and a CEO inside a company called The Woodlands Township. Texas oil magnate George P. Mitchell created the planned community in 1974 to “entice city slickers looking for far-flung suburban quality of life,” according to the Houston Business Journal.

Patricia Kievlan, a board member of the Bike the Woodlands Coalition, said, “Mitchell had this vision to create this new model of suburban development that was really working in harmony with nature.”

“The plan from the beginning was that there was going to be a network of what they used to call the hike and bike trails which are now called the pathways,” she said, “and so we’ve got this extensive pathway system that’s nestled and winding within the forest and that lines every street,” said Kievlan.

The result is that The Woodlands is a very pedestrian-friendly community. But the district has had trouble getting new bike infrastructure put in place on the roads because of its strange qualities as a community.

The Woodlands, Kievlan said, has had a bike master plan in place for years, but for a long time, it couldn’t get them funded. That’s because most grants are written in such a way that only cities can use them — and The Woodlands isn’t a city. Then, when it tried for rural-area grants, the community found that because it already had such good cycling infrastructure, it couldn’t get those grants, either.

Here’s that underpass again — I just like this bird!

After the covid pandemic hit, the same trouble prevented the district from getting funding, so the community drew up a 2021 ballot measure to incorporate as a city. But around 65 percent of the district’s population rejected the measure, firmly putting to bed the idea that its cycling infrastructure goals could count on government funding. Still, Kievlan said, removing that ambiguity helped.

“Some of the people who were like, ‘Well maybe let’s not take action on things because we might become a city at some point’ [decided to] move forward with some of these things we were kind of holding off on because our form of government might have changed,” Kievlan said.

Fortunately, the coalition found the COO of the township, Chris Nunes, was very open to their ideas, according to Kievlan. She said the group is in constant email contact with him and works from a list of projects, from The Woodlands bike plan, that are tracked in a living document.

Over the last several years, Kievlan said, “the Township has budgeted about $9.3 million toward infrastructure improvements that included new pathways to fill in gaps.” And she said the board has budgeted around a million more for next year.

It’s deeply weird that The Woodlands is led by, essentially, a company. Yes, the lack of regulatory tape helps it move more nimbly than an ordinary city, but it has inherent weaknesses, too. Kievlan said that the township can and does do a lot with its plentiful bike trails, but only its bike trails.

“They are not in charge of the roads,” she said, “the roads are controlled by the counties.” They can work with the counties to enact change, but they don’t have much recourse if the county doesn’t want to do something.

Two-way cycle tracks like this make for pleasant city riding.

Looking ahead

Kievlan’s childhood hints at one possible future for US cities: “I think that’s one of the things that I like about living here. Having grown up here and experienced what it’s like to be a kid who biked to school every day in fifth and sixth grade. I was a kid bike commuter.”

She added, “It was safe, and there was a crossing guard, and there were pathways … that’s an idyllic kind of childhood, and I’m excited for my kid to have that childhood.”

The three communities represented three distinct phases of cycling advocacy, different priorities, and different approaches. Surprisingly, all of them felt local politicians were eager to know what they want when it comes to cycling infrastructure and safer pedestrian affordances — and enthusiastic about making those things real.

For Milwaukee, the challenges were complacency and timing, while the south Dallas community has just needed a voice speaking for it. In The Woodlands, a wholehearted willingness to make the roads safer ran into the peculiarities of its origins and unusual makeup.

In all cases, funding is unsurprisingly a challenge all around. But the work of creating cycling infrastructure has clear returns, both in terms of public health and the financial vibrance of a community.",technology
"Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI, the company announced on Friday.

“Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities,” the company said in its blog post. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.”

Chief technology officer Mira Murati will be the interim CEO, effective immediately. The company will be conducting a search for a permanent CEO successor. When contacted by The Verge, OpenAI’s communications department declined to comment beyond the blog post. Employees at OpenAI found out about the news when it was announced publicly, according to multiple sources.

“I loved my time at OpenAI,” Altman said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “It was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit.” In a follow-up post, he described the experience of his firing as “sorta like reading your own eulogy while you’re still alive.”

OpenAI’s announcement also said that co-founder and president Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chair of the board but remain at the company. Hours after it was published, Brockman posted to X that he had quit “based on today’s news.”

Later, in another post on X, Brockman said he and Altman were both notified of their removal from the board on Friday by OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who is also a board member. “Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,” Brockman wrote.

This is an extremely sudden turn of events. Altman has been the face of OpenAI, which kick-started the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely popular release of ChatGPT. Just last week, Altman led the keynote at the company’s first-ever DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. More recently, Altman spoke at Thursday’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.

Microsoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a similar statement on X.

Altman is a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla. He has since founded his own AI company, xAI.

Unlike traditional private company boards, OpenAI’s board consists mostly of outsiders. After the departures of Altman and Brockman, its remaining board members are the company’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever; Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo; Tasha McCauley, the former CEO of GeoSim Systems; and Helen Toner, the director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.

"The court took the case in June amid intense scrutiny of some conservative justices’ relationships with billionaires who use their fortunes to advance political agendas focused on lowering taxes and reining in the role of the federal government.

But on Tuesday, the justices repeatedly questioned the distinctions a lawyer for the taxpayers, Andrew Grossman, attempted to draw between the repatriation tax and other taxes that have long been on the books.

“Why is this any different?” Justice Elena Kagan asked. “There’s a long, century-old history of these kinds of taxes.”

However, some GOP-appointed justices — particularly Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito — seemed wary of an unalloyed victory for the government and appeared to be pushing for an outcome that would preserve latitude for the court to limit federal taxing powers in a future case.

Gorsuch told Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar that the government’s arguments seemed to allow federal authorities to declare almost anything to be income and tax it.

“I’m just asking what the limits of your argument are, and it seems to me there are none,” he said, saying that was a “big door” he was unwilling to leave open.

“That door is already open,” Prelogar responded, citing a series of Supreme Court precedents giving the federal government broad authority to tax various kinds of investments.

By the end of the two-hour-long argument session, the justices seemed to be leaning toward a narrow ruling for the government, with Gorsuch repeatedly asking Prelogar how they might craft a decision in her favor that puts aside some of the thornier issues raised by the case.

Earlier this year, Alito took the unusual step of publicly rejecting calls for him to step aside from the tax case because of his ties to one of the lawyers representing the Washington couple.

The lawyer, David Rivkin, interviewed Alito on a couple of occasions earlier this year for the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page. In a four-page statement released in September, Alito turned down calls from Democratic lawmakers for him to recuse based on the interviews and his relationship with Rivkin.

Rivkin did not argue the case Tuesday, leaving that task to Grossman. Both are partners at Ohio-based law firm BakerHostetler. Rivkin was on hand and sat quietly at the far end of the table assigned to counsel for the taxpayers.

At one point, Alito seemed to go out of his way to emphasize that he was seeking to deal fairly with the arguments presented by both sides. He was also the only justice to allude to news reports about the case, which have generally focused on its potential to act as a preemptive strike against a future wealth tax.

“One of the arguments that you press most strongly, and certainly it has resonated a lot in the coverage of this case, is that the adoption of the petitioners’ arguments would have far-reaching consequences,” Alito said to Prelogar. “So, do you think it is fair then to explore what the consequences of your argument would be?”

The court doesn’t take many tax cases, and even fewer like this one that raise questions of what counts as income.

The couple, Charles and Kathleen Moore, complain the repatriation tax triggered a $15,000 tax bill on an investment in an Indian power tool company on which they never received any income. They say the company plowed all of its earnings back into its operations. That makes the repatriation tax a levy on property, not income, they argue, and federal property taxes are effectively banned by the Constitution.

If the court were to throw out the repatriation tax, big companies could receive billions in tax refunds, perhaps with interest. And a broad ruling could also preempt any possibility of Congress adopting wealth tax proposals pushed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other progressives. Backed by a phalanx of conservative groups, the Moores had asked the court to specifically take up the case to foreclose the possibility of a wealth tax.

At the same time, tax watchers are concerned the justices — who are no experts in the arcana of taxation — could inadvertently blow big holes in the code if they don’t tread carefully. These observers point to a number of long-standing provisions in the code that tax people before they actually receive income, typically in the name of trying to prevent people from dodging the IRS. Many have warned that a sweeping ruling against taxes on “unrealized gains” could throw into legal doubt scads of other sections of the code.

The government pressed on those concerns Tuesday, pointing to a long history of taxes going back to the inauguration of the income tax. Prelogar said it’s difficult to draw lines between those provisions and the repatriation tax. A ruling for the Moores would create havoc, she argued.

“It would cause a sea change in the operation of the tax code and cost trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue,” she said.

Alito noted that the tax in question covers income dating back 30 years, and he questioned whether at some point a tax purportedly on income might functionally be one on wealth.

“Let’s say somebody graduates from school and starts up a little business in his garage, and 20 years later, 30 years later, that person is a billionaire,” Alito said. “Under your argument, can Congress tax all of that on the ground that is income?”

Prelogar called that a “harder question,” adding, “We don’t have the same tradition to support Congress levying income taxes in that manner.”

Among the court’s six Republican appointees, Justice Brett Kavanaugh sounded the most untroubled by the government’s position in the case. He dismissed some of his colleagues’ concerns about a broad-based wealth tax as ungrounded in political reality.

“On the proverbial open door … members of Congress want to get reelected,” Kavanaugh said, triggering laughter in the courtroom. “Some of the hypos — that’s why they’re far-fetched.”

A ruling in the case is expected by late June.",political
"Google just launched its Gemini AI model. Want to try it out for free? A version of the model, called Gemini Pro, is available inside of the Bard chatbot right now. Also, anyone with a Pixel 8 Pro can use a version of Gemini in their AI-suggested text replies with WhatsApp now, and with Gboard in the future.

Only a sliver of Gemini is currently available. Future releases are expected to include multimodal capabilities, where a chatbot processes multiple forms of input and produces outputs in different ways. Just the text-based version has been added to Bard.

Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis Says Gemini Is a New Breed of AI Google’s new AI model Gemini launched today inside the Bard chatbot. It could go on to advance robotics and other projects, says Demis Hassabis, the AI executive leading the project.

Gemini is also only available in English, though Google plans to roll out support for other languages soon. As with previous generative AI updates from Google, Gemini is also not available in the European Union—for now.

Despite the premium-sounding name, the Gemini Pro update for Bard is free to use. With ChatGPT, you can access the older AI models for free as well, but you pay a monthly subscription to access the most recent model, GPT-4. Details on future plans for Gemini remain scarce. Google teased that its further improved model, Gemini Ultra, may arrive in 2024, and could initially be available inside an upgraded chatbot called Bard Advanced. No subscription plan has been announced yet, but for comparison, a monthly subscription to ChatGPT Plus with GPT-4 costs $20.

How to Access Google’s Gemini Pro

Do you already have a Google account? Using Gemini inside of Bard is as simple as visiting the website in your browser and logging in. Google does not allow access to Bard if you are not willing to create an account. Users of Google Workspace accounts may need to switch over to their personal email account to try Gemini.

Remember that all of this is technically an experiment for now, and you might see some software glitches in your chatbot responses. One of the current strengths of Bard is its integration with other Google services, when it actually works. Tag @Gmail in your prompt, for example, to have the chatbot summarize your daily messages, or tag @YouTube to explore topics with videos. Our previous tests of the Bard chatbot showed potential for these integrations, but there are still plenty of kinks to be worked out.

So how is the anticipated Gemini Ultra different from the currently available Gemini Pro model? According to Google, Ultra is its “most capable mode” and is designed to handle complex tasks across text, images, audio, video, and code. The smaller version of the AI model, fitted to work as part of smartphone features, is called Gemini Nano, and it’s available now in the Pixel 8 Pro for WhatsApp replies.

As you experiment with Gemini Pro in Bard, keep in mind the things you likely already know about chatbots, such as their reputation for lying. Not sure where to even start with your prompts? Check out our guide to crafting better prompts for Google’s Bard.",technology
"Around dinner time one night in July, a student in Albuquerque, New Mexico, googled “suicide prevention hotline.” They were automatically blocked. The student tried again, using their Albuquerque Public Schools district–issued laptop to search for ""contact methods for suicide."" Blocked. They were turned away again a few hours later when attempting to access a webpage on the federally-funded Suicide Prevention Resource Center. More than a dozen times that night, the student tried to access online mental health resources, and the district's web filter blocked their requests for help every time.

In the following weeks, students and staff across Albuquerque tried and failed to reach crisis mental health resources on district computers. An eighth grader googled “suicide hotline” on their take-home laptop, a ninth grader looked up “suicide hotline number,” a high school counselor googled “who is a mandated reporter for suicide in New Mexico,” and another counselor at an elementary school tried to download a PDF of the district’s suicide prevention protocol. Blocked, blocked, blocked—all in a state with among the highest suicide rates in the US.

“It’s just like another form of oppression.” Brooklynn Chavez, student

Thanks in large part to a two-decade-old federal anti-porn law, school districts across the US restrict what students see online using a patchwork of commercial web filters that block vast and often random swathes of the internet. Companies like GoGuardian and Blocksi—the two filters used in Albuquerque—govern students’ internet use in thousands of US school districts. As the national debate over school censorship focuses on controversial book-banning laws, a WIRED investigation reveals how these automated web filters can perpetuate dangerous censorship on an even greater scale.

WIRED requested internet censorship records from 17 public school districts around the US, painting a picture of the widespread digital censorship taking place across the country. Our investigation focuses on Albuquerque Public Schools (APS), one of the largest school districts in the US, which provided the most complete look at its web-filtering systems. APS shared 36 gigabytes of district network logs covering January 2022 to August 21, 2023, offering an unprecedented look at the kinds of content blocked by US schools on a daily basis. Our analysis of more than 117 million censorship records confirms what students and civil rights advocates have long warned: Web filters are preventing kids from finding critical information about their health, identity, and the subjects they’re studying in class.

“It’s just like another form of oppression,” Brooklynn Chavez, a senior at La Cueva High School in northeast Albuquerque, says of the district’s filters. “It’s like an awful kind of feeling.”

It’s a problem that’s not going away. This summer, APS installed Blocksi web filters on all student and staff devices. According to our analysis and interviews with APS staff, the results seemed to be disastrous. During the nearly three months APS used the Blocksi filter, it blocked more than a million network requests a day, on average, including searches for mental and physical health services; words related to LGBTQ+, Black, and Hispanic communities; websites for local youth groups; thousands of student searches for harmless information; and tens of thousands of news articles.

“It will basically shut down your internet,” Shellmarie Harris, director of educational technology at APS, says of Blocksi’s keyword filtering technology. “Kids, teachers will not be able to get into anything.”",technology
"“The Finals is a game show at heart; it’s not a battle royale or a military sim.”

That’s Gustav Tilleby, creative director of The Finals, describing a new shooter from former Battlefield developers that’s launching today — a surprise shadow drop during The Game Awards. Tilleby and the team at Embark Studios have spent nearly five years painstakingly developing server-side destruction to create something truly unique. The entire environment is destructible, making The Finals feel like a first-person shooter like no other.

In The Finals, you play in teams of three, competing in a game show-like arena where you’ll collect cash and bank it to win. There are three different classes (light, medium, and heavy), all with different weapons and abilities. That all sounds like your typical arena shooter. But what sets The Finals apart is the ability to crash through buildings, blow things up with canisters, and witness UFO invasions, orbital lasers, or ramped-up destruction modes mid-game.

After playing the open beta alongside 7.5 million others, I haven’t been this excited about a first-person shooter since I played the early versions of PUBG. The Finals has the potential to shake up a formula that has gotten stale, and perhaps even boring, in recent years.

“From the very beginning, we said that if we’re going to make a shooter, it needs to be different; it needs to be something that nobody else is doing,” says Tilleby in an interview with The Verge. “I personally love systemic game design where you give the players tools and it’s really up to them to use them.”

A fully destructive world means the tactics of a usual shooter like lanes and choke points go out the window. You can be standing in a hallway in The Finals waiting for an enemy, and then, the next minute, the floor underneath you is disappearing. You can be great at aiming, but in The Finals, you need to be great at adapting and using the environment to your advantage.

“It’s almost a childhood fantasy of mine where you can play in a game where you can go into every single building, every single room, and pick up every object and destroy everything,” says Tilleby. “It’s really cool that we actually managed to build it. It’s not been easy to do.”

Destructive chaos is the name of The Finals game. Image: Embark Studios

Server-side movement is the key component of the destruction inside The Finals. In typical shooters, the elements that move inside the game and the physics engines all run on your console or PC, with movement syncing up to a server to be distributed to other players so everyone is experiencing the same multiplayer interactions. There’s always the chance here of desync, where the server and client hitboxes aren’t fully in sync and you end up with situations where you thought your aim was perfect but the bullets didn’t register.

Embark Studios decided to shift all of this onto the server. That doesn’t mean you’re streaming a cloud game; it just means the movement, destruction, and physics engines don’t run on your PC or console at all. Instead, it’s all part of network data, so moving platforms, debris piles, and all in-game movement syncs that way instead.

“So the way our model works is that as much as possible, where we can, we sort of cheat a little,” admitted Arvid Burstrom, technical animator at Embark Studios, in a podcast earlier this year. “We run this thin prediction wrapper on top of our gameplay and then we try and minimize the amount of prediction we have as much as possible so we can stay true to what the server is saying.”

It has taken years of testing and tweaking to perfect the prediction model, and even the movement in a beta earlier this year felt a little too floaty. In the early days of testing in 2021, the team discovered a series of amusing bugs, including buildings that would multiply and then collapse on top of each other and walls that had a mind of their own. Many of the object interactions and destruction elements you see in the game today were first built years ago but have been improved to the point where everyone gets to experience them now.

All of this focus on destruction has also changed how the team designs maps. “Working on other projects before, you can easily hide things or have things as backdrops because you know people will never be able to go there. Now, we can’t just create this empty space because we know people will be able to destroy it,” explains Joakim Stigsson, a senior environment artist for The Finals, in an interview with The Verge.

That has meant designing around structural integrity, considering the amount of beams, pillars, and other elements of a building that players can use to weaken a building and ultimately destroy it.

“We play test our game more or less every day,” says Stigsson. “When we’re designing the map, together with the level designers, we are playing and iterating on the maps to see if it hits the design goals we set out at the beginning.”

One of those goals was to vary the maps that are available in The Finals. “A huge addition for launch is Las Vegas,” reveals Tilleby. “It’s a bit different from the ones we’ve done so far. It has really big interconnected interiors, and it’s even leaning even more into destruction and that type of gameplay.”

The Las Vegas map even has a UFO invasion event that can appear mid-game, similar to the modifiers that suddenly appear to kick off a low-gravity mode or even more destruction damage. The alien invasion mode will include a flying saucer that can tractor beam the map and pull stuff up into the air to create an even more chaotic environment for players to fight in.

You can imagine the team will add more of these events in the future. “There are tons of ideas of where to take it next. Wind systems and weather are definitely things that are on the drawing board and that we might do sometime in the future,” says Tilleby. “I personally want to expand on features that can create knock-on effects and chain effects and so on; that’s something that would be very interesting and expand on the experience of playing the game.”

Early work on the destruction elements of The Finals.

If you played last month’s open beta, there are some new abilities to play with today. There’s a new vanishing bomb, which sounds like it’s going to be very useful for stealth play. “It’s similar to the stealth ability, but it affects all players that are in a given range so you can vanish your whole team for a short while and reposition,” says Tilleby. Throwing knives are also now part of the game, giving you some options for a ranged attack.

The first season of The Finals kicks off today, with a 12-level battle pass that includes 96 rewards. You’ll need to unlock the competitive side of the game, and the entire battle pass should take around 40 hours to complete for the average player.

The Finals is undoubtedly an exciting release for first-person shooter fans, but it now has to live up to the hype and perform the delicate balancing act of being a free-to-play live-service game. These types of games are difficult for studios to maintain, as we’ve seen recently from Destiny 2 developer Bungie.

The delicate balance involves keeping the game fresh with regular updates, a solid progression system, player rewards, and how and when paid cosmetics are available. On top of all of that, there’s the constant cat-and-mouse game against cheaters or the first-person shooter debate about cross-play, skill-based matchmaking, and how much aim assist to give console players. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a lot.

The Finals is launching on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC (Steam), with cross-play only enabled if you actively choose to. That allows console and PC players to avoid each other and spare most of the arguments about cross-play. Mouse and keyboard players will likely have an advantage in The Finals anyway simply because there’s a lot riding on your ability to respond quickly to environment changes and movement.

The matchmaking in The Finals should be a little bit more relaxed than something like Call of Duty simply because the skill gap will be different than who can hit their headshots. There are so many more variables here with the environment, player abilities, and movement that the best players will be the ones who can master the chaos and adapt. “We’ve seen that in our internal play tests; it’s not necessarily the people who are best at aiming that come out on top,” says Stigsson. “I’m not the best player in the house, but I’ve managed to win tournaments internally in testing.”",technology
"After being recalled last year for not meeting product safety standards, Tesla’s $1,900 Cyberquad for Kids is once again available to purchase on the Tesla webstore in the US. The latest release of the Cybertruck-inspired ride-on toy — identified as Model 915 — is an updated version of the Model 914 Cyberquad for Kids that launched back in December 2021. Orders for the Model 915 are expected to begin shipping in late November.

Like the Model 914, the new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids was jointly created by Tesla and popular children’s toy maker Radio Flyer, best known as the makers of the Little Red Wagon. The battery-powered Cyberquad for Kids has a 500W motor with a top speed of 10 mph (that parents can switch to 5 mph) and a max range of 15 miles, with LED headlights and taillights. Much like its Cybertruck inspiration, this pint-sized version of the Cyberquad ATV for adults also features a steel frame and high-pressure rubber air tires.

The new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids has been updated with a new suspension and safety labels to comply with CPSC rules. Image: Tesla

The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a recall for the original Model 914 in October 2022 after determining that it was better classified as a youth ATV rather than a ride-on toy. The Cyberquad for Kids failed to meet the federal mandatory safety standard requirements for youth ATVs at that time, which are fairly extensive owing to the high risk of injury ATVs present.",technology
"NotebookLM, Google’s experimental AI-powered note-taking app, is now widely available in the US. It’s also getting several new features and is “starting” to use Google’s Gemini Pro AI model “to help with document understanding and reasoning,” according to the company.

NotebookLM can already do things like summarize the documents you import into the app, come up with key points, and even answer questions about your note-taking sources. But now, Google is adding a way to transform your notes into other types of documents, too. Once you select all the notes you want to include, NotebookLM will automatically suggest formats, such as an outline or study guide. However, Google notes that you can also tell NotebookLM to transform your notes into a format of your choosing, like an email, script outline, newsletter, and more.

Here’s how NotebookLM might turn a group of notes into an outline. GIF: Google

Additionally, NotebookLM will now start providing suggested actions based on what you’re doing in the app. As an example, Google says if you’re writing a note, NotebookLM may automatically “offer tools to polish or refine your prose, or suggest related ideas from your sources based on what you’ve just written.” Some other handy features coming to the app include a way to save helpful responses from NotebookLM as notes, share your notes with others, and focus NotebookLM’s AI on select sources when chatting with it.",technology
"The scathing and salacious federal indictment against Hunter Biden on tax evasion charges has provided a boost to House Republicans at a critical time in their impeachment inquiry against President Biden, spotlighting the kind of wrongdoing by his son that they have repeatedly tried and failed to connect to the president himself.

Republicans immediately hailed the indictment — with descriptions of payments to “various women,” stays at deluxe hotels, a membership at a “sex club” and at least one Lamborghini rental written off as business expenses in a “scheme” to dodge a $1 million tax bill — as a validation of their inquiry. The charges, they said, would never have been brought without the testimony of two I.R.S. agents who have become congressional whistle-blowers and blew up a “sweetheart” plea deal between Hunter Biden and prosecutors.

Yet in the most critical respect, the indictment is far from helpful to the Republicans: It never mentions President Biden, not even indirectly, and provides no evidence linking the misdeeds of the son to the father.

Republicans have a steep challenge to build a bridge from Hunter Biden’s vices to their allegations that his father has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and to show that their impeachment inquiry is anything other than retribution for the impeachments and indictments of former President Donald J. Trump.",political
"Video doorbells are among the best smart home devices. With just a camera, speaker, microphone and a Wi-Fi connection, they turn the humble doorbell into a live, Full HD intercom accessible from anywhere in the world.

Many also have infrared-powered night vision, a cloud storage service and the ability to act as a security camera, while some even employ artificial intelligence to more reliably spot the difference between a human and other movement.

Generally speaking, there are two types of smart video doorbells to consider. Battery-powered models are the simplest to install and usually require no professional skills or specialist equipment.

Then there are wired video doorbells, which have the same smart features but are powered by the wiring from your existing, non-smart doorbell. These sometimes require professional installation, but in many cases an amateur DIYer with a working knowledge of domestic wiring can complete the job themselves.

Some video doorbells, like the Ring Elite, are powered by Ethernet, and because it’s unlikely that your home already has such a cable next to the front door, installation will likely require a professional.

Naturally, every model from every brand has its own specific set of installation instructions, but if you're looking for a general idea of how to install a smart video doorbell, we've laid it all out for you below.

Step by step for installing a battery video doorbell

Since they are battery-powered and connect to the internet with Wi-Fi, these are by far the simplest video doorbells to install. They also usually come with all of the relevant screws, wall plugs/anchors and brackets needed to fit them to a wall or door frame.

Let’s take the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus as an example. Included in the box are screws and wall plugs for mounting to both wood and brickwork, plus an optional mounting plate that adjusts the angle of the doorbell. There’s also wiring for connecting to an existing chime, and a pair of security screws for locking the doorbell closed, plus a special screwdriver for said screws.

That’s a generous amount of included kit, but you’ll also need a drill, a spirit level and a screwdriver of your own to complete the installation.

1. Charge the battery Some batteries only come partially charged so you may need to fully-charge that battery first before anything else. Once your battery is charged, slot that into the device.

2. Pair with the app Usually, manufacturers ask that you pair the smart video doorbell with their app first so make sure to download the appropriate app and follow the instructions for pairing. Follow the steps to connect the doorbell to your Wi-Fi network. As long as the doorbell can comfortably connect to your network (you might need to install a signal booster if not), then you’re good to go.

3. Install the doorbell Anyone with even a very limited amount of DIY skill should be able to install a wireless doorbell. All you need to do is drill four small holes into the wall, using the screw holes in the provided template, or if you have a Ring smart video doorbell, in the frame of the doorbell itself as your template. Then use the included wall anchors and screws to fix the frame into place.

4. Secure the faceplate Once the doorbell is secured, add the faceplate, if there's one. With a Ring video doorbell, the whole thing locked closed with a security screw designed to deter thieves, since it can’t be undone with a regular screwdriver. Make sure you keep the compatible screwdriver safe though, as you’ll need to remove this screw every few months to take out the battery and charge it.

Step by step for installing a wired video doorbell

Household electrics can be intimidating, but the most important thing to know with doorbells is that they use low-voltage wiring. This removes the dangers associated with high-voltage wiring like that used by wall outlets, and means amateurs with only basic DIY knowledge should manage without hiring a professional.

(Image credit: Future)

1. Check compatibility Your first job is to make sure your new video doorbell is compatible with the transformer used to power your home’s existing doorbell and chime. Using the Ring Video Doorbell Wired as an example, the company says a transformer meeting these specs – 8 to 24 VAC, 50/60Hz, 8VA to 40VA – is what’s needed. Do not attempt to fit a video doorbell to an incompatible transformer, as this can cause damage and electric shock. Ask a professional if you think you need to buy a replacement transformer.

2. Turn off the fuse (Image: © Future) Next, locate the fuse box and either disable the fuse responsible for powering your old doorbell and chime, or if you aren’t sure which that is, flick the master switch to turn off every fuse. Your home’s power is now disabled (try a light switch to be certain) and the wiring is safe to work on.

3. Connect it your existing doorbell chime We can’t write a guide covering the installation of every type of video doorbell. But, generally speaking, the next step is to use the bypass cable included with the new doorbell. This attaches to your doorbell chime and uses its power supply to feed the video doorbell instead. Your new video doorbell won’t work with the old chime, but it will use its power supply.

4. Carefully follow the next instructions Carefully follow the instructions included with your video doorbell. These will differ between the various makes and models available, but you should always take your time, read the instructions carefully, avoid working on any high voltage cables (they will be marked as such) and seek help from a professional electrician if you get stuck.

5. Remove your old doorbell With the bypass cable installed, it’s time to put the cover back on your chime and remove the old doorbell. This should just be a case of removing a couple of screws, gently pulling the doorbell from the wall and disconnecting a pair of wires from behind. Be careful not to let these wires disappear into the wall cavity, as they'll be used to power the smart doorbell later.

6. Install your new video doorbell The rest of the installation is just like that of a wireless video doorbell. Mark out where the screws need to go (you can use the screw holes in the doorbell itself as a template), drill into the wall and insert the wall anchors. Now connect the wires to the rear of the doorbell as per the manufacturer instructions, and screw the device into place.

7. Finish the setup Finally, turn the power back on at the fuse box, wait for your Wi-Fi router to reconnect, and go through the video doorbell’s setup process.

FAQs

Can Ring doorbell use existing doorbell wiring? Yes, most Ring doorbells can be powered by your existing wiring and they come with everything you'll need to connect them. This includes the wireless models, which can be powered either by their included rechargeable battery, or by your existing doorbell wiring. There are some exceptions, however. The Ring Video Doorbell Elite is powered by Ethernet cable, while the Video Doorbell Pro 2 can be powered by a wall socket or the existing wiring. The Ring Door View Cam fits into the peephole of your door and can only be powered by its included rechargeable battery.

What power does Ring doorbell require? If you choose not to power your Ring doorbell with a battery or wall socket, you'll need to connect it to your property's existing doorbell wiring. The first thing to do is check that the transformer powering your doorbell chime meets these specifications: 8 to 24 VAC, 50/60Hz, 8VA to 40VA. If it does, then the transformer can be used to power the video doorbell. This means that your chime will no longer function, as the power previously feeding that is now redirected to the Ring. If your transformer is not suitable, speak to an electrician about fitting a replacement.

Will my chime work with a Ring doorbell? No. The transformer powering your existing doorbell chime can be used to power the Ring video doorbell, but when a visitor presses the Ring's button your chime will not function. Instead, a press of the Ring button fires a notification to your smartphone (and the phones of anyone else logged into your Ring account). Ring doorbells can also send an alert to Alexa smart speakers and displays, so you can have the Amazon assistant announce ""someone is at the door"" or whatever custom message you like. Lastly, Ring sells a chime (imaginatively called Chime), which plugs into a wall outlet and can be set to play a range of sounds when a visitor presses the button.

Final thoughts

Installing a wireless video doorbell is no different to fitting other home security devices. So long as you have a drill and a screwdriver, and are familiar with using wall plugs/anchors, then you’re good to go.

Just make sure you take your time with measuring and ensuring the doorbell is mounted perfectly straight (if you don’t have a spirit level there are plenty of smartphone apps that do the same job). Also ensure the doorbell has a solid Wi-Fi connection, and remember to locate the doorbell in a way that the camera doesn’t invade the privacy of your neighbors.

Wired video doorbells are trickier. The installation will depend on your DIY skills and familiarity with domestic wiring, but also on the type of chime and transformer your home already has. The latter might need replacing before a video doorbell can be installed. If not, then take your time, read all of the instructions carefully and remember to turn off the fuse box master switch before getting started.",technology
"Magill, along with Harvard President Claudine Gay and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth, participated in a contentious, more than five-hour grilling from lawmakers Tuesday over their response to antisemitism on their campuses.

They faced backlash for evading a question from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who asked about pro-Palestinian student protestors’ calls for “intifada” or “the genocide of Jews.”

“Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s rules or code of conduct, yes or no?” Stefanik asked Magill on Tuesday, to which Magill responded: “If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment.”

Stefanik slammed the response, saying: “Conduct meaning committing the act of genocide? The speech is not harassment? This is unacceptable.”

The other presidents responded similarly to the question. They said they personally did not agree with the rhetoric used by those students and were committed to preserving free speech on campus.

Magill is the first president to step down over a response to campus antisemitism. Stefanik called for all three presidents to be fired after the hearing. And in response to their testimony, several lawmakers and top officials across the aisle have slammed the presidents for refusing to say calls for “Jewish genocide” violate their codes of conduct around bullying or harassment.

Magill has faced scorching criticism from top Democrats in her state and other lawmakers. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) called Magill’s comments “offensive,” and said “calling for the genocide of Jews is antisemitic and harassment, full stop.” Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said Magill’s testimony was “embarrassing for a venerable Pennsylvania university.” And Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a first-term Democrat, also slammed Magill’s testimony as a “failure of leadership.” Hundreds of Penn alumni, donors and students have also called on Magill to resign.

Shapiro, who is a nonvoting member on Penn’s board, had called on the university’s board of directors to meet to determine whether Magill should be asked to resign.

The Wharton Board of Advisors on Thursday called for new university leadership, according to a letter obtained by The Daily Pennsylvanian. The Board of Trustees also held an emergency gathering that morning, according to the student newspaper, and had an executive committee luncheon.

Magill on Wednesday released a video statement apologizing for her testimony amid intense backlash. The video, published on X, has been viewed more than 37 million times.

In the video she said that during her testimony she was “focused on our university’s longstanding policies aligned with the U.S. Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable.” Magill also said her school would “initiate a serious and careful look at our policies.”

“I was not focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate,” she said.

Magill had been in the role for about a year and a half. She previously held positions at University of Virginia and Stanford University.

She will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn Carey Law.

More than 70 lawmakers on Friday urged the boards of Harvard, MIT and Penn to remove their presidents. About a dozen Democrats, however, urged the boards to fix their campus policies on bullying and harassment to ensure antisemitism is included.

House Education and the Workforce Chair Virginia Foxx (R-N.C), who held the hearing, said she “welcomed” Magill’s resignation.

“President Magill had three chances to set the record straight when asked if calling for the genocide of Jews violated UPenn’s code of conduct during our hearing on antisemitism,” Foxx said in a statement. “Instead of giving a resounding yes to the question, she chose to equivocate.”

Stefanik, who led the toughest questioning at Tuesday’s hearing and has called for all of the presidents to be fired, wrote on X that Magill’s “forced resignation” is only the beginning for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

“One down,” Stefanik said. “Two to go.”",political
"Although Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others in the administration have publicly declared that a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority should run the strip, they haven’t unveiled details of how that would work.

But they’ve already run into resistance from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has effectively ruled out a future Gaza role for the Palestinian Authority. Israeli officials for the most part are unwilling to discuss much beyond the current war, which was sparked by a vicious Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis.

Still, the U.S. strategists drawing up the plans keep coming back to the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank but has long been beset by allegations of corruption and inefficiency. It’s the most viable option, they say.

“We’re stuck,” the State Department official said. “There’s a strong policy preference for the PA to play a governing role in Gaza, but it has significant legitimacy and capability challenges.”

The broad vision emerging from the internal talks is that of a multiphase reconstruction of Gaza once the heavy fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants ends. An international force will be needed to stabilize the region in the immediate aftermath, followed by a revamped Palestinian Authority taking over long-term.

Key parts of the plan include increasing security-related aid that the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs offers the Palestinian Authority and allowing for a bigger role for the U.S. Security Coordinator, which has a track record of advising Palestinian security forces, the officials said.

“Ultimately, we want to have a Palestinian security structure in post-conflict Gaza,” a senior Biden administration official said.

All of the officials were granted anonymity to discuss a highly sensitive topic. They stressed that the ideas being floated are nascent and subject to many unpredictable variables. U.S. officials expect the heavy fighting to last several more weeks, at least.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment.

Any strategy set forth by the United States will face numerous obstacles, including Israeli skepticism and Arab frustration, even though regional players and analysts generally agree that Washington will need to play a critical role in the postwar phase.

“How you get there and what actually exists in Gaza to do that is really, really hard, as there isn’t a clean or easy answer,” one of the U.S. officials said.

The planning process is spearheaded by senior National Security Council official Brett McGurk. He is being assisted by Terry Wolff, a veteran of the Defense and State departments now at the NSC.

Other key figures involved include Barbara Leaf, Dan Shapiro and Hady Amr, who hold key Middle East roles at the State Department. The State Department units that deal with the Middle East and policy planning are involved, but other parts of the government are weighing in as needed.

Perhaps the trickiest immediate challenge is figuring out who will play a role in stabilizing Gaza in an interim post-fighting phase.

While Arab countries have appeared hesitant or outright unwilling to provide troops for Gaza, in more recent conversations some have seemed more open to the idea, the second U.S. official said. The Biden administration has ruled out sending U.S. troops. One idea that’s been bandied about is asking the United Arab Emirates to help rebuild health facilities or train civil servants.

The United Nations could play a role in Gaza in a postwar phase, at the very least on the humanitarian front, the second U.S. official said. However, the Israeli government is not a fan of the U.N., viewing it as biased against Israelis.

Neighboring Egypt is likely to play a major role in a postwar Gaza. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi’s suggestion that a future Palestinian state be demilitarized with a temporary international security presence has made the rounds in Biden administration circles.

“The big unknown is what exactly is going to be left of Hamas in Gaza,” the senior Biden administration official said. Even if the group’s numbers are low, their access to weapons could dramatically alter the calculus of countries considering sending troops.

One thing the United States hopes to see is more clear denunciations of Hamas by Arab rulers, many of whom privately despise the Islamist militant group, which they see as a potential threat to their own governments. Hamas wrested control of Gaza away from the Palestinian Authority more than 15 years ago.

The key to getting many Arab leaders on board for serious postwar planning appears to be that the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is the ultimate end goal.

The State Department official said American officials are largely motivated by that same outcome, but planning at the moment centers on stabilizing Gaza. One reason President Joe Biden and his aides have refused to call for a long-term cease-fire is that they support the Israeli objective of destroying Hamas, which Washington views as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.

The current Palestinian Authority is disliked by many Palestinians, who view it as corrupt, out of touch and weak. It has not held an election in years and is run by 88-year-old Mahmoud Abbas, who has yet to clearly denounce the Hamas attack.

A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority could not be reached for comment. Abbas is reported to have previously said that the Palestinian Authority won’t take over Gaza on the back of Israeli tanks, meaning it does not want to be seen as a puppet.

Although U.S. officials — including Biden himself — use the word “revitalized” to describe their hopes for a future Palestinian Authority running Gaza, words like “reformed,” “revamped” or “restructured” are probably more applicable.

In response to a request for comment from the Israeli government, an Israeli official, granted anonymity to discuss an issue still under review, said “the gap between the United States and Israel is much smaller than what meets the eye.”

“Both administrations agree that the PA in its current form cannot govern Gaza,” the official said. “A revitalized, reformed one might be able to do it. But we’re still not in discussions about what exactly this reform should look like.”

Still, it’s not clear what — if any — level of change to the Palestinian Authority would satisfy Netanyahu or his political allies.

Netanyahu has at times called for a new Palestinian governance structure in Gaza while also suggesting Israel should have some sort of general security control. His comments have not always been consistent, but they do not suggest an openness to future Palestinian Authority rule in Gaza.

The Israeli leader has long been accused of intentionally trying to undermine the Palestinian Authority as a way to avoid the creation of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu insists the Palestinian Authority is not a serious partner in the quest for a two-state solution and that it promotes hatred against Jews.

That said, it’s also unclear how much longer Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition will be in charge of Israel. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular, with many Israelis blaming him for the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. U.S. officials expect his eventual departure from the scene, but he’s managed political comebacks before.

U.S. officials haven’t had as much luck as they’d like in getting Israeli leaders to discuss in a meaningful way what a postwar Gaza will look like, the administration official said. And some analysts and officials in Washington worry that even trying to define what counts as the end of the war will over time become a point of contention between Israel and the United States. It’s not as if someone will blow a whistle and everyone lays down arms.

“The Israelis are in no mood to talk about the day after,” the administration official said. “They’re very much focused on today, the day of, so there hasn’t been a whole lot of traction there.”

Despite this, there’s virtually no internal Biden administration talk of conditioning U.S. military aid to Israel as a way to pressure the country to agree to some of the ideas under discussion in Washington, the State Department official said.

In an interview that aired this weekend on ABC News, Ron Dermer, a top Netanyahu aide, downplayed the idea of a Palestinian state, although he said an eventual political settlement could be reached with the Palestinians.

“I know that everybody is racing forward right now to try to establish a Palestinian state. For the people of Israel, they don’t even understand that because we just suffered the equivalent of 20 9/11s,” he said. “And I think the last thing you want to do is send a message to any terror group that the way you’re going to achieve some sort of aim is to perpetrate a massive terror attack.”

As it plans ahead, the Biden administration is consulting outside analysts, civil society activists and others, some of whom warned of potential pitfalls.

For one thing, Arab countries in the region cannot even agree among themselves how to approach a postwar scenario, and those are the countries the U.S. hopes will fund any reconstruction.

There’s also the U.S. presidential election in 2024. If a Republican wins, they are likely to defer even more to Israel’s wishes, even if that angers America’s Arab partners in the Middle East.

American officials mapping out the various scenarios are struggling because of the many variables involved. Unlike Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which the Biden administration saw coming months in advance, the Hamas attack was a surprise to the U.S. establishment.

Nearly two months in, “people are fried,” the administration official said.

The senior administration official sounded a more optimistic note: “We have identified every possible contingency,” the official said. “As things unfold, our hope is to be able to seize the moment.”

Brian Katulis, an analyst with the Middle East Institute, a Washington think tank, urged U.S. officials to try to help better organize Arab countries so that they can have a clearer voice in the direction of the conflict.

He sympathized with the frustrations of U.S. officials trying to solve the latest puzzle in the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“It’s sort of like the Choose Your Own Adventure book that you don’t control, because the circumstances will define what the possibilities are,” he said.

"Part of / Building for tomorrow

Husband and wife Ted Smith and Amanda Hawes spent decades working to expose toxic working conditions and pollution at the semiconductor plants that gave Silicon Valley its name. Now, with the Biden administration working to bring back the once-roaring industry, they’re gearing up for another fight.

President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act last year, setting aside $52.7 billion in funding for domestic chip manufacturing. The move was supposed to ease the pain of a global shortage of chips used in everything from cars to gaming consoles while creating tens of thousands of good jobs for Americans. It promises a return to the days before the 1990s, when the US was one of the leading producers of semiconductors — before global competition pushed many manufacturing jobs to Asia.

But the old semiconductor fabrication plants, known as fabs, had an ugly side. Toxic chemicals seeped into the ground and water sources near semiconductor plants and made their way into the bodies of workers and even their children.

Thanks to Silicon Valley, Santa Clara County is littered with more Superfund sites than any other county in the US. Those are sites so contaminated that the federal government has put them on a National Priorities List for cleanup. At a site where Intel made semiconductors between 1968 and 1981, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency lists more than a dozen different “contaminants of concern,” including arsenic, chloroform, and lead in groundwater. The agency has been working to clean up the groundwater since 1982, and the work will still take “many decades” to get to safe levels of trichloroethene (TCE), a known carcinogen.

While the semiconductor industry has phased out some dangerous substances, without more transparency about the kinds of chemicals they’re working with now, Smith and Hawes worry that a new generation of semiconductor workers could be blindsided by the risks. Health and labor advocates tell The Verge that the US still lacks fundamental protections for workers. Federal limits for how much of a toxin a worker can be exposed to haven’t been updated in decades.

“Put these protections in place from day one instead of learning the hard way. We’ve been through that once already,” says Hawes, a longtime occupational health attorney. “Let’s do it right this time.”

“Put these protections in place from day one instead of learning the hard way. We’ve been through that once already.”

When Smith and Hawes moved to San Jose, the biggest city in what’s now Silicon Valley, in the 1970s, the fruit and vegetable canning industry was still king. Smith thought it would be a great place to raise kids. Hawes fought for fair compensation for young women working in the canneries. Then, when the electronics industry started to take over, they hired many people from the same immigrant communities. Hawes started representing them, too, as they faced new problems at work.

Many of the fab employees worked in so-called “clean rooms,” highly controlled environments meant to prevent dust or any impurities from damaging a chip. Workers might wear “bunny suits” that covered them from head to toe to prevent particles from falling off their bodies and onto the silicon wafers they worked with. They weren’t designed, however, to protect workers from breathing in fumes that might come from “cleaning” the wafers with industrial solvents like TCE.

The risks didn’t stay in clean rooms. TCE wound up leaking out of IBM’s underground storage tanks and contaminating residents’ drinking water in San Jose. More toxic spills were spotted after that high-profile case.

“When it got into the water, it was like, ‘Oh my God, this could be me. This can be my family,’” Smith tells The Verge. He started an advocacy group with other residents called the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. Hawes, meanwhile, co-founded the Santa Clara Center for Occupational Safety and Health (SCCOSH) to fight for workers.

In the 1990s, the dangers associated with toxic chemicals used at semiconductor plants were finally coming to light. By 1992, three separate industry-backed studies had found higher than expected rates of miscarriages among women who worked in semiconductor plants. They traced the problem back to ethylene glycol ethers (EGEs) used in the photoresist substances that coat semiconductors.

In 1999, an article in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives named 10 “chemicals of concern in the semiconductor industry” that include known carcinogens and other substances tied to reproductive health problems, like arsenic, lead, and TCE. IBM and other manufacturers also faced a slew of lawsuits filed by former workers who had developed cancer, suffered miscarriages, or whose children were born with intellectual disabilities or birth defects. Many of them were ultimately settled out of court.

Together, and with the help of workers sounding the alarm across the US, Smith and Hawes secured some key wins. The industry pledged to phase out the use of EGEs. After SCCOSH pushed for a ban on TCE, California adopted the strictest exposure limit for the substance anywhere in the world, according to Hawes.

Even after several decades of work to clean up the semiconductor industry, though, risks to workers have persisted. A 2017 Bloomberg investigation found that reproductive toxins phased out in the US in the 1990s were still used years later in semiconductor plants run by Samsung and other companies in Asia and were making workers sick.

And one fundamental thing hasn’t changed in the US: exposure limits set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are still woefully inadequate, Smith, Hawes, and other labor advocates say. Most of those “permissible exposure limits” (PELs) were set in the 1970s and haven’t changed since. As a result, many PELs “are outdated and inadequate for ensuring protection of worker health,” OSHA’s own website says. Online, OSHA lists its own standards alongside more stringent thresholds developed by California, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the nonprofit American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). While California has its own state regulations that are often more stringent than national limits, the stricter thresholds from other groups are only “recommendations.”

Meanwhile, public agencies and private companies are racing to launch more fabs in the US. Within the first year of the CHIPS and Science Act becoming law, companies have submitted more than 460 statements of interest to the Department of Commerce for funding. On top of that, companies have cumulatively announced more than $230 billion in private investment for semiconductor manufacturing in the US since Biden took office.

Without tougher legal standards, Hawes says, “we’re getting ready to repeat the same stuff… My concern is that [companies are] still adhering to exposure limits that have never been health-protective.”

“OSHA has been highly underresourced for many years. They’re constantly under attack”

OSHA spokesperson Kimberly Darby said in an email that “the agency’s rulemaking capacity is much less than the need for new rules or for updating PELs.” Developing a new rule takes “years” because of requirements to conduct analyses on risk and feasibility and to give stakeholders opportunities to comment, according to Darby. The agency actually tried to update 212 of its exposure limits in 1989 and create 164 new PELs for previously unregulated substances. But the proposed rulemaking faced legal challenges, and a court vacated the whole thing. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan campaigned on a promise to get rid of OSHA altogether.

“OSHA has been highly underresourced for many years. They’re constantly under attack by the regulated community,” says Tracey Woodruff, an expert in chemical and regulatory policy and the director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco. “It’s just been a neglected agency for so long.”

But the fight for tougher environmental and health protections is picking up momentum alongside the push for manufacturing. “When we found out the chips were coming back to the US through the CHIPS program, we decided that we better get our information out to people who have not heard about any of this,” Smith says.

The husband and wife team have joined a new coalition called Chips Communities United, which also has backing from Sierra Club, the Communications Workers of America union, and other labor groups. In October, they published a letter addressed to semiconductor industry execs asking them to work collaboratively on protections for semiconductor fab workers and nearby communities. Specifically, they’re asking them to sign legally binding community benefit agreements wherever they build these new fabs. On top of hiring diverse staff and respecting the right of workers to organize, they’re calling on companies to replace chemicals that can cause cancer, miscarriages, or birth defects and fetal brain damage. In cases where there are no substitutes, they’re asking companies to go beyond following OSHA’s outdated exposure limits and adhere to more stringent standards instead.

“Legal doesn’t mean safe when it comes to toxics in this industry, and a focus on compliance with existing law will not keep workers and community members safe,” says Etana Jacobi, a senior campaign lead with IUE-CWA, the industrial division of CWA.

The letter also asks for a “review of facility design to ensure protection of air and water resources.” Members of the coalition say they’d like to see more transparency from companies when it comes to sharing what kinds of chemicals workers are handling — an issue they say the industry has historically been tight-lipped about in the name of protecting trade secrets.

The Verge reached out to the Semiconductor Industry Association, but it declined to speak on the record. We also contacted Intel, Samsung, and IBM to ask about their safety protocols and what chemicals workers might come in contact with in fabs. IBM didn’t respond. (The company still designs chips but partners with other companies for manufacturing now.) Samsung says it follows the law wherever it operates and has protocols to prevent chemicals from coming in contact with workers but did not specify what those chemicals might be.

Intel says it stopped using underground storage tanks at its facilities “decades ago.” The EPA took one of three Intel Superfund sites off its National Priorities List in 2019 after deeming the cleanup complete. “While there are many chemicals used in our facilities, the equipment used to process wafers in our fabs is required to achieve SEMI’s [a trade group] semiconductor industry standards during normal operations and maintenance activities,” Intel spokesperson Chelsea Hughes said in an email. Smith also gives Intel credit for joining the Clean Electronics Production Network, a network that includes companies, NGOs, researchers, and the EPA. He says Intel was involved in developing a guidance document (which Smith also worked on) on how to establish occupational safety and health committees in electronics plants.

“It still takes people to actually make these things run”

Both Intel and Samsung say that much of their operations have become nearly fully automated over the years. Even so, Smith doubts that’s a cure-all. “It still takes people to actually make these things run even though they’re highly automated. And so there still is the opportunity for exposure — and it’s never to one chemical, it’s mixtures of chemicals.”

The chemical cocktail changes faster than toxicologists can keep up with, says Bruce Fowler, an adjunct professor of environmental health at Emory University and co-founder of Toxicology and Risk Assessment Consulting Services. Fowler has studied the health risks of chemicals used in semiconductor fabs for decades. Despite the tireless work, “the synthesis and use and application of chemicals is outracing the ability of the toxicology community to make safe evaluations,” he says.",technology

"Can you believe that the first mention of Apple’s potential move into the automotive space was way back in 2014? Yup, almost a decade ago, rumors surfaced that Apple’s 'Project Titan' would involve more than 1,000 engineers and that the results would be some kind of futuristic fully-autonomous vehicle.

Alas, the dream of self-driving cars hasn't been realized as fast as many tech insiders first imagined, so the project has been scaled back. But major players at Apple, including Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch, are still reportedly on the project. The Apple Car could be closer than you think, but is now the perfect timing?

It could well be, because a lot has changed in the 10 years since Project Titan’s initial leaks, with arguably the most seismic shift in the automotive industry gathering an irriversible head of steam, particularly in the last couple of years.

Governments around the globe have set hard (ish) targets for phasing out the internal combustion engine, while the world’s biggest automakers have committed to an all-electric line-up by 2040, 2035, or if you are Nissan, Kia and Hyundai, as early as 2030.

The results are already tangible. In 2020, global EV sales were around the 3 million mark but by 2023, that had already rocketed to 10.25 million. It is predicted that by 2028, those sales will crest the 17 million mark and make up the majority of new car sales in developed markets.

This switch to electric motors and battery packs has transformed the way modern cars are designed and built, and this is particularly pertinent for EVs. Fewer moving mechanicals nearly always means more tech, and aside from the obvious battery packs, electric motors, suspension, braking and steering systems, modern EVs are more or less gigantic computers on wheels.

This has allowed relative newcomers, like Elon Musk’s Tesla, to prove that what was once essentially a tech start-up business could take on the might of the establishment… and win. Suddenly, we are faced with a market leader that isn’t Ford, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors or any other 'legacy' OEM.

With success comes competition and one of Tesla’s biggest rivals is Chinese carmaker BYD, another EV brand that has shot from relative obscurity to the main stage in recent years. Zeekr, Xpeng and Nio are just a handful of other Chinese electric car companies that are beginning to make major in-roads in North American, European and Middle Eastern markets, as well as topping sales charts in their enormous domestic market.

So, with the growing acceptance of vehicles that lack those coveted historical bonnet badges, why couldn’t a tech company succeed in the buzzing EV environment?

Navigating the user experience

(Image credit: Mercedes-Benz)

Aside from EVs, the other monumental paradigm shift in the automotive industry has been the relentless focus on infotainment. As vehicle refinement has improved to the point that it is tricky to distinguish one manufacturer's car from another, it is now often down to the quality of the digital experience to steal sales.

What’s more, electric vehicles have moved towards the software-defined vehicle (SDV) category, which means much of the vehicle's functionality (and even its powertrain) can be tweaked and updated via over-the-air updates (OTA).

Bottom line is, cars are becoming increasingly like your phone, tablet or laptop, whether you agree with that or not.

Most of today’s automotive start-ups have seized the opportunity to create all-encompassing ecosystems that play nicely with your smartphone of choice. We are not simply talking about a bit of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality, but apps that can remotely unlock the vehicle, organize your service schedule and even add new vehicle features via subscription packages. Tesla is fantastic at this, but Rivian, Lucid and many others have followed suit.

Alas, 'legacy' automakers have been slow to catch up to this, likely down to the fact they are often embroiled in lengthy contracts with technology partners, or that they are tied into inflexible product cycles.

More recently, Mercedes-Benz has said it is looking to combat this with its own operating system, while Porsche has more recently turned to the Android Automotive developer toolkit to look after the underpinnings of future infotainment systems.

But if your future car is more about the digital experience and operating system than it is about the minutiae of suspension set-up and the linearity of its torque curve, why not entrust the entire thing to an established tech provider?

Xiaomi strikes first

(Image credit: China MIIT)

Leaks from China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) last month revealed that Xiaomi was busy homologating its first electric car – the SU7 Sedan.

Set to be produced in conjunction with partners Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Company (BAIC), who will be handling all of the traditional car stuff, the SU7 looks set to be the first vehicle that is truly seamless with the existing Xiaomi ecosystem. A proper extension of the smartphone.

It is expected to be offered in a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive variant, producing 295hp, while a more exotic all-wheel-drive version will also go on sale that produces 663hp. There’s talk of an 800-Volt architecture (for fast charging) and 100kWh battery, which should result in an electric range in excess of 400-miles.

It’s likely to be a great EV, but potential customers will possibly be more interested in the fact it looks set to boast facial recognition, via a camera mounted on the B-pillar, which will allow owners to unlock and start the car without a key.

There's scant detail about smartphone integration, but we imagine it will be an essential part of the vehicle's functionality, acting as an additional screen, a digital key and offering the ability for drivers and occupants to continue their smartphone life inside the vehicle.

This isn't some flash in the pan, either, as recent reports suggest Xiaomi is more serious about its entry into the automotive sphere, with rumors that a hybrid model will rapidly follow the launch of its inaugural EV, as well as further models in the pipeline.

Huawei expands its auto operations

(Image credit: Aito)

Although the Chinese tech giant Huawei is adamant it won’t manufacture an electric vehicle, its HarmonyOS is proving popular with the many carmakers it is currently working with in its domestic market.

Changan, which already offers the Avatr electric vehicle brand (itself powered by Huawei’s operating system), has said it is set to expand its technology partnerships with Huawei in the future.

Similarly, BAIC Motors and JAC Motors recently confirmed new working relationships, which will lead to a number of new Chinese EVs powered by Huawei smarts.

So far, we’ve already witnessed the Aito M5, which was built by Chinese manufacturer Seres but which featured a whole host of Huawei tech, including the ability to unlock the vehicle with the brand’s smartwatches.

(Image credit: Aito)

Again, this is currently limited to China and select Asian markets, but many of these burgeoning brands are rapidly becoming commonplace in parts of Europe, North America and beyond. Just look at BYD's recent successes outside of its domestic market.

But completing this serendipitous tech cycle is the news that some of these aforementioned Chinese automotive start-ups are also dabbling in smartphone tech. Nio recently launched a $900 Android phone in China, while we reported on Polestar teasing a high-end Android phone at its recent Polestar Day event in LA.

Both of these examples are rumored to offer UWB technology that can act as the vehicle’s key, provide an additional screen when in the car and take care of much of the vehicle’s comfort and convenience features.

This closing of the tech circle will only reinforce consumer confidence, bringing the idea of tech companies as carmakers into the public conscience and making the transition smoother.

Autonomous entertainment

(Image credit: Sony)

Traditional OEMs, many of which have dominated the industry for over 100 years, are likely breathing a sigh of relief that the road towards fully autonomous driving is proving long and arduous.

Because when that time comes, the thought of being loyal to one particular automotive brand goes out the window. The traditional ownership model will change, car-sharing will become commonplace and occupants will care less about their surroundings and more about what they can achieve during the journey.

Even now, in-car entertainment is racing ahead, as manufacturers look to allow passengers to binge on boxsets and play games on the move. Porsche’s Taycan and upcoming Panamera feature a screen that allows the front passenger to watch whatever they like, all without distracting the driver.

(Image credit: Sony)

What’s more, anyone stuck at a slow EV charging station will attest to the importance of streaming or in-car gaming services while they wait.

Sony unveiled its Vision-S concept at CES back in 2020, but what seemed surprising then now increasingly makes more sense.

After all, why form a partnership with an existing OEM to licence the use of PlayStations in vehicles when you could just make the vehicle, complete with the latest audio systems, television technology and smartphone integration? It's a move that other tech giants appear to be embracing in increasing numbers, so don't be surprised if that Apple Car does eventually see the light of day.",technology

All right.

Well, we are here to talk about the short-term rental market

and the short-term rental economy.

Obviously, you know, short-term rentals were

a huge player in building the sharing economy.

And today, they are the focus

of policy discussions around the world,

so I'm sure a lot of you know,

you know, that New York recently banned,

effectively banned short-term rentals.

Cities like Paris and Amsterdam are sharply limiting them.

So what does the future

of the short-term rental market look like?

How can technology make it better in the next 30 years?

We're gonna talk about all of that and more

with Jon Gieselman, who is president

of Expedia Brands at Expedia Group.

Jon, come join us.

[audience clapping]

Hello, there.

Hello. Thanks for having me.

Thank you for being here. So why don't you start?

When I think about Expedia,

I will admit I don't automatically think short-term rentals.

Explain Expedia to me.

I think about sort of booking trips, booking travel,

but tell us a little bit, sort of about Expedia Group.

So Expedia Group is a collection

of 21 different travel businesses around the world.

It's first started with Expedia,

which is probably the most well known here in the US

that was actually born outta Microsoft 27 years ago.

And it's largely a collection of web-based businesses,

many of which were created at the start of the internet age.

And oddly enough, I worked for our chairman 27 years ago

and he started acquiring all of these businesses.

So I've been around them for a long time indirectly,

but just not until recently.

I've only been inside the company for two and a half years.

So really what we've set out to do

in the last couple of years is take these 27 businesses

that all ran on their own stacks.

Nothing was integrated.

It was really like an operating company really

where the businesses actually competed with one another.

And we have been rebuilding the stack

all on one common architecture

so that everything was integrated.

So we were talking about it before,

think of it like acquiring 20 businesses at once

and then integrating them, you know,

all into your existing stack at once.

It's a pretty big lift and a pretty big swing.

We frankly probably wouldn't have done it

if it had not been for COVID,

because COVID kind of provided the cover to do it,

'cause when your business goes to zero,

it's time for you to start thinking big.

So it kind of afforded us the cover

to make this huge technology investment.

Fascinating.

And, you know, in 2014, WIRED magazine,

well before I was there,

they published this great cover story

All about the sharing economy.

The idea that sharing your home or your car

with somebody else was sort of meaningfully contributing

to increased trust among Americans.

It was a really smart thesis, it was a really smart piece.

When you think about trust, sort of what kinds of decisions

have you made with Vrbo, which is your sort of

short-term rental home sharing platform

to allow consumers, you know,

to really trust the properties that they are renting,

to trust the owners that are listed on the platform?

Okay, well, Vrbo has been around for 30 years.

You may remember it as Vrbo,

somebody before me cleverly renamed it Vrbo,

so I can't take credit for that.

You know, there's primarily two players in the industry.

Vrbo and then another one I won't mention

that I might reference throughout, you know, this vaguely.

And the key difference between the two is

think of us as kind of the adult in the room.

These are large private homes where

you can go with your family, your friends, your coworkers,

your roommates from college, whatever but it's all private.

And they are predominantly in think beach, mountains,

you know, out in the country.

It's not city and they are not shared spaces.

So we don't have that dynamic where

you'll show up at a up at a place

and, you know, you've got half of the refrigerator

to yourself, or you open a drawer in the bathroom

and there's a bunch of weird stuff in there you can't unsee.

You know, these are all private homes that we have.

So that's how we're different.

That engenders trust.

And we've set the marketplace up in such a way

where hosts who are people that own private homes,

either you know their second home

or they've bought it as a business that they wanna run.

We align everybody's objectives where hosts will...

If they treat our customers right and well,

they will be successful in the marketplace.

If they do things like cancel on people at the last minute

or don't make their home available, there's limited supply,

those kinds of actions will be penalized,

and they will not be as successful.

So, you know, the way we've set up the marketplace

is to encourage hosts to be successful,

to treat our customers the way any of you

would wanna be treated.

Great.

Well, let's sort of shift gears a little bit

and talk about, you know, the impact of short-term rentals

on housing and the housing market.

Obviously, a subject of great controversy

and sort of one of the reasons for some of these

new policies and regulations and restrictions.

Can you sort of talk about, you know,

how you think about that impact at Expedia Group?

Well, first of all,

the impact is different all over the world.

I mean, as you can imagine, local governments

or city governments, they tend to live on the extremes.

Either, you know, do one thing to the excess

or completely shut something down.

And a lot of local governments struggle with that.

You know, should we open up our marketplace

or our city to, you know, more short-term rentals

or should we shut the whole thing down?

And, you know, that makes for great headlines

if you're trying to get elected,

but it's not very practical.

So we tend to take the approach, you know,

again, trying to be the adult in the room of,

it's just like anything else, it's about balance.

I mean, you can find a place where you have

a material amount of short-term rental supply

in a marketplace, but you don't let it go crazy

to the point where it's causing disruption.

You know, your neighbors hate you.

People are complaining, you know,

so cities, local governments are all struggling

with this right now.

They tend to take an extreme position on either end

and, you know, we're happy to actually work with them.

You know, we're in favor of regulation,

but you try and find the middle ground.

And some markets have done this successfully.

San Diego is one where they've chosen to...

They've decided that roughly 1% of the housing

is gonna be dedicated to short-term rentals.

And there are a bunch of stipulations with that

which encourage, you know, good behavior.

And we've helped them with data to settle on that opinion.

Seattle is another one that has done a good job.

They, you know, something different

that they limit the number of licenses per homeowner.

You can only have two short-term rentals.

We're giving Europe all of our data and their learnings.

They're tending to take a common approach across the EU

from a data standpoint.

But what makes it challenging from a tech standpoint

is then within Europe,

cities are taking different approaches.

So then, you know, we have to come up with custom solutions

for each market based on, you know,

what they decide to regulate.

But you know, our competitors have in the past

taken the approach of more supply is better

and really haven't paid attention

to the consequences of that.

But it can create, you know, real problems

if you've got too much.

So it's all about finding the right balance,

just like it is with anything.

You talked a little bit about sort of the data

that you're sharing with governments or municipalities.

Can you tell us anything else about what that entails?

And sort of what kind of data a government might look at

when they're trying to make decisions

about this kind of regulation?

Well, I mean, I won't get into what exactly we share,

but you know, it's just like, you know,

a market that's successful has a balanced amount

of supply and demand and, you know,

you wanna strike that balance,

because you have home homeowners that have second homes.

You know, they want to be able to monetize them.

That drives tax revenue for, you know, the local government.

It also encourages tourism.

You know, many people won't travel

unless they have a private home they can stay into.

They don't wanna stay in a hotel.

So, you know, you want to find that right balance.

That's why shutting it down doesn't really make sense.

You know, and some cities have taken that approach.

Like New York, they've taken a pretty aggressive approach.

It hasn't really impacted us because as I said,

our private homes, excuse me, are predominantly out

in rural areas on the beach.

They're not really in the city.

Way we compete in cities is with hotels.com or Expedia.

So, you know, our spaces in cities tend to be in hotels.

So it's, you know, it's had a big impact on our competition.

But again, you know, we've tried to work with New York

to find a balanced approach just like we would anywhere.

And as sort of the adults in the room.

Your phrase, not mine, although I like it.

Is there sort of any other feedback that you would offer

to your competitors in the industry about course correction?

You talked about balance and sort of,

there's no extreme version of this either way

that will be ultimately successful.

But would there be sort of any other guidance

that you would offer to the industry writ large?

Well, if it's kind of growth at all costs

and it doesn't really...

The consequences don't matter,

eventually, you're gonna get regulated

and the solutions are gonna be thrust upon you

rather than being a part of this solution.

So, you know, it's always better to be part

of those decisions and try and influence them

rather than buck up against them.

Yeah. Sure, sure.

Well, let's talk about technology,

which we haven't done enough of so far.

So obviously, you know, the travel industry

has embraced tech in a big way in the last few years.

Biometric check-ins, robotics in customer lounges.

So you are betting, you know, big

on something called the Expedia One Key program.

Can you tell us a little bit about that?

Yeah, so part of taking over the, you know,

all these businesses two and a half years ago,

I think, I'm probably gonna get some of these numbers wrong,

but I think we had 17 different CRM stacks,

seven loyalty programs, five credit cards.

Somehow, we had 32 CMS systems.

I don't even know how that was possible,

but it was a mess and nothing talked to one another.

So it sort of became obvious to me from week one

that we literally need to rebuild

the whole damn thing on one common stack,

and get everything talking to one another.

Because the opportunity for us as a business,

if you've got 21 brands, think about it,

you're trying to drive downloads in the app stores,

you know, around the world,

across all these different brands.

You're diluting your capital investment

across all these different businesses.

So the way to be efficient is to

fix the architecture problem.

So we did that.

And as part of that, the other big opportunity

was nobody knew these brands were related.

I mean, I'm sure there's people here in the room,

they're hearing for the first time,

oh, I didn't know Vrbo, and hotels.com, and Travelocity,

and Orbitz, and Expedia were all part of the same company.

Why would you know they all competed with one another?

That was the model, you know, for many, many years,

which was successful but, you know,

eventually just ran outta gas

because as the cost of media increases every year,

it's basically an arbitrage business where you're trying to,

you know, buy traffic for X and monetize it for Y,

it's difficult to become more and more efficient.

There's no leverage in that model.

So, you know, we turn the whole thing sideways

and you know, and now we're managing it like so many...

I call it like subscription-like businesses

where you're managing customers for LTV, acquire them once,

drive them cross shopping within your portfolio of brands

rather than acquiring on Expedia,

then acquiring them on Vrbo, then acquiring them on Hotels.

Like, that's just stupid.

So part of that was we took all

the disparate loyalty programs we have

and turned it into one.

So now, you know, Vrbo is...

We were talking about Vrbo,

but Vrbo is the only one in the industry

that now has a loyalty program.

So if, you know, you go and you rent a Vrbo for a week,

and some of them are super expensive, you know,

15, 20 grand, you'll get 2% back on that,

and you can use that cash, we call it One Key Cash.

It's cash that sits in your Hotels, Expedia, Vrbo account.

You can use it for, you know, a hotel on Expedia,

or a hotel on hotels.com, or a car, you know, at Expedia.

Whatever. It's just cash.

And then the intent of it was to really do two things,

make it clear in consumer's minds, traveler's minds

that all these brands are related

and part of one ecosystem,

and then encourage that cross shopping,

you know, between the brands.

So basically acquire 'em once

and then manage customer lifecycle, you know, going forward.

So it was both a technology challenge,

but it really had a strategic intent behind it

to encourage people and reward people for their business,

you know, keeping them in the ecosystem.

And have you sort of observed anything about,

you know, consumer behavior using this new program

that's kind of stands out to you?

Yeah, it's only four months old, but it's working.

You know, we're seeing customers cross shop between brands

and most importantly, we're seeing them shop incrementally

so their repeat rates are increasing,

and that was the whole design of it.

So it's performing as intended. It's very early.

I mean, you know, a loyalty program,

for anybody that works on one or has launched one

or been around one, it's not like a hockey stick.

I mean, it doesn't just like instantly double the business.

It's a long build but it was designed in such a way...

You know, I was at Apple before this

and I just kind of approached it of like,

what would Apple have done with a loyalty program?

It's just like, make it simple, make it easy to understand,

you know, and yet we actually want people

to, you know, redeem their rewards.

It's not like most rewards programs.

I mean, I remember when my team was first iterating on it,

they would come to me with, you know, a spreadsheet,

you know, this is how the product should work.

And I was like, How do you design a loyalty program

with a fucking spreadsheet?

I mean, you know, it's not about breakage.

It's about encouraging people

to actually use it so that they come back.

You know, it's not about penalizing them in a clever way.

And I think a lot of loyalty programs are designed that way.

So I kind of call it the unloyalty program

because it is just very different

than most programs are constructed.

Got it, and you know, it's sort of been

the theme of the year, generative AI.

It's something we've talked a lot about at WIRED.

It's something we're talking a lot about today.

You know, are you, at Expedia group, using Gen AI tools?

How do you sort of see them

fitting into the future of travel?

Short-term rentals? The whole thing?

Many of you may not believe this,

but I mean, we were talking about it before.

I think a big part of our transformation is

I used to call us a 27-year-old technology company,

and we're trying to turn ourselves into a tech company.

And I think those things are very different,

but we are pretty sophisticated.

I mean, there's 10,000 engineers in the company.

I mean, you know, it's a big business, pretty sophisticated.

Travel is soul crushingly complex.

The problems that can arise, you know,

on any given trip are limitless.

The number of SKUs that we have in our store,

we have more SKUs than Amazon.

So it's a very, very complex business.

As a result, AI is not new to us.

You know, we've been leveraging it for three or four years,

very advanced from a machine learning standpoint.

You know, we were the first to integrate with open AI.

You know, we use AI a lot of different ways for Vrbo.

You know, one way is we have a trust and safety group.

We can identify if somebody's booking a house for a party

and just shut it down immediately.

We shut down more than 500 of 'em last year.

And that engenders trust in the platform.

You know, we're using it to identify,

help customers understand more features, you know,

inside of a house or amenities in and around the area.

So we're kind of all in on it and have been for a bit

maybe, you know, a little bit further ahead

than some others, but, you know,

it's amazing to see the advancement.

And it's just kinda every quarter,

there's something even more amazing

that we can take advantage of.

It's pretty remarkable.

[Interviewer] How do you talk about it sort of internally

and sort of think about it?

Do you have task forces?

Like, how do you grapple with the pace of the change

in the generative AI space, and sort of what it can do

for your company?

Yeah, I think culturally inside of our company,

it's been one that's been based on optimization,

which is fine and great.

I wouldn't say it's been a terribly creative company

from an innovation standpoint.

So trying to inject that into our culture

has been, for me, really fun

because, you know, it's not...

You know, creativity is a broad term.

I don't think of it just in terms of creative,

like from a marketing standpoint, developing in,

you know, creative campaign.

Creativity can be applied across the organization,

whether you're in finance, or HR,

or engineering, whatever it is, you know?

Finding creative solutions to solve real problems,

and there's plenty of real problems in travel.

You know, I think the holy grail for us is to use AI

to start to predict and solve those problems

before customers even understand

that they're about to happen.

Well, let me ask you this then.

We have just a few more minutes.

But thinking 10, 20, maybe even 30 years out,

what does someone's travel experience

with Expedia look like?

What changes? What's sort of your utopia?

Yeah, I mean, 30 years, I have no idea.

But, you know, I would say in five

and, you know, we're working on this now

with some pretty sophisticated partners.

It's what I just said.

It's identifying problems and pain points

before they actually happen and solving them proactively

for our customers, for our travelers.

And then creating surprise and delight moments,

you know, for all of us, while we're traveling.

Our businesses have largely been transactional.

You know, book a flight, book a hotel, book a Vrbo,

book a car, and then go do your thing.

And we hope everything goes okay,

but if something happens, call us,

and hopefully, it's not too bad,

and we can solve it with our partners.

We don't control any of the flights or hotels or anything.

You know, but we've taken the money, you know,

so we gotta solve it for people.

Imagine a place where, you know, right now, today,

I think the worst part of travel is the travel part.

It just sucks usually.

You know, imagine if those pain points just didn't exist

and they were proactively solved for you,

and you were like, Wow, those people had my back.

I'm gonna go back to them and how clever of them

that they were able to fix something

before I even knew it happened.

Yeah, sounds much better

than my experience getting here, I will tell you.

And last question, in case anyone is planning a vacation,

do you have a favorite Vrbo that you have stayed in

or one that you have your eye on in your marketplace?

Is there a really cool tree house somewhere

that we should all be booking?

You know, I won't say one property,

but I will point out, you know, one more difference

of us versus our competition.

Our competition tends to talk about, you know,

the tree house or the Yes, they do.

You know, the hot dog house or the spaceship house.

The really cool trailer. Yeah.

You know, like I would encourage everybody,

like, go stay in the house with a pool,

and a nice grill, and a hot tub.

[Interviewer] Really good air conditioning.

Maybe a plunge pool, yeah, maybe it has air conditioning.

It's not like this ridiculous stupid thing

that you're like, Why the hell did I do this?

You know, that's the big difference.

But, you know, if that's what you're into, spaceships.

You know, we've got a campaign coming out next year,

which will, you know, clearly portray the differences

between the two of them.

But it kind of comes down to the idea of, you know,

yeah, you can go stay in the space ship

or you can stay in amazing property

and, you know, gaze of the stars all night.

That's the differences between the two things.

And if you like discovering that weird shit

in the bathrooms and stuff, go with the other guys.

[laughs] Well, on that note,

thank you so much for being here, that was fantastic.

Thanks for having me.

"A Weibo user has leaked images and system specifications of Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Book 4, which uses Intel's Core Ultra 9 185H Meteor Lake CPU (via @9550pro on X). The leak includes clear images of the internal layout of the Galaxy Book 4 (presumably the Ultra model) and screenshots from CPU-Z.

Unfortunately, we didn't get much benchmarking data from this leak since the leaker was, in their own words, ""too lazy to run"" benchmarks. They did share a CPU-Z benchmark result, and the performance is roughly on par with AMD's Ryzen 7 7700X. However, CPU-Z's built-in test isn't known for being great, so drawing early conclusions based on this single data point is probably not a good idea.

Although the Weibo user didn't specify what laptop he was showing off, it's all but sure the laptop is Samsung's Galaxy Book 4, which is rumored to be announced on December 15. The internal layout of the leaked laptop is highly similar to that of the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra, which has the same color scheme on the PCB, the exact placement of M.2 slots and USB ports, and even near-identical cable routing.

According to the leak, this Galaxy Book 4 is equipped with the Core Ultra 9 185H and Nvidia's RTX 4070, paired with an improved vapor chamber cooler. The laptop also has Power Delivery 3.1 charging and uses a 140-watt charger. We can also guess the computer has the same ports as the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra: HDMI, Micro SD, 3.5mm audio, a single USB Type-A port, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports.

The CPU-Z screenshot reveals that the Core Ultra 9 185H has a 45-watt TDP, which is standard for Intel's H-class chips. We also see that the CPU uses the C0 stepping, which indicates what version of Meteor Lake the chip operates. Steppings are organized by letter (a distinct version) and divided by number. If you're familiar with software updates for games or GPU drivers, C0 means version 3.0.

A stepping of C0 implies a somewhat longer development process than usual. For comparison, Ryzen 7000 Raphael chips use the B2 stepping, Ryzen 5000 Vermeer CPUs initially used the B0 stepping but later moved to B2, and Intel's Raptor Lake processors are all on B0. Alder Lake CPUs had a stepping of C0, much like Meteor Lake, and there are parallels between the two chips. Alder Lake was developed on the troubled Intel 7 (formerly 10nm) node, and Meteor Lake is the first CPU to use the Intel 4 (previously 7nm) node, which also saw its development issues.

Intel will announce Meteor Lake on December 14, so corresponding laptops should be around the corner.",technology
"Breton put French AI startup Mistral in the same category as the U.S. Big Tech firms EU officials usually love to lambast | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images

Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

French companies keen to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence — and to rein in European Union regulatory ambitions — have a surprising opponent: the European Commission’s self-styled digital enforcer and über-Frenchman Thierry Breton.

Speaking before an audience of startups and tech investors in Marseille in late November, the EU's internal market chief called out the French AI hopefuls who are lobbying to erode the EU’s landmark Artificial Intelligence Act.

Breton singled out Mistral — a French AI startup backed by prestigious Silicon Valley investors — putting it in the same category as the U.S. Big Tech firms EU officials usually love to lambast.

“Mistral is lobbying —that’s normal,” Breton said at the event, organized by French newspaper La Tribune. “But we are not fooled: it is defending its business, not the general interest.”

Breton qualified his remarks. He said that Kyutai, a newly launched AI laboratory backed by two French tycoons, Xavier Niel and Rodolphe Saadé, and former Google executive Eric Schmidt is “in the general interest and totally open, it is an initiative that interests and pleases me.”

Breton was stating the obvious, but his words were met with bafflement by France’s AI ecosystem.

“We kind of had the idea that he was on our side,” says the public affairs manager of a French tech company attending the event in Marseille, granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly. “Obviously, Mistral AI represents private interests — but its work is just as open source as Kyutai’s.”

Many French companies, Mistral chief among them, have over the past few months argued that regulating advanced AI models would deter European innovation. Their pleas found a sympathetic audience in the French government, which alongside those of Germany and Italy is pushing back against rules on “foundation models” proposed by the European Parliament.

The term foundation model is Brussels-speak for the digital infrastructure underpinning mighty multipurpose AI systems such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Such models are widely considered the engines of the ongoing AI gold rush.



The Parliament would like to create binding rules of transparency but also of testing on the most powerful models, while governments propose voluntary codes of conduct.

EU policymakers are nearing the end of negotiations on the bloc’s AI rulebook, but the clash over foundation models could still derail a final deal.

Breton’s fighting words are unlikely to earn him many friends in Paris.

President Emmanuel Macron, a tech enthusiast who used to wax lyrical about remaking France into a “startup nation” has thrown his weight squarely behind French AI companies, and has volunteered to host the third AI Safety Summit in November 2024. Last month, speaking in front of researchers, Macron advocated for a global approach to AI regulation to avoid hampering European companies.

Macron has thrown his weight squarely behind French AI companies | Pool photo by Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images

Macron’s digital minister Jean-Noël Barrot has repeatedly lambasted the European Parliament’s regulatory plans, illustrating France’s obsession with not missing out on the AI gold rush as it did for the internet and social media. Barrot’s predecessor, Cédric O, sits on Mistral’s board.

There is another reason Breton’s comments are going to rankle. For some time, France’s strategy hinged on luring young AI developers away from U.S. giants. Exhibit A is Mistral itself, whose three co-founders hail from Google and Meta.

But in the past few months, France has grown increasingly willing to lean on U.S. companies to break the technological ceiling and build its ecosystem.

That was on full display recently, during the saga of Sam Altman’s — later reversed — ouster as CEO of OpenAI, when Barrot publicly invited him to move to France.

The shift was partly masterminded by another French golden boy, researcher and Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun. As early as 2015, LeCun played a key role in kickstarting Meta’s Paris research lab, FAIR.

“France is lucky to have him. He is one of the fathers of AI, which made him a tutelary figure in the industry,” says a startup lobbyist granted anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly.

That is not to say that Breton is the only one fighting in AI regulation’s corner.

Mark Brakel, policy lead at global AI-focused think tank the Future of Life Institute said that Breton is “completely right” and that lobbying by Mistral and other tech companies “risks sacrificing the benefits of the many for the profits of the few.”

The French cultural sector has also expressed strong concerns that France will sacrifice intellectual property on the altar of technological progress.

“This is the first time that France, where copyright was invented, has not defended intellectual property,” Pascal Rogard, president of the authors' society SACD, told Le Monde.

Last month, some 80 unions and organizations representing the cultural sector sent a letter to the government to express their opposition to the French stance on the AI Act.

As these concerns grow, the French AI ecosystem is ready to fight back. Just last month, Yann Le Cun had a harsh warning for an event organized by platform regulator Arcom on what would happen if copyright is enforced for generative AI models.

“I’ll tell you right now, the AI industry stops. It can’t work without it,"" he said.",political

"“He’s the hometown boy who made good, but then he had a tragic end,” Mark Salvaggio, a former Bakersfield City Council member, told POLITICO. “The reaction here locally is sadness, disappointment … but people understand. They respect his decision.”

McCarthy aimed to strike an optimistic tone in announcing his departure, promising to stay “in the fight” even though he’ll no longer be in a position to do much fighting. He can still attempt to recruit candidates and raise money for them, but there’s a big difference between having the speaker in your corner and having a former member.

“It’s going to be hard for them to replicate the operation that Kevin had,” said Rob Stutzman, a top Republican operative in California who has known McCarthy since his time in the statehouse in Sacramento. “They won’t be able to. Johnson doesn’t have the relationships and fundraising prowess.”

McCarthy’s ouster from leadership in October had already threatened to leave Republicans in Biden-won House districts rudderless, especially in fundraising. As speaker, McCarthy elevated the California GOP in both visibility and power.

Without him even in the building, incumbents like Reps. David Valadao, Mike Garcia, John Duarte, Ken Calvert and Michelle Steel could be in serious trouble.

Mike Madrid, a California Republican consultant who makes no secret of his disdain for the Trump-era version of his own party, put it in simple terms: “Investing in the California Republican party is like investing in Blockbuster. The only reason people would was because they had a relationship with Kevin.”

Madrid said the bigger impact could be on the state party infrastructure. He said he expects Republicans will be able to fully fund candidates in battleground races without McCarthy. (Worth noting: GOP candidates currently have more cash on hand than Democrats in seven of the state’s 10 most-watched House districts.)

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to call a special election for the remainder of McCarthy’s term. It would be held simultaneously as the March primary and November general election, meaning the candidates would likely appear multiple times on the ballot.

Potential replacements include state Sen. Shannon Grove and Assemblymember Vince Fong. Neither Grove nor Fong returned messages on Wednesday asking about a bid for the seat, but both released public statements praising McCarthy for his years of leadership.

Grove, one of the more right-leaning Republicans in the California statehouse, received huge recognition this year for forcing passage of a human-trafficking bill that some Democrats had initially tried to block. Fong, who used to work as McCarthy’s district director, maintains close ties to the former speaker, and even called him “one of my best friends” in an Instagram post on Wednesday.

"Sony stays silent as another PS5 bug locks players out of their purchased games.

For several hours on Friday, PS5 owners have been reporting a “CE-107928-7” corruption error when they try to download or update games. It was bad enough that at least one developer acknowledged the issue, and we saw it on our systems, too.

As of about noon ET, some say it’s resolved, and downloads are working again after a console restart. However, just like the issues earlier this week where players were “permanently banned” for a little while, Sony’s status page indicates all is well, its social media accounts are silent, and PR hasn’t responded to questions.",technology
"Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney have decided not to settle.

They met for an hour on Thursday, lead attorneys for both sides told Judge James Donato in a filing (pdf) this evening, following an earlier settlement discussion between Sweeney and Google’s heads of partnerships and product management for Android that was ordered by the court.

“These meetings did not result in a settlement.”

"And in one respect, the court expanded the restrictions, adding a measure barring Mr. Trump from commenting on the relatives of lawyers or court staff members involved in the case if the remarks were intended to interfere with how the trial participants were doing their jobs.

“We do not allow such an order lightly,” Judge Patricia A. Millett wrote for the panel. “Mr. Trump is a former president and current candidate for the presidency, and there is a strong public interest in what he has to say. But Mr. Trump is also an indicted criminal defendant, and he must stand trial in a courtroom under the same procedures that govern all other criminal defendants. That is what the rule of law means.”

But the court cut back on the gag order in two important ways. In addition to freeing Mr. Trump to go after Mr. Smith, the public face of the prosecution, it relaxed a flat restriction against targeting witnesses — allowing Mr. Trump to criticize them if his remarks were not connected to their roles in the case.

After the trial judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, first imposed the gag order on Mr. Trump in Federal District Court in Washington in October, Mr. Trump appealed seeking to get it overturned entirely as unconstitutional. As it hinted it might do at oral arguments last month, the appellate panel instead kept a version in place, but modified some of its terms.

The modifications to the order mean that Mr. Trump can now return to using some of his favorite social media epithets and refer to Mr. Smith, as he has numerous times, as a “thug” or as “deranged.” The alterations also mean that Mr. Trump can lash out in a limited way against those of his political adversaries who also may be witnesses in the election interference trial, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Attorney General William P. Barr.",political
"California has long positioned itself as a stable partner on climate change in the face of national division. Former Gov. Jerry Brown defiantly flew to COP23 to push for ongoing collaboration after Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement. “We will continue to make progress, regardless of who leads our federal government,” Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said on a press call before this year’s conference.

But Randolph said international partners familiar with the U.S. legal system are digging deeper, asking how a Trump presidency will affect California’s ability to meet its electrification targets for cars and buildings — one of the main things California is trying to promote at the conference.

They’re also particularly worried about California’s special permission under the Clean Air Act to set stricter-than-federal emissions rules for vehicles and heavy-duty equipment. Trump’s EPA revoked a California waiver to set its own fuel economy standards, and even after Biden reinstated it, it’s still a live issue: Seventeen red states, led by Ohio, are currently challenging the constitutionality of the entire waiver program before the Supreme Court.

“Some of the folks we work with, like our partners in Canada, for instance, they know the system really well and they’re like, ‘What do you think the Supreme Court is going to do with the Ohio litigation? Is that going to cause issues with your waiver? And then what happens if Trump gets in and then you have a federal government that’s not defending the waiver?’” Randolph said. “They understand the stakes.”

Randolph is optimistic that a Trump presidency won’t happen. But she’s assuaging her international partners on two fronts in case it does:

One, she said, the auto industry has already come around more on the issue of electrification.

Major automakers backed Trump’s blocking of the California waiver in 2019 to set stricter-than-federal fuel economy standards. But they opposed British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s move earlier this year to delay the U.K.'s gas car ban from 2030 to 2035.

“The automakers were like, ‘Wait a minute, we’re planning for this transition,’” said Randolph. “So I don’t think that there’s a lot of support for backtracking on climate politically.”

The second thing is that a lot of California’s climate work happens under the state’s own authority. She pointed to the cap-and-trade program and the low-carbon fuel standard as examples.

She also thinks that the waivers will prevail in court. At a September panel, judges expressed skepticism at some of the plaintiffs’ claims and spent a significant amount of time questioning if they could demonstrate injury because of the waiver.

‘We’re still not in attainment [with clean air standards],” said Randolph. “That’s why I’m hopeful that the courts at the end of the day will realize that this is the fundamental reason why Congress took action and that hasn’t changed.”

"Using a Raspberry Pi to make a robotic dog is nothing new but putting it to work is practically unheard of. The team behind this project created a robotic dog, known as FREISA , that uses AI to determine when a plant needs watering and helps the thirsty plant by activating its onboard sprinkler system. This project was created by a team that goes by B-AROL-O with members Davide Macario, Andrea Podo, Gianluca Teti, Gianpaolo Macario, Orso Eric, and Pietro d’Agostino.

The robotic dog’s name, FREISA, is an acronym for ""Four-legged Robot Ensuring Intelligent Sprinkler Automation” due to its design and function. It works by locomoting using its four limbs. A camera module is used to observe the surrounding environment. Plants are evaluated using AI and watered by FREISA if it looks too dry.

The team chose to start with a quadrupedal robot called the Mini Pupper 2. It’s been upgraded with a camera that can be used to capture images in real-time of plants as it treks through a garden. A Raspberry Pi is used to handle navigation functions for FREISA while the OAK-D Lite camera module handles the AI processing.

In addition to the Mini Pupper 2, some extra hardware is needed. Of course, the team is using a Raspberry Pi—in this case, they opted to use the Pi 4 B. The OAK-D Lite camera module is used for live video capturing as well as neural network inferencing. Some external peripherals are useful to have on hand, as well, like a laptop for programming hardware.

Instead of the popular Raspberry Pi OS, the team here is using Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi. It’s working alongside Docker and OpenCV to help monitor the plants and determine when they need watering. The system was trained on models that enable to recognize healthy vs poor leaf conditions.",technology
"Transcript

[Dr. Emily] If you took somebody from sea level

to the top of Everest,

no supplemental oxygen, no support,

they would be unconscious within minutes.

Everest is a very inhospitable environment.

[Narrator] 100s of people attempt to summit Everest

every year during the small once a year window

that weather allows.

Not everyone makes it.

And 2023 was an especially fatal year.

[dramatic music]

So there are a number of things

that can kill you on Mount Everest.

You fall into the mountain,

you fall off the mountain,

the mountain falls on you.

But because it's the highest

and because people like to check boxes,

it's popular.

I think with more inexperienced people,

that's a problem.

[Narrator] And Dr. Emily Johnston knows.

She's a mountaineering guide

and a doctor trained in wilderness emergencies,

particularly at altitude.

She's summited Everest three times

in each of the tallest peaks in all seven continents.

Starting at base camp,

she'll break down the physical dangers

that climbers face all the way to the top.

So this is Everest base Camp around 17,500 feet.

The molecules are twice as far apart.

You've already lost half of your oxygen.

So 2,500 meters,

that's when you would start to see changes.

So we're well above that here.

So acute mountain sickness is not unusual here.

People do get high altitude pulmonary edema

and high altitude cerebral edema here as well.

People also get GI problems

because there are a lot of people living here.

So it's not unusual

for people to get nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

That's probably one of the biggest problems at base camp

is just sanitation.

And a lot of people fly in

and then come up the valley and get GI bugs.

So GI bugs are a big problem here.

[Narrator] The Khumbo icefall

is a constantly moving frozen river

creating deep and wide crevasses.

It was also the site of a deadly avalanche

that killed 16 in 2014.

[Dr. Emily] The Khumbo icefall

is a steep area of lots of broken ice,

lots of crevasses and seracs.

And the biggest problem here is that

ice will fall on you or you will fall on a crevasse.

It's really difficult because

there's no place to land a helicopter

'cause you need a flat space.

You could pick somebody off with a short haul rescue,

but it's unlikely that you're gonna do that.

[Narrator] No matter what part of the mountain

climbers are on,

proper gear is essential,

not just for staying warm,

but for survival.

Here's some of Emily's essential gear bag.

So here's some of the standard gear

that we use on Everest.

Down suit, it's pretty warm.

Here's some big mittens

and they're so big that you actually wear

another pair of gloves underneath.

This is that harness that I wear at high altitude.

You have this thing,

we call it a crab claw

and it's connected to the harness

and you have crampons,

you know, spikes that you put on your feet.

[Narrator] And some gear can save your life or kill you.

So this is my ice ax.

Pretty standard ice ax for glacier travel.

One of the ways we use the ice ax,

it's not so much...

It's not a walking stick,

it's more to stop yourself.

So what you do is you turn over,

you get in anchor position,

you try to get this into the snow

to slow yourself down or stop yourself.

It is a tool when it's in control.

It is a weapon when it's outta control.

And one of the reasons there's no wrist loop on here

is if you fall

and it's attached to you with a wrist loop

and you lose control of the ax,

wow, that's not a good situation.

[Narrator] Camp three is a 30 degree snow slope

with rocky exposed ledges.

[Dr. Emily] We go up the western Cwm to Camp two,

which is about 21,000 feet, 21,500 feet.

From here we go up the Lhotse Face to Camp three

which is on the Lhotse Face.

One of the big problems going from camp two to camp three

is that's a big jump at a high altitude.

And so maybe somebody

who's had a little bit of acute mount sickness,

they've been kind of ignoring it

and they're like, yeah, it's just altitude.

I don't feel that good,

high altitude pulmonary edema,

high altitude cerebral edema are greatest concerns.

And they're not easy to diagnose.

High altitude pulmonary edema particularly,

it's a continuum of brain swelling.

And this brain swelling is caused by a number of things.

One thing is when your brain gets hypoxic,

it opens up the blood flow to the brain.

And the way it kills you is your brain is a walnut

in a shell, right?

The shell is your skull.

If it swells, it can only go so far.

The only way to for your brain to get out of the shell

is to go down through the bottom of your skull

which is not compatible with life.

That's high altitude cerebral edema,

descent is the treatment of choice.

What happens sometimes though,

you get a camp three, it's super windy,

it's in a dangerous spot,

you can't go down because it's too dangerous.

So then you have to treat them while they're there.

We have to use a portable hyperbaric chamber

called a gamow bag.

It's airtight,

so it's tough if they're claustrophobic

or vomiting or whatever.

And then you hook the pump up

and you pump it up

so that the pressure inside the bag simulates

being at a lower altitude from a physiologic standpoint.

And you have to pump it 10 to 20 times a minute,

so that they get fresh air in there

and their carbon dioxide gets expelled.

You can't just leave somebody in one of these bags

'cause they would suffocate.

Let's give it a try.

We're gonna put you in it.

Perfect, that's great.

So go ahead and lie down.

So I'm filling the bag with air right now

and then I'll overfill it.

And that is what will simulate altitude.

If you're gonna rescue somebody,

you can help lower them

with the straps that are attached to the outside.

You can use them tactically.

Ta-da.

Whoa, how you doing?

[Narrator] Camp four is the last stop before the summit.

[Dr. Emily] This is what people call the death zone.

In the world, there are very few human habitations

above 16,000 feet because you just can't keep up.

Now all of a sudden you're at 26,000 feet,

you're 10,000 feet above that level,

and so things are breaking down.

If you cut yourself, you don't heal very well.

If you get sick, you do not get better.

So you're definitely in the zone

where your body can't keep up.

And on summit day,

from the south call to the summit,

people are driving themselves really hard.

They're typically haven't been eating

and drinking very well.

They haven't been sleeping well.

They're affected by the hypoxia.

They may be hypothermic.

And so this is the most dangerous place.

One, just environmentally,

the atmosphere, there's less oxygen.

And then two, they're tired from this whole process.

[Narrator] Between 1921 and 2006,

56% of deaths occurred during the descent

for people who climbed higher than 8,000 meters.

Getting to the summit is optional.

Getting back down safely is mandatory.

The problem is

there's also this huge sorta catecholamine surge,

people are like, I did it.

I have achieved my goal.

You think you've won the game, but you haven't.

You have to get all the way back down.

All they're thinking about is going home.

They're not thinking about putting one foot

in front of the other,

they haven't been eating and drinking

and they come down and they can fall off.

And it is a long way.

And people make big decisions that are wrong.

Like people will come down a ridge

and they're supposed to go to the left

and they'll go to the right.

People will make poor decisions.

They'll sit down and they won't get back up

because they're just confused.

They just have no idea where they are.

After summiting,

my biggest concern is exhaustion and dehydration.

You know, snow blindness can set in a little bit later.

UV keratitis is the fancy name for snow blindness.

It just means that your corneas are exposed

to more ultraviolet radiation,

then they're accustomed to.

If you are out in this ultraviolet radiation for too long,

it can get to the point where the next day

it'll feel like you have sand in your eyes

and then you won't even be able to open your eyes.

You need somebody to lead you around.

And there are a lot of places on the upper mountain

where you simply can't lead somebody around.

Particularly if you're on above the south call,

like on a summit bid

and you get snow blindness when it...

If it manifests there,

it'd be very difficult to rescue somebody who can't see.

[Narrator] Everest remains one of the safest tall

ultra high altitude peaks to climb

simply because of all the infrastructure.

Despite that there was an unusual amount of deaths

on the mountain in 2023.

The reason we see so many fatalities on Everest

is it's a numbers game.

If you look at the risk of dying on Everest

as compared to something like Annapurna,

it's much lower on Everest.

It's much lower on Everest

than most of the other 8,000 meter peaks.

You get more people on the freeway

and more people die in car accidents.

You get more people on Mount Everest

and more people will die on Mount Everest.

Two is weather.

Typically, if you have a whole bunch of people

going for the summit on one day,

if there are fewer summit days in a season,

you're probably gonna have more problems

because you are gonna have traffic jams.

There are people that are box checkers,

they just wanna have climb Mount Everest

and they're so driven to be able to say that

at a cocktail party in Houston

that they'll just drive themselves to do it.

So a lot of people just want to check the box,

but not everybody.

It's incredibly beautiful up there.

It's as close as you can get to being on another planet.

The sky is this impossible blue

because there's less atmosphere.

So the higher you go,

the bluer and deeper blue that you get in the sky,

and when you get to the edge, it changes you.

And there is something that happens

that I can't describe,

but it's very seductive.

"Biden’s track record as vice president and senator is certainly one of deal-cutter, particularly given his relationship with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Yet, as president, his administration has found success leaving the policymaking details to the legislative branch. Biden’s been burned by getting too close to heated Capitol talks.

The most famous stumble came when a trillion-dollar party-line social spending bill fell apart in 2021. Even so, a significant part of that effort got preserved in the Inflation Reduction Act after Biden and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) fell short on a bigger agreement.

Biden was able to sign that smaller-scale party-line bill after employing a far lighter touch with lawmakers — one that might not work for a delicate negotiation that hinges on pairing stricter border policies with billions of dollars for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

Sens. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) agreed on Thursday to continue negotiating through the weekend. Republicans made a new offer to Democrats, and though there’s no deal in sight, they got close enough to at least bring Murphy back to the negotiating table after he balked over GOP demands.

But if senators can’t finish the job, even the president’s top allies in the Capitol say Biden will need to take the lead.

“If they are not successful, then I would urge the president to get more directly involved,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.)

There’s real worry on Capitol Hill, however, that even presidential involvement might not be enough to save the negotiations. In particular, some senators fear that Biden would be set up to fail after Republicans voted unanimously earlier this week against the foreign aid request because it lacked border policy changes.

Not to mention the primary risk to Biden if he steps in: Republicans could blame him should everything fall apart — and increase their finger-pointing over a migration crisis they hammered him on for months.

On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the bipartisan negotiations on the Hill “should be happening” but said the Republican Party is “not moving forward in good faith.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said that after the GOP’s filibuster he’s “wondering how important or urgent this is” for Republicans.

“It’s hard not to be a little cynical about whether they really want a deal,” said Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.).

Not every Democrat wants the White House to cut a deal with the GOP, either.

Progressives and immigration advocates are frustrated that the White House is even encouraging negotiations over border policies, which they worry will result in virtually eliminating the U.S. asylum system.

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, including the four Latino Democratic senators, as well as Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), asked White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for a meeting on the border talks. The White House has not made Zients available, according to three people familiar with the request.

A White House official said the administration is currently getting updates only from the lawmakers at the negotiating table and providing technical assistance. The official didn’t rule out future engagement.

“I’m waiting to see if a meeting will come to pass but it’s not as though they’re not aware of our concerns,” Hirono said. She wants the administration to identify the “significant” border concessions that Biden on Wednesday said he would be willing to make.

Zients and other White House senior staff have been in regular touch with Lankford, according to a person familiar with the private conversations but not authorized to publicly discuss them. The conversations are not negotiations, the person stressed, with Zients leaving that to his Democratic colleagues on the Hill.

Rather, the chief of staff has been getting regular updates on the state of the negotiations from Lankford reiterating the importance of getting a deal done to help Ukraine. Zients has also held regular calls with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on the same issues, this person said.

In interviews, chief Senate negotiators said Biden’s top aides are involved to some degree. Lankford said the White House is mostly providing “technical assistance” even as it seeks a compromise. Murphy said senators are “in the driver’s seat, but the administration is in regular touch.”

There’s also an acute awareness among Biden aides of how thorny an issue the border is. Progressives fear the administration will go too far, accepting what resembles restrictive Trump-era immigration policies, while getting no Democratic immigration wins in return. Heading into an election year, many of those liberals are already furious with Biden for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the failures to deliver on other campaign promises.

However, many others in Biden’s inner circle believe something has to be done at the border, lest they lose independent and swing voters who have seen surging migration’s negative effects in many major U.S. cities.

The White House has publicly warned that it will run out of money for Ukraine by the end of the year, but some Pentagon officials are hopeful the funding could stretch a little further. Moreover, some senior administration officials believe the Presidential Drawdown Authority may free up some additional funds.

But even with a little wiggle room, the situation could soon grow dire with sweeping ramifications for the war, according to two senior officials not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions. There is growing fear in the White House that a break in U.S. funds would create a domino effect and other nations would also begin to pull back support.

In light of those concerns, Republicans say Biden needs to do more. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a top backer of Ukraine aid, said the lack of progress is “driving me nuts.”

“Where the heck is the White House, do they care about Israel and Ukraine?” Romney said. “It’s up to [Biden]. Does he care about this? The people of the country expect the president to be the leader.”

Still, with a sharply divided Congress stumbling to finish all but its most essential work, Biden now has an opportunity to use his knowledge of the Senate as well as his foreign policy acumen to try for another bipartisan win.

And how he and his top aides handle the next few days could make all the difference in whether the Senate passes aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the border.

“He can get involved,” said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.). “But Congress has to do the work.”",political

I'm Dean Oliver,

former assistant coach for the Washington Wizards

and a statistical analyst for sports.

I'm here to answer your questions from the internet.

This is sports math support.

[gentle music]

First up, @fwh1027,

what is the most efficient shot in basketball?

The most efficient shot in basketball is the layup.

Any shot around the rim.

Getting to the rim not only is a higher percentage shot,

it will more likely get you to the foul line

which players make at about 75 to 80%.

The second most important shot is any shot

beyond the three point arc.

Anything out here?

Shots out here are made at about 35%,

but because of the extra point awarded

for being beyond the arc they are more efficient.

@NBAADED, statistically speaking, who is better?

Jordan or LeBron?

Frankly Michael Jordan was probably

a little bit better defender.

LeBron is a little bit better passer

than Michael Jordan was.

LeBron adopted also the three point shot a lot earlier

than Michael Jordan did, but all in all

they are almost the same.

@Woumaxx asks what studies do you do

to become a sports statistician?

That is a good question.

This did not exist when I was a kid.

Having a career where you get to do math in sports

is a great innovation of the 21st century.

That being said

it's not the easiest thing to get into anymore.

In order to do it, you really need to know sports for sure.

Sometimes people forget that,

but you also need to know things

like programming with a language like Python.

You need to know things about statistics, basic statistics,

or a little bit more advanced that will only help you.

Because this is an interdisciplinary job,

you need to know how to communicate it.

You need to know how to communicate math to sports people

and you need to know how to communicate sports

to math people.

From Ravens_Realest,

what is the most important quarterback stat?

The longest one in existence is the passer rating.

That one goes back 50 years.

It is a very simple metric that just evaluates

four categories of touchdowns, yards,

completion percentage, and interceptions.

It's not great.

A better one is coming from ESPN, which is called QBR

which accounts for what is more important in modern NFL

which is the running quarterback, which is avoiding sacks.

The traditional stat that people probably latch onto

the most is quarterback completion percentage,

Of the more traditional stats

completion percentage correlates the best with success,

but it's still not as good as something like QBR.

@AhnRee_ asks, bro, why are there so many no hitters now?

The bottom line for there being more no hitters is that

over the last 10 to 15 years, batting averages are down.

There are multiple reasons for this.

One of them is the shift.

In baseball they allowed a shift of fielders

to go basically wherever you wanted to.

When they studied the data, they knew that some players

hit the ball in certain areas more

so if you put more fielders in that area, you get more outs.

As of this season 2023,

the shift was made illegal to limit some of the ability

of a defense to shut down a hitter.

The other reason, probably they manage pitchers differently.

The pitchers don't go

and throw a complete game nearly as much as they did

so you're seeing a lot more combined no hitters.

20 years ago that wasn't happening nearly as much.

It was all one pitcher doing the whole thing.

When you have multiple pitchers,

they come in, they're fresh,

they have a better chance to shut down a hitter.

Moving on.

@MaxSportsStudio asks hypothetical,

a player is fouled at the buzzer.

He gets to shoot two free throws.

His team is down by one.

Is the probability that he makes the second shot affected

by the outcome of the first free throw?

First of all, the first free throw is usually much harder.

Players haven't been able to dial in their depth perception.

There's also this thought that their heartbeat is probably

a little bit faster because the action

is kind of calming down.

Usually it's easier to make the ones after that,

but in this situation where the pressure is on,

players do react very differently under pressure

and there have been studies that have shown

free throw shooters who are under pressure,

they do shoot worse by five to 10%.

@CucuyOnline asks does defense really win championships?

In basketball in particular

what you see is that offense carries teams

through the regular season.

What happens when you get to the playoffs

is the best teams know how to ramp up their defense.

They are playing better offensive teams,

but they know how to strategically defend those teams,

take away the best players.

That is the way in which you see

defense winning championships.

Defense doesn't win championships on its own.

Next up, Quora User asks,

how is Messi better than Ronaldo in stats?

The best measure we have for soccer performance

for individuals is goals.

It is not the best thing that could be developed

but over the years that Messi and Ronaldo played,

it is what we have.

@nicky_numbers asks, did you know that former

Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter was a below average fielder?

The numbers prove it.

Derek Jeter was not as good as his reputation

because some of the stats said that he gave up a lot

of extra runs on top of what other shortstops would do.

Won five gold gloves because when he got to a ball

he was pretty good at making the right throw,

making the right read,

but his ability to get to the ball was much more limited.

His range was limited and that mattered a lot.

@Ktwizzle512, how exactly is an NFL spread calculated

and what all goes into calculating the spread?

There is a lot of mathematical calculation that goes

into a spread including what players are gonna be available,

where the game is gonna be played,

whether the weather is gonna matter, wind, rain,

all of those sorts of things.

Who the refereeing crew is going to be.

All of these things have tendencies

for affecting the spread.

That is how an initial line can be set.

But what happens, because the NFL has bet so much,

a lot of the gambling houses,

is they just try to split the pot.

So at the end they're just trying to make sure they have 50%

of the people on one side of line and 50% on the other side.

@elitedawg03 asked what is true shooting percentage?

I've been hearing it,

but what is the official way to calculate it?

True shooting percentage is just total points scored

by a player or a team divided by the shot attempts

they've taken which is a combination of field goal attempts

from the field and a fraction of their free throw attempts.

It's more representative of the actual contribution

of a player because it captures how many points

a player is getting from their field goal attempts.

So if they're shooting a lot from three,

it's capturing that efficiency over someone who takes a lot

of twos and it's capturing their ability to get

to the foul line, which can be enormous for players

like Jimmy Butler or Giannis or LeBron.

@AMiller10 asks when are stupid people going to realize

that pitcher wins are a meaningless stat

that shouldn't be used to decide anything?

A pitcher win-loss record actually tells you something,

which is winning and avoiding losing,

but it doesn't get at all the details very well

for what a pitcher is doing.

It doesn't get at their ability to throw strikes.

It doesn't get at their ability to limit

the opposing team's hitters.

So it's missing important details

but it's getting at something important.

@RellDMC, have running backs ever been less valued

in NFL history?

It is true right now that NFL running backs

are being devalued, probably rightly so,

whether they've gone past where they're getting devalued

too much, I don't know.

The reason they are getting devalued is because

we're recognizing that the offensive line matters a lot

in how many yards those running backs get.

So the credit that those guys used to get as superstars,

they're not getting quite as much of as they used to.

So yes, they are getting devalued and probably rightly so.

Moving on.

@KingDJ_5297, I'm supposed to believe

that advanced stats work for the NBA?

Yes, advanced stats work for the NBA

probably better than other sports.

For instance, there are team offensive ratings

and team defensive ratings

which are how many points a team scores

and allows per 100 possessions.

That is a very accurate representation of how good

an offense or a defense is.

The NFL has maybe 14 drives for a team in a game.

Baseball has maybe 40 at bats.

In basketball, you have probably 80 possessions

where you have the best players able to touch the ball

and able to shoot the ball,

so you get a very good representation of how good teams are.

@dawblack, you can measure nearly everything statistically.

How do you statistically measure an offensive guard?

In football I presume?

In the NFL we have an immense amount of data

that tracks where all the players are on the field

at every point in time,

which direction they're facing and so forth.

With all of this data now you can actually measure how well

offensive guards for instance, block,

how well can they win the block against a defensive player,

keeping that defensive player

from getting either to a running back

or to a quarterback.

From I.C. @nola_legend,

assists are the most overrated stats in basketball.

When will people understand this?

Assists in the NBA are probably given out too easily.

They give them for very simple passes

but they also give them for more difficult passes.

The players who get a lot of the easy assists

are probably overrated,

but the ones who have the passes for the alley oops,

for the layups,

the ones in transition, those are very valuable.

I wouldn't call them overrated as a stat, but I would say

that some of the players who get assists are overrated.

@RZN2BLV asks did Bill James and Billy Beane

change the game of baseball?

Bill James did it by writing a book,

multiple books in fact called the Baseball Abstracts,

which got read by a lot of fans,

and then eventually by people working in baseball

like the general manager of the Oakland A's Billy Beane.

The game of baseball, like a lot of sports actually is about

identifying the best players

and how to put them in the best position to succeed.

What they used is data to help make those decisions.

A particular statistic that they recognized as undervalued

was walks or on-base percentage.

The fact that walks get you on base on top of

getting a base hit is something that was not appreciated

by traditional major league baseball.

They did that behind the scenes

and gained a major advantage.

Next up, RedditUser360 asks what statistics

are most important in the NBA?

It's not things like points

and rebounds and turnovers and assists.

It is offensive rating and defensive rating.

Points a team scores and allows per a hundred possessions.

Beyond that, when you're trying to understand what a team

is doing to be efficient on either side of the basketball,

most important things are what call the four factors

and the four factors are how well you shoot,

which is an effective field goal percentage,

which weights three point shots more than two point shots.

A turnover percentage, an offensive rebounding percentage,

and then how often you get to the line.

Those four things will tell you why an offense

or a defense is efficient.

@VaguelyArtistic, if the triangle is such a simple shape

why can't anyone explain the triangle offense?

I'm not going to explain the triangle offense here.

I can tell you that the triangle offense is successful

only with a couple coaches frankly.

It was successful with Phil Jackson with the Bulls

and with the Lakers.

You are creating good shots for good players and good shots

for even average players who are there to set screens

and just play off the ball

and what it does is it relies upon the strengths

of the players themselves to make decisions.

This is a good one.

@ehoichi, is red zone efficiency a good efficiency stat?

The red zone efficiency is how well an offense does

within the last 20 yards of the field.

Red zone efficiency is useful.

It is predictive to some degree

and it explains the success of teams.

Teams that are very good at it, they will be better offenses

and teams that are bad, they will be worse.

But is it perfect?

No, jst like pretty much every other NFL statistic.

Moving on.

@ItsAColeWorld26 asks what's the most important stat

for a receiver?

Catches, if you're gonna use very simple metrics

are the best representation of a receiver's ability.

It is not the best metric when you start including

the analytical stats.

We have a lot better information on drops for instance,

for receivers, how difficult the catch is,

where the ball was, whether they had to pull it in.

There are better stats for that

but it's a complex series of them.

There's not a simple metric at this point

for overall wide receiver ability.

That's all the questions we have for sports math.

"More than two decades ago, Congress declared that victims of government-caused nuclear contamination who developed cancer and other serious illnesses — including uranium miners and those exposed to radiation from Manhattan Project-era atomic tests — should receive federal compensation.

“The health of the individuals who were unwitting participants in these tests was put at risk to serve the national security interests of the United States,” read the law enacted in 1990. “The United States should recognize and assume responsibility for the harm done to these individuals.”

Now that statute, known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, is in peril, set to expire in June without a clear path for renewal. And an effort to broaden it substantially beyond Cold War-era victims, to others who have been harmed by the aftereffects in the decades since, has run into a brick wall on Capitol Hill.

The Senate voted overwhelmingly in July to attach legislation renewing and expanding the program to the annual defense policy bill. But in the final version negotiated behind doors by congressional leaders, that measure, sponsored by Senators Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, and Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, was dropped.",political
"Apple is reportedly readying new iPads and MacBook Air models equipped with the recently revealed Apple M3 chip for a launch early next year.

That’s according to Bloomberg chief correspondent and persistent and accurate Apple tipster, Mark Gurman, who claimed a ""spring launch"" (so March-May) will come as a move to revitalize iPad sales that have recently slumped. Reportedly thrown into the mix will be a new iPad Air with a 12.9-inch display, alongside revamped Magic Keyboard models and a new Apple Pencil.

NEW: Apple plans spring launch for revamped iPad Pro, new iPad Air (including in 12.9-inch size), revamped Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil and M3 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs. https://t.co/zVvMGmKSubDecember 6, 2023 See more

A spring launch for such a device would make sense. The iPad Air hasn’t been given the M2 chip treatment yet, so skipping a generation and loading the tablet with an M3 chip is rather logical. While both 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models have access to the M2 chip, it would seem sensible to boost them to M3 silicon to ensure the most powerful iPads remain so.

But the more interesting element of the next-generation iPad Pros is that they are tipped to get OLED displays, with the 12.9-inch models seeing a minor screen size boost to a full 13 inches. Rumors around this have been circulating for a while, but the jury was out on when we could see iPads with OLED panels.

However, Gurman noted that according to people with knowledge of Apple unreleased products and its release pipeline, these OLED iPads are also set for a spring 2024 release. This could be one of the bigger upgrades the iPad Pros have seen in some time – while the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s mini-LED display is by no means bad, a move to OLED could lead to better contrast and colors, likely great for professional photo editors and artists.

As for the new Magic Keyboards, Gurman noted they are expected to have a sturdier frame made of aluminum and will make the iPad Pro look more laptop-like. Unfortunately, Gurman did not detail what to expect from a new Apple Pencil.

iPads could get ever closer to MacBooks

(Image credit: Future)

If these rumors come to fruition, the boost in power combined with what could be improved Magic Keyboards with some nips and tucks to make the cover-accessory more user-friendly and flexible may add up to iPads that could truly replace one’s laptop for all by the most niche of tasks. With Apple managing to get true console-quality games running on the iPhone 15 Pro, I’d be excited to see what it could do for gaming on iPads with access to M3 power.

A larger iPad Air also ticks all the boxes in terms of a logical release. There are almost certainly some people who would like an iPad with a larger display for, say, digital artwork, but also don’t need the advanced features of a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. So an iPad Air with a 12.9-inch display seems like a happy medium, providing Apple ensures it’s reasonably priced.

On the MacBook Air side, a move to M3 chips would also make sense. Come next spring the original MacBook Air M2 will be nearly two years old – that’s hardly old in laptop lifespan terms, but it does make the machine ripe for a chip refresh. The 15-inch MacBook Air came out this year, but again, come 2024 it wouldn’t hurt for it to have an M3 chip to tap into for improved performance and efficiency. These upgrades could be aimed squarely at people looking to upgrade from older M1-based MacBooks who may not have been convinced by the uptick in performance that moving to M2-based equivalents would yield.

While a spring launch might sound vague, Gurman noted that the iPads and their accessories are likely to launch in March. The boosted MacBook Air models could also arrive around March. This would also make sense as Apple has previously revealed new devices around that time of the year, but as ever time will tell.",technology
"The best AirPods and Apple headphones are top-quality in terms of sound, performance, features and design. While they typically sit at a higher price range – just like most Apple products – they will give you your money's worth.

Apple headphones used to be synonymous with the flimsy wired EarPods that came with every new iPhone. They did the job, but not particularly well. Fast-forward to today and Apple is a true contender in the audio space. In fact, AirPods are among the best wireless earbuds and best over-ear headphones on the market and since Apple acquired the Beats brand back in 2014 the best Beats headphones are part of the brand's audio portfolio.

After testing every single pair of AirPods and Beats headphones that have been released, we've put together this list for you, noting their special features and specs to help you find the most ideal choice based on your needs, budget and preferences.

The Quick List

If you're keen to cut to the chase and find out which AirPods are the best, you’ll find a roundup of our choices below. You can also jump to a more detailed review of every pick, along with our price comparison tool at the bottom of this post to help you find the best deals.

The best AirPods of 2023

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

The best AirPods for most people

(Image credit: TechRadar)

The highly-anticipated Apple AirPods Pro 2 entered our best AirPods guide in the top spot because they're a significant upgrade over the original AirPods Pro, offering fantastic audio performance and astounding ANC in a compact, wireless, and still very AirPods-esque, design.

The Apple AirPods Pro made waves when they first launched, bringing ANC and better audio to the AirPods form factor. Now the Pro 2 offer much more, including fantastic audio performance thanks to new drivers and amplifiers. There’s also better ANC on-board too which, during our testing, we found to be remarkably effective, blocking out almost all external sounds.

Battery life has had a decent boost over the originals as well. It’s good for all-day listening at 6 hours from the buds and 30 hours from the charging case. The case has been revamped too, with an IPX4 water resistance rating for light showers and sweat as well as a built-in speaker so you can find it if you lose it.

If you already have a pair of AirPods Pro buds you might not be able to justify an upgrade, despite some of the changes. However, if you're looking for the best Apple has to offer, the AirPods Pro 2 are the top option, rivalling many of the top wireless earbuds from the likes of Bose, Sennheiser and Sony.

The best over-ear AirPods

(Image credit: TechRadar)

The Apple AirPods Max were some of the most highly-anticipated headphones ever. Rumors and speculation about what they'd look like and sound like have been swirling for years. So do they live up to the hype now they're here? Well, yes and no.

When we finally got our hands on the AirPod Max we found that, as you might expect, the audio quality was nothing short of extraordinary. The design and build was also solid and unmistakably Apple and they were comfortable too. We also appreciate the use of physical controls as opposed to the voguish swipe controls that most wireless headphones seem to favor these days.

We particularly liked the reprisal of the Apple Watch's Digital Crown, which allows you to precisely adjust the volume and easily control your music playback. What's more, they have brilliant quality of life features for those already devoted to the Apple ecosystem.

But it isn't all good news. The most obvious drawback is the price. Apple has always created luxury tech with a higher-than-average price tag, but these are $549 / £549 / AU$899 and it's still quite hard to find them more cheaply even though they've been out for a long time now. In our review, we didn't think the performance (although great) matched the sky-high price, and we can understand why many would prefer to shop for budget headphones instead.

The AirPods Max also come with a case that automatically puts them into a low power standby mode, and into an even lower power mode after 18 hours. That's useful, but the case itself is exceptionally ugly, doesn't offer significant protection and leaves the headband of the AirPods Max totally exposed.

The best mid-tier AirPods

(Image credit: TechRadar)

The Apple AirPods (3rd generation) represent a big step up from their predecessors in terms of audio performance, connectivity, and design. Features like Spatial Audio support and Adaptive EQ set these buds apart from the competition, while a new, more subtle design brings force capacitive sensors to the true wireless earbuds.

The AirPods 3 are unsurprisingly optimized for use within the wider Apple ecosystem, so Android users miss out on a lot of the extra features that set them apart from other true wireless earbuds on the market. Plus, the lack of noise cancellation means they aren’t the most high-spec earbuds at this price.

The third generation of AirPods is also the one were battery life was extended to the 30 hours that the latest AirPods Pro 2 have since maintained – despite it not matching other rivals in the market.

The best budget AirPods

(Image credit: TechRadar)

The second generation Apple AirPods may have been usurped by the AirPods 3, but they still sport some cool features that may make them worth buying if you're an iPhone user in particular. They've also been given a permanent price cut, making them the cheapest AirPods you can buy.

A lively soundstage and the inclusion of Apple's H1 headphone chip means that the AirPods 2 work really well as a pair of earbuds for casual music listening or making phone calls - just don't expect audiophile sound. The AirPods (2019) also come with an optional wireless charging case means you can use a Qi-compatible charging mat to power the case, rather than sticking a cable into the Lightning charging port in the bottom of the case.

The best Beats headphones

Apple headphones aren't just limited to AirPods. When Apple acquired the Beats brand back in 2014, it expanded its audio portfolio considerably. Today, the best Beats headphones rank highly among our best workout headphones for their Apple smarts.

Best Beats buds overall

(Image credit: Future)

The Beats Studio Buds are rock-solid true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation and support for Apple’s Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos format. They sound great, with a lively sound quality that elevates the highs and lows of your music, and feel supremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time.

They're not without some drawbacks, though. Chief among them is their lackluster call quality and lack of an H1 Wireless Chip. Battery life with either ANC or Transparency mode turned on is a little short at only five hours (15 hours with the case), and their noise cancellation isn’t exactly class-leading, either.

Saying that, they're a very low price compared to AirPods Pro, while still bringing almost all of the same features. That makes them a more budget-friendly option if you want to buy a pair of Beats earbuds – especially now that they recently gained a younger brother (above).

Best Beats over-ears overall

(Image credit: Future)

The Beats Studio Pro are our top pick if you want Beats headphones with an over-ear design. Unfortunately, they lack Apple's H1 or H2 chip, multi-point pairing and wear detection. But there are enough basic features on offer to make them practical for everyday use, like choosing between noise cancellation modes. You also get lossless audio and EQ options, but only via USB-C and not Bluetooth.

In our review of the Beats Studio Pro we wrote that these over-ears sound good and have powerful bass. For Apple users, support for personalized spatial audio and Dolby Atmos provides a noticeable boost, alongside head tracking. Android users get standard spatial audio without head tracking.

The Beats Studio Pro have a simple and sleek over-ear design. They're lightweight at only 270g and fold inwards, making them easy to pack up and put in a bag. The over-ears have physical buttons, which work well compared to some rivals with only gesture controls, but we still didn't enjoy the feeling during our testing. The only issue we had with the design of these nice-looking over-ears is they're quite tight. Yes, you can adjust the fit but we think if you have a head that's on the larger side these might get uncomfortable.

The Beats Studio Pro are a solid pair of over-ears that may not have the bells and whistles of rivals but will deliver good sound and ANC. We also rate the battery life, which is 40 hours with ANC switched off, while there's 24 hours with ANC enabled. This is, admittedly, fairly typical for the price but does mean they should last you the week in most cases, while Fast Fuel gives back four hours in just 10 minutes.

3. Beats Studio Buds Plus The newest and best-looking Beats earbuds Our expert review: Specifications Weight: 5g Drivers: N/A Battery life : 6 hours from buds, 24 hours including the case Today's Best Deals Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Great looks, including Transparent option + Good noise cancellation plus a transparency mode + Configurable on-bud controls Reasons to avoid - Overly crisp sound quality - No wireless charging

Beats went back to the drawing board for its May 2023-issue Studio Buds Plus, making improvements to the call quality, noise cancellation and design of the original.

Beyond ANC, the new earbuds feature configurable on-bud control buttons, Siri voice command support, Find My for iOS and Find my Device for Android. They also support spatial audio, letting you listen in a 360-degree sound field when playing music and movies mixed in Dolby Atmos. There’s certainly enough going on here feature-wise, though the lack of a wireless charging option is a disappointment.

The crisp sound of the Beats Studio Buds Plus should appeal to those who value sonic sharpness and clarity above all else. When compared to other wireless earbuds with a more neutral and natural presentation, however, it seems that Beats went overboard in that respect. Noise cancelling is effective and so is the buds’ transparency mode, so the company hit its mark when it comes to those features.

The Buds Plus also provide a firm fit – four silicone ear tip size options are provided – that holds up even during strenuous exercise, and they are comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. A solid overall wireless earbud option for commuting and exercise.

Best Beats buds for sports

(Image credit: Future)

The Beats Fit Pro are essentially AirPods Pro in disguise: they have the same H1 chip as Apple's earbuds, and that means the same hands-free access to Siri and Spatial Audio in Apple Music. But they're slightly cheaper, and their IPX4 rating means they should be sweat-proof for workouts and running.

We do have a few criticisms. They're not as loud as some rivals, and they seal so tightly that they can start to get uncomfortable after long periods. And while Android users can use these headphones quite happily, they don't get the Apple-specific features of the H1.

If you don't do workouts or other intensive fitness activities these probably aren't the Beats for you. But if you do, these are superb in-ears that stay put and deliver excellent audio and call clarity.

How to choose the best AirPods

How to choose the best Apple AirPods

If you know you want a pair of Apple AirPods or headphones, then there isn't a huge amount of choice. However, there are a few key considerations to bear in mind that should help you pick the right Apple AirPods for you.

The most important consideration to begin with is the design. Do you want a pair of over-ears, like the AirPods Max or the Beats Studio3 Wireless? Or do you want a pair of true wireless earbuds, like the AirPods 3 or AirPods Pro? Some people like the feel of a pair of over-ears, but many like the convenience and flexibility of true wireless earbuds. It all comes down to personal preference.

Next up, which features are most important to you? For example, if you want great noise-cancelling, then the Apple AirPods Pro provide exceptionally immersive sound. If that's not a priority for you, then the Apple AirPods (3rd generation) might be a good option—and you'll save some pennies, too.

Finally, consider whether you definitely want a pair of earbuds or headphones from Apple. As you can see from this guide, Apple creates some excellent audio products, but if you're on a budget you might be disappointed by the lack of options here and can generally find a solid pair of all-rounder buds or headphones much cheaper elsewhere.

How much do Apple AirPods cost? The Apple AirPods 2019 cost $129 / £119 / AU$219, while the AirPods 3 cost $179 / £169 / AU$279. On the other end of the spectrum, the AirPods Pro are more expensive at $249 / £249 / AU$399, and the AirPods Max are the most expensive at $549 / £549 / AU$89. All models are regularly discounted (though not by much) - read our guide to the best AirPods deals for the latest price cuts.

Are Apple headphones worth buying? It depends on what you're looking for – if you want easy pairing with your iPhone, you can't go wrong with Apple or Beats headphones. But if you're looking for pure audio fidelity, you're better off looking at competitors like Sony and Bose, though the AirPods Max sound very good indeed. Because all of the Apple AirPods are more expensive than a lot of their competitors, budget is a big consideration here too. Although we do think most of the AirPods are great value for money, you will find similar audio quality, designs and comfort in headphones that are significantly cheaper. If you know you want to buy Apple AirPods but you're struggling to decide between AirPods models, our Apple AirPods vs AirPods Pro guide should help.

Can I work out with Apple headphones? Yes. The best Apple headphones for working out are the Powerbeats Pro, thanks to their earhook design and sweatproof IPX4 rating. Other models, like the AirPods Pro have an IPX4 rating, but their design means they're more liable to fall out during vigorous exercise.

Can AirPods connect to Android phones? Yes, they can. You might find they're marginally slower to pair than they would be with an iPhone, but the difference is negligible. However, if you are using AirPods with an Android, you'll miss out on features like auto-pause or the ability to customize noise cancellation. That's worth considering if you have an Android phone and you're about to pay quite a hefty price for a pair of AirPods. For more information about how AirPods work with Android phones and step-by-step instructions, read our what non-iPhone users need to know about Apple earbuds guide.

Do AirPods drain your iPhone battery? A little bit, but they shouldn't make a massive difference to your iPhone battery life. When you're connected normally to your iPhone (as opposed to using AirPlay, which uses more power) your Bluetooth connection will use some battery power. However, Bluetooth is designed to be a low power technology so even all-day streaming shouldn't do much damage to your battery life. AirPlay is more demanding because it uses the more power-hungry Wi-Fi to transmit and receive data. The bigger drain on your battery isn't your AirPods connection: it's streaming music from the internet to your phone, especially when you're using mobile data rather than Wi-Fi. If you're finding that you're only really listening to music and your battery isn't lasting all day, you might want to use your music app's offline mode and download the music to your phone rather than stream it when you're out and about.

How we test the best AirPods

We've tested hundreds of audio devices over the years, which means that we know what makes an excellent pair of earbuds or over-ear headphones.

Each of the earbuds and headphones have been tested rigorously for sound quality, comfort, design and, in some cases, additional features, like ANC. We take earbuds out running and headphones on busy commutes, so we can say with authority how they work out in the real world.

In our guide above, we've listed all of the best Apple AirPods. And, because there aren't many models available, most of the Apple AirPods and Beats headphones you can buy today are included. However, that's not because we want to fill up the guide but because all of the products we've listed are genuinely excellent, all offering a brilliant Apple-esque design, solid sound and good features, too.

It might seem tempting to say all Apple products are great solely because they're from Apple. But in the guide above, we've detailed the pros and cons of each product. And we're not afraid to recommend other brands where we think you'd get better value for money, either.

"The U.S. and its European allies are still struggling to cement a fragile deal with developing countries about an international climate-aid fund | Ricardo Tomás for POLITICO

This article is part of the Road to COP special report, presented by SQM.

LONDON — World leaders will touch down in Dubai next week for a climate change conference they’re billing yet again as the final off-ramp before catastrophe. But war, money squabbles and political headaches back home are already crowding the fate of the planet from the agenda.

The breakdown of the Earth’s climate has for decades been the most important yet somehow least urgent of global crises, shoved to one side the moment politicians face a seemingly more acute problem. Even in 2023 — almost certainly the most scorching year in recorded history, with temperatures spawning catastrophic floods, wildfires and heat waves across the globe — the climate effort faces a bewildering array of distractions, headwinds and dismal prospects.

“The plans to achieve net zero are increasingly under attack,” former U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, who set her country’s goal of reaching climate neutrality into law, told POLITICO.

The best outcome for the climate from the 13-day meeting, which is known as COP28 and opens Nov. 30, would be an unambiguous statement from almost 200 countries on how they intend to hasten their plans to cut fossil fuels, alongside new commitments from the richest nations on the planet to assist the poorest.

But the odds against that happening are rising. Instead, the U.S. and its European allies are still struggling to cement a fragile deal with developing countries about an international climate-aid fund that had been hailed as the historic accomplishment of last year’s summit. Meanwhile, a populist backlash against the costs of green policies has governments across Europe pulling back — a reverse wave that would become an American-led tsunami if Donald Trump recaptures the White House next year.

And across the developing world, the rise of energy and food prices stoked by the pandemic and the Ukraine war has caused inflation and debt to spiral, heightening the domestic pressure on climate-minded governments to spend their money on their most acute needs first.

Even U.S. President Joe Biden, whose 2022 climate law kicked off a boom of clean-energy projects in the U.S., has endorsed fossil fuel drilling and pipeline projects under pressure to ease voter unease about rising fuel costs.

Add to all that the newest Mideast war that began with Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7.

On the upside, investment in much of the green economy is also surging. Analysts are cautiously opining that China’s emissions may have begun to decline, several years ahead of Beijing’s schedule. And the Paris-based International Energy Agency projects that global fossil fuel demand could peak this decade, with coal use plummeting and oil and gas plateauing afterward. Spurring these trends is a competition among powers such as China, the United States, India and the European Union to build out and dominate clean-energy industries.

But the fossil fuel industry is betting against a global shift to green, instead investing its profits from the energy crisis into plans for long-term expansion of its core business.

The air of gloom among many supporters of global climate action is hard to miss, as is the sense that global warming will not be the sole topic on leaders’ minds when they huddle in back rooms.

“It's getting away from us,” Tim Benton, director of the Chatham House environment and society center, said during a markedly downbeat discussion among climate experts at the think tank’s lodgings on St James’ Square in London earlier this month. “Where is the political space to drive the ambition that we need?”

Fog of war

The most acute distraction from global climate work is the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The conflagration is among many considerations the White House is weighing in Biden’s likely decision not to attend the summit, one senior administration official told POLITICO this month. Other leaders are also reconsidering their schedules, said one senior government official from a European country, who was granted anonymity to speak about the sensitive diplomacy of the conference.

The war is also likely to push its way onto the climate summit’s unofficial agenda: Leaders of big Western powers who are attending will spend at least some of their diplomatically precious face-time with Middle East leaders discussing — not climate — but the regional security situation, said two people familiar with the planning for COP28 who could not be named for similar reasons. According to a preliminary list circulated by the United Arab Emirates, Israeli President Isaac Herzog or Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will attend the talks.

A threat even exists that the conference could be canceled or relocated, should a wider regional conflict develop, Benton said.

The UAE’s COP28 presidency isn’t talking about that, at least publicly. “We look forward to hosting a safe, inclusive COP beginning at the end of November,” said a spokesperson in an emailed statement. But the strained global relations have already thrown the location of next years’ COP29 talks into doubt because Russia has blocked any EU country from hosting the conference, which is due to be held in eastern or central Europe.

The upshot is that the bubble of global cooperation that landed the Paris climate agreement in 2015 has burst. “We have a lot of more divisive narratives now,” Laurence Tubiana, the European Climate Foundation CEO who was one of the drafters of the Paris deal, said at the same meeting at Chatham House.

The Ukraine war and tensions between the U.S. and China in particular have widened the gap between developed and developing countries, Benton told POLITICO in an email.

Now, “the Hamas-Israel war potentially creates significant new fault lines between the Arab world and many Western countries that are perceived to be more pro-Israeli,” he said. “The geopolitical tensions arising from the war could create leverage that enables petrostates (many of which are Muslim) to shore up the status quo.”

Add to that the as yet unknown impact on already high fossil fuel commodity prices, said Kalee Kreider, president of the Ridgely Walsh public affairs consultancy and a former adviser to U.S. Vice President Al Gore. “Volatility doesn’t usually help raise ambition.”

The Biden administration’s decisions to approve a tranche of new fossil fuel production and export projects will undermine U.S. diplomacy at COP28, said Ed Markey, a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts.

“You can't preach temperance from a barstool, and the United States is running a long tab,"" he said.

U.N. climate talks veterans have seen this program before. “No year over the past three decades has been free of political, economic or health challenges,” said former U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa, who now heads the consulting firm onepoint5. “We simply can’t wait for the perfect conditions to address climate change. Time is a luxury we no longer have — if we ever did.”

The EU backlash

Before the Mideast’s newest shock to the global energy system, the war in Ukraine exposed Europe’s energy dependence on Russia — and initially galvanized the EU to accelerate efforts to roll out cleaner alternatives.

But in the past year, persistent inflation has worn away that zeal. Businesses and citizens worry about anything that might add to the financial strain, and this has frayed a consensus on climate change that had held for the past four years among left, center and center right parties across much of the 27-country bloc.

In recent months, conservative members of the European Parliament have attacked several EU green proposals as excessive, framing themselves as pragmatic environmentalists ahead of Europe-wide elections next year. Reinvigorated far-right parties across the bloc are also using the green agenda to attack more mainstream parties, a trend that is spooking the center.

Germany’s government was almost brought down this year by a law that sought to ban gas boilers — with the Greens-led economy ministry retreating to a compromise. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has joined a growing chorus agitating for a “regulatory pause” on green legislation.

If Europe’s struggles emerge at COP28, the ripple effect could be global, said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.

The “EU has established itself as the global laboratory for climate neutrality,” he said. “But now it needs to deliver on the experiment, or the world (which is closely watching) will assume this just does not work. And that would be a disaster for all of us.”

U.K. retreats

The world is also watching the former EU member that stakes a claim to be the climate leader of the G7: the U.K.

London has prided itself on its green credentials ever since former Prime Minister May enacted a 2019 law calling for net zero by 2050 — making her the first leader of a major economy to do so.

According to May’s successor Boris Johnson, net zero was good for the planet, good for voters, good for the economy. But under current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the messaging has transformed. Net zero remains the target — but it comes with a “burden” on working people.

In a major speech this fall, Sunak rolled back plans to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030, bringing the U.K. into line with the EU’s 2035 date. With half an eye on Germany’s travails, he said millions of households would be exempted from the gas boiler ban expected in 2035.

In making his arguments for a “pragmatic” approach to net zero, Sunak frequently draws on the talking points of net zero-skeptics. Why should the citizens of the U.K., which within its own borders produces just 1 percent of global emissions, “sacrifice even more than others?”

The danger, said one EU climate diplomat — granted anonymity to discuss domestic policy of an allied country — was that other countries around the COP28 negotiating table would hear that kind of rhetoric from a capital that had led the world — and repurpose it to make their own excuses.

Sunak’s predecessor May sees similar risks.

“Nearly a third of all global emissions originate from countries with territorial emissions of 1 per cent or less,” May said. “If we all slammed on the brakes, it would make our net zero aspirations impossible to achieve.”

Trump’s back

The U.S., the largest producer of industrial carbon pollution in modern history, has been a weathervane on climate depending on who controls its governing branches.

When Republicans regained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2022, it created a major drag on Biden’s promise to provide $11.4 billion in annual global climate finance by 2024.

Securing this money and much more, developing countries say, is vital to any progress on global climate goals at COP28. Last year, on the back of the pandemic and the energy price spike, global debt soared to a record $92 trillion. This cripples developing countries’ ability to build clean energy and defend themselves against — or recover from — hurricanes, floods, droughts and fires.

Even when the money is there, the politics can be challenging. Multibillion-dollar clean energy partnerships that the G7 has pursued to shift South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam and India off coal power are struggling to gain acceptance from the recipients.

Yet even more dire consequences await if Trump wins back the presidency next year.

A Trump victory would put the world’s largest economy a pen stroke away from quitting the Paris Agreement all over again — or, even more drastically, abandoning the entire international regime of climate pacts and summits. The thought is already sending a chill: Negotiations over a fund for poorer countries’ climate losses and damage, which Republicans oppose, include talks on how to make its language “change-of-government-proof” in light of a potential Trump victory, said Michai Robertson, lead finance negotiator for a bloc of island states.

More concretely for reining in planet-heating gases, Trump would be in position to approve legislation eliminating all or part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden’s signature climate law included $370 billion in incentives for clean energy, electric vehicles and other carbon-cutting efforts – though the actual spending is likely to soar even higher due to widespread interest in its programs and subsidies – and accounts for a bulk of projected U.S. emissions cuts this decade.

Trump’s views on this kind of spending are no mystery: His first White House budget director dismissed climate programs as “a waste of your money,” and Trump himself promised last summer to “terminate these Green New Deal atrocities on Day One.”

House Republicans have attempted to claw back parts of Biden’s climate law several times. That’s merely a political messaging effort for now, thanks to a Democrat-held Senate and a sure veto from Biden, but the prospects flip if the GOP gains full control of Congress and White House.

Under a plan hatched by Tubiana and backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, countries would in the future log their state and local government climate plans with the U.N., in an attempt to undergird the entire system against a second Republican blitzkrieg.

The U.S. isn’t the only place where climate action is on the ballot, Benton told the conference at Chatham House on Nov. 1.

News on Sunday that Argentina had elected as president right-wing populist Javier Milei — a Trump-like libertarian — raised the prospect of a major Latin American economy walking away from the Paris Agreement, either by formally withdrawing or by reneging on its promises.

Elections are also scheduled in 2024 for the EU, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Russia, and possibly the U.K.

“A quarter of the world’s population is facing elections in the next nine months,” he said. “If everyone goes to the right and populism becomes the order of the day … then I won’t hold out high hopes for Paris.”

"It’s the most wonderful time of the year: when TikTok publishes its annual roundup of the biggest hits, and I get to see what everyone else has been doing on the app all year.

Despite the hold TikTok has on our cultural and political psyche, it’s hard to tell what exactly is going on across the platform. Seeing something served up on your For You page doesn’t mean it’s a thing all the kids are doing — it just means that the algorithm decided you might watch it based on what you spend your time doing on the app. Out of the bottomless supply of videos posted each day, you’re being fed everything from celebrity clips with millions of views to videos from random accounts with zero likes and zero comments. None of our For You pages look the same by design.

TikTok’s list of “top videos and trends” includes a striking makeup look viewed half a billion times; pet videos; fried chicken ASMR; and a Selena Gomez “get ready with me” skincare routine. Here’s a rundown of the top videos in the US, plus how many views and likes each has as of this writing:

Until today, I’ve seen zero of the top 10 videos, and besides Gomez, have only encountered one of these creators. In my corner of TikTok, none of these are viral — we don’t even know they exist.

As I wrote last year when TikTok released its 2022 recap, counting down the top-performing content illustrates just how disparate our individual experiences are on one of the most influential platforms of our age. What I’m seeing on TikTok isn’t necessarily what you’re seeing — and according to this recap, the overlap is slim between my For You page and the net average of all TikTok users. How do we make wide-ranging conclusions about an app where a consensus doesn’t exist? And what counts as “viral” on a platform where anyone can rack up half a million views and it would still be a drop in the bucket of attention and not at all representative of “what’s happening on TikTok”? (This spring I posted a video to TikTok that went “viral” — it has had no long-term impact. All that happened was a bunch of people came across it at one point.)

This ambiguity — and frankly, a generational tension — came to a head this fall after Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7th killed around 1,200 people and took hundreds of hostages. In the weeks following, as a siege on Gaza has left thousands of Palestinians dead, injured, or displaced, attention turned to how many views hashtags related to Israel and Palestine garnered on TikTok. Some said that the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags on the platform meant that TikTok itself was boosting the content. The company countered that looking purely at hashtag views or videos created with a specific tag doesn’t capture the full scope of how people consume and make content.

That context laid the groundwork for the claim that followed: that teens are suddenly really into Osama bin Laden because his infamous and violent “Letter to America” manifesto “surged in popularity” on TikTok. But the so-called surge was actually just a trickle: prior to media coverage and the recirculation of the video on Twitter, a few hundred TikToks contained a #lettertoamerica hashtag, amounting to 1.8 million views, according to The Washington Post. Again, it’s an imperfect metric. How many of those viewers watched for more than a few seconds before scrolling past? Does using the hashtag mean you’re co-signing bin Laden?

The truth is that there are thousands of concurrent terrible takes, niche dramas, and trends happening on TikTok at once, and even with a base of users who are engaging with the content, much of it will never break out to a larger audience. Many people are familiar with “girl dinner” because The New York Times wrote about it, not because they saw it on their For You page. (TikTok named girl dinner as the top trend in the US this year.)",technology

[upbeat music]

Thank you, thank you.

We're here to talk about video games.

So, before I became a special projects editor here at Wired,

I had two different titles.

I was a service editor, which means that I was responsible

for how to make your laptop run faster and stuff like that,

which is fun.

And then I became the games editor.

And because ultimately we needed somebody

who plays video games and I'm talking like,

I'm going to share a secret with you guys,

so none of you can tell.

I have 4,000 hours in Destiny Two. I just checked.

Do you know how many days that is?

Anyway, you're not here to listen to stand up from me.

Let me bring on our panel.

First of all, I want to bring up John Hanke,

the CEO of Niantic, who you may know from such amazing games

as Pokemon Go and Monster Hunter Now,

and my OG that I still have installed on my phone,

Ingress, which takes me way back.

Let's also have Dr. Rachel Kowert come up to this stage.

She's a research director at Take This.

Yay! There we go.

Rachel's a good friend of mine.

We talk a lot about toxicity in gaming

and how it needs to stop.

And then finally, I'd love to bring up Jade Raymond,

the president, founder of Haven Studios,

with a long and illustrious gaming history,

including at Ubisoft, EA and more.

Please, by all means, have a seat.

So, let's get started.

Rachel, I said I would ask you about this.

Tell me about your book.

I didn't know it was the first question.

It is going to be the first question,

'cause I mean, it's relevant to the topic at hand.

It is. So, I have a series of books called

the Psych Geist of Pop Culture,

where you take a psychological lens deep dive

into your favorite fandoms.

I like to call it a love letter to our fandoms.

We're doing a Destiny one.

Yeah.

But the one I just published is about The Witcher,

because if you know me, you know I have a,

I'm going to say healthy obsession with The Witcher

and we just published it, so thank you for mentioning it.

Yeah, congratulations.

Thank you.

So, a lot of your work has to do with

not just toxicity in gaming, but inclusivity in gaming.

And that's the one thing I really want to start

everybody off on is building games and designing games

that are both kind of engaging and player forward,

but also designed for different groups of people

to kind of come together and everything.

And I think both of you have experience in that.

Jade, I really want to start with you though,

'cause you've worked on a number of AAA titles and things

where you've had to think very deeply about

your player base.

And how am I going to market a game

that has data-driven insights,

but also make it inclusive and have those core values?

How does that work in a studio environment?

I think what we like to say is creatively led,

but data informed.

And I mean, I think for anyone who plays games,

you realize that the most important thing about a game

is the story that players live,

not the story that the creators want to live.

So, when I say creatively led, it's not about

really telling your own or having your own creation

lived by players.

It's creating a framework

where players can live their own stories,

their own adventures.

The memorable moments are the experiences

that you have as a player.

So, how do you enable those?

So, that's, I think the way I think about it.

That's awesome. John, let's go to you

because I mean, every single one of

your company's games, right?

I mean Ingress...

I'm going to talk a little bit about Ingress

just because I played it for so long

and I still have it on my phone.

And I remember doing live events

and coming out to an Ingress event

and seeing hundreds, if not thousands of people

just all come together to just have fun.

How does that feel when you are building these games

and you're like, I can get people out into the real world.

Yeah, we try to get our whole company out to our events.

With Pokemon Go, just so many like stereotypes

about who plays games,

and if you have some of those stereotypes,

if you want to see what gamers really look like

or people who like to play games really look like,

come to one of our events.

We had 190,000 people across our events this summer,

the Go Fest events, which we had in Tokyo,

and in London, and in New York City.

And you'll just see so much diversity,

people from literally all walks of life,

grandparents, young people, young families,

couples of all sorts, groups of friends.

It's an incredibly diverse set of people that enjoy games

and see games and something that bring them together

and add a lot of joy and fun to their life.

So yeah, the live events are a core part of what we do

and it's inspiring to see how much fun people have

and what games can do for people.

That's fantastic.

And I mean also let's talk a little bit about

building communities around these games, right?

And I also want to get to Haven Studios

and your upcoming game, Fairgames, right?

And the whole principle there is to create a different kind

of game where the people come together

and play, even competitively

and it's still a very good positive experience.

Can you tell me a little bit about what you guys are

strategizing about how that's going to take shape?

Obviously, you know, we're way out from a launch

or anything, but how are you thinking about it now?

Yeah, we have a really great head of community management

who has tons of experience here named Craig.

And he really has a strong philosophy on how you build

a healthy community.

And there's a lot of similarities between building

a great healthy company with a good culture.

I think it's really having those fundamental values,

and making sure everyone understands

how those values are lived out,

and really being vigilant about protecting

the kind of culture and community,

whether it's in the game or in your studio,

because things can quickly devolve

or quickly go in another direction.

So yeah, we called our studio Haven

because we wanted the studio to be a haven

for people to work.

And we had the same dream that our games,

we're all doing games as service,

are going to be also havens

where players can come together

and experience a different kind of community.

See, that's wonderful.

So Rachel, that leads me to you and your research.

What have you been finding in terms of...

I'll set this up a little bit.

I love this.

There's a YouTube channel called Extra Credits that I love.

And they just did a video about how gaming has felt lonely

these days, and what was it, something like half

of American young people report feeling lonely.

And they feel like the part of the ease of matchmaking

and everything can create very quick games,

but it doesn't really foster great communities.

So, what have you seen in your research in terms of

what developers and also what players can learn about

getting into more inclusive and more, I don't know,

empathetic gaming communities?

Yeah, I think it's what Jay just said about the values

being reflected in the game and community culture.

Games are really powerful because they reflect culture,

but they also create it.

So, if you're getting a quick pickup game,

of course you're not going to feel

a great sense of community.

You're going to be with those people

for a very short amount of time.

But if you're in these longer kind of service games,

or Ingress has been around forever,

and Pokemon Go, that's creating a strong sense,

a long sense of community.

And games are actually very unique at creating that.

As compared to other spaces on the internet,

we see longer, closer, more intimate ties that are formed

between gamers because they're doing something they love

together and it's fun.

It's fun. That's the bottom line.

So John, back to you, because talking about people

who get together and relate and everything,

I still have friends, I mean,

I live in New York City now,

but I have friends in Washington DC

because I used to live in DC,

who were all people that we would get together

and play Ingress with.

And then when Pokemon Go came out,

we would get together and play Pokemon Go.

And I mean, you must see that a lot,

people who not just identify by the community

that they found in these games,

but they feel real, real tangible relationships to it.

For sure, and we kind of stumbled into

building that kind of game.

We wanted to build products to experiment

with new kinds of hardware,

like augmented reality and wearables.

Back when we started this at Google,

Ingress was one of our first experiments.

But what we saw was that by nature of designing a game

that was to be played outside,

turning the real world into the game board,

people ended up getting together in groups to play

and that spread virally.

And what we heard back from players was that

that was a real benefit to them.

It was something that was missing in their lives.

A lot of other technology was kind of causing people to feel

more isolated, and having something that brought

people together with their friends

and was a relatively low cost thing,

you could get together and walk around and play together,

elicited a really strong response.

So, we made it a core tenant of the company.

So, we have a three point mission,

which is to encourage people to exercise,

to explore the world, and to engage in real world

social interaction.

And we incorporated everything that we learned from

that into Pokemon Go.

And you know, I think it's important that

those of us in the technology industry think about

how can we use what we're building

to have a positive impact on the world?

Just before coming on stage,

I was reading the Surgeon General report

on the loneliness epidemic, and it's absolutely true

that it is an epidemic and there are serious psychological

and physiological negative impacts from that.

So, anything that we can do to help people reconnect,

to form and support friendships, to encourage people

to become more engaged with their local community,

those are all positive impacts

that technology can help drive.

It's just a matter of us being kind of mindful

and thoughtful about the kinds of products

that we're building to help encourage that.

That's fantastic.

And Jade, so I want to talk a little bit about

building a studio, right?

Because I have friends who do their own thing,

they're indie folk streamers and stuff like that.

And every now and again, and even in journalism,

we all get, a lot of times we gather together

and dream about what it would be like to start something new

that is kind of focused on our core values.

And that's something you've done not once,

but several times.

What's the process of starting a development studio

and how did you go about it?

Yeah, well I've had a lot of practice.

I got a chance to build a studio

for Ubisoft, TBsoft, Toronto.

I built some studios for EA

and then was part of Google's foray

into building studios with Stadia.

So, now with Haven, I finally got to build a studio

as an independent with some co-founders.

But we really got to take all of that learning

of having built many different studios

under different contexts with different company cultures

and kind of feed that into the way we were seeing things.

And I do think, I like to shine a light on the good parts

of the game industry, and I think there's a lot

of great stuff about working in our industry

with so many talented people.

And so, it's really an amazing opportunity

to get to create this kind of entertainment

that enriches people's lives,

that often brings people together.

And we should be having fun doing it too.

We should be getting together and enjoying working

on these amazing products together.

So, that's the simple vision is how to take

what I've been lucky enough to learn

sort of building studios on other people's dime

and putting that into practice in a studio

with the team that's all co-founding this together

and bring our vision to life of how we want

to work differently.

That's awesome.

And continuing kind of on the business track

just real quick, it's been a tough year

in the gaming industry.

There have been a lot of layoffs.

There have been a lot of great games,

but in many cases we see situations where

a fantastic game comes out

and then the team that worked on it is laid off.

Or maybe a brilliant game didn't reach the milestone

that a publisher wanted, or an executive

somewhere else wanted,

so they wind up having to cut into the team.

That's hard to deal with.

How do you guys view retaining that amazing talent?

I guess I'm throwing it out to both of you, Jade and John.

How do you focus on retaining that great talent

and continuing that momentum,

while also having to deal with like the economic realities

that swirl around the industry?

I mean, I guess there are a couple of things going on.

There was a little bit of a sort of post COVID deflation

I think across the game industry.

There was obviously a lot of hyper engagement during COVID,

and that slacked off a bit as people kind of returned

to more normal lives.

And gaming has become an incredibly mature

and competitive industry.

So, it's just the case that you really have

to bring your A game or your AAA game in Jason's case,

and knock it outta the park with your titles.

And you know, we've had games that didn't work.

We're fortunate, our most recent game,

Monster Hunter Now is doing really well.

And I think we incorporated some of the hard lessons

that we learned along the way into that title.

But that's the environment that we're in.

In terms of retaining and keeping people,

for us it's about giving people an opportunity

to really be at the cutting edge of using technology

to make games that people have never experienced before,

to innovate.

We're excited about mixed reality and augmented reality.

I think we're getting very close to that.

It's been coming for a long time.

I was reading the quote from Nicholas Negoponte

on the Wall from 1993 that said they expected in five years,

I think 10% of the US population to be wearing

[indistinct] computers.

It's taking a little bit longer, but we're getting there.

And so, we are unleashing our teams on building

for this next generation of hardware

and that's really motivating and exciting to people.

Jade, did you want to say?

Yeah, I really agree with what you said, John.

I think ultimately we're in that kind of business

where it's all about the passion.

People got into games because they love games.

And so, if you have a strong vision

and something you're trying to accomplish

that's inspiring people,

that's going to be the primary thing.

The other thing, obviously people care a lot about

who they're working with.

I think maybe when you're starting your career

or early on, you might be more attracted

to having a certain brand on your CV,

but what we're seeing more and more is that

people are attracted to work in a place

with people that they like,

that they know they can count on,

where they know the environment

and the culture is going to be good.

So, that's another reason we invest a lot in that.

And then I think investing in people's careers

is also really important, obviously.

If people feel that they can continue to grow and develop,

you have to invest in those kinds of things

so that people feel like they have a long...

Like they're engaged.

Career. Yeah.

And it's a place where they can grow.

And Rachel, from the other side of the table, right?

What are you seeing from the gaming community?

We all see the news, but there, I mean, people...

Okay, you don't get 4,000 hours in Destiny without

understanding the Destiny community sometimes, right?

So, and I famously tell people that my

just deal with it level for things is really high.

And then you see other people

and they're just deal with it level for things

are really low.

Like, You changed the button,

you changed the key bind for this,

and now it's literally unplayable.

How do you see the gaming public

either maturing along with the industry,

or not maturing in some cases along with the industry?

I think they're definitely maturing

alongside the industry.

Like I said earlier, I think that games reflect culture

but also create it.

For instance, we're seeing a less tolerance for toxicity

and hate across the board,

and it comes out in their actions.

And the bottom line,

players are less willing to spend money,

they're less willing to spend time

in games that are hostile.

And I would say when I first started playing games

in the late nineties,

people were not as willing to stand up to that behavior

and were far more accepting of just,

this is kind of the way it is here.

So, I'm really optimistic and my heart is warmed

that the community really is changing.

And John, I want to come back to you

because so many of the players of all of your games

meet in real life, right?

I mean sometimes they're behind screens,

but more often than not, they're in real life.

I had a nemesis in...

This is an Ingress joke again,

but I had a nemesis.

I live next to a park,

and the park had like eight portals in it.

And for people who don't play Ingress, this means nothing.

But ultimately what I'm really saying is

this park was my territory, it was mine.

And I had this guy who had come through in the middle

of the night and he would take it down every night

and I would wake up, and eventually I realized,

one, I'm too heated about this, I need to sleep.

And then two, I was in the park as the same time

as him one day and I met him and he was just a great guy.

I mean, we just talked, and that's an experience

that only really happens when you play a game

and you meet the other person you're talking to

in real life.

That has to have been something you guys think about.

Yeah, I think gamer toxicity maybe gets a bad rap

because a lot of the interactions happen online.

And I think there's just a general bias online

for things to kind of go negative,

whatever people are talking about.

It's just kind of an unfortunate artifact of that.

That's actually a pretty serious societal problem

I think at this point, well outside of gaming.

I think what's true is that whether it's a town hall meeting

for a community, or whether it's a group of gamers

getting together in a park,

whenever people meet face-to-face,

there's a level of civility, of courtesy,

of respect and openness that you often see.

Maybe not always, but it's just sort of wired into us,

I think, to be more open to real human contact

and to not be as quick on the draw, and as heated,

and nasty as people can be online.

So, I don't know, for us getting out

and talking to our community in person,

I'll go to our events and certainly people will vent

about the UI change that they didn't like.

But it's often couched with how much they love the game,

how important it is to them,

how they've made friends through it.

So, I'm just pro humanity, and pro getting people together

in the real world.

I think it's really important for us.

That's fantastic.

It's interesting though because when you talk to

the new generation who've grown up playing games,

there is no difference between a friend

that they've only met online and played with,

versus the real life friends,

or friends that you've met in person.

So, that is also shifting.

And I think just to talk about a counter example

also from old school gaming,

I played EverQuest a lot when I was...

I was actually working at Sony way back in the day,

my first job out of university.

We got to support EverQuest a bit in terms of code

and then also play it a bit when we were launching it.

And it really struck me, some friendships that I made

in that game when I'd never met the people.

I had no clue what they looked like.

And you could hear through voice chat

different accents or whatever.

But I think also there's a similar power

that games have to break down barriers

that might exist otherwise in life,

and enable you to talk to people and meet people

that you never would before.

And also really question maybe some preconceived ideas

you might have on people,

when everyone looks like an orc, or an elf, or whatever.

It creates a new way to interact with other humans,

which I think is really cool.

And I want to follow up on that exactly.

'Cause I wanted to ask you a little bit about Fairgames

because I mean, it's right there in the name, right?

So, I mean obviously there's the stuff you

clearly can't talk about about a game

that hasn't come out yet,

but I would love to hear some of your thoughts about

how you're building that game to get people together

in a constructive, friendly way,

that is a fair game to the players.

Yeah, I think we don't have a perfect formula yet.

We're still in development, so we have some ideas.

I think a lot of it is creating opportunities for teamwork

and joint objectives,

where the objective is not...

I think so many gas games are purely competitive,

and also shooters.

So, if you can even introduce different ways to interact

and different joint objectives,

and different kind of social situations,

and different spaces where you're not always in competition.

Different opportunities to help different players

create different social structures,

have different types of support of how

not just individuals can express themselves,

but how people can come together and express themselves

as a group.

So, those are the kinds of things we're looking into

and trying to bring to life.

I love that. And Rachel, so,

and again, from kind of our perspective,

we're sitting in front of the screens

and we're playing the games,

do you see the same hunger that I see for people

for those kinds of games?

I want to play with my friends,

but I don't always want it to be about

who got the most kills or who capped that point

that many times.

I want to feel like I'm an asset to my friends

without necessarily having to have the reflexes

that I lost 20 years ago.

You know what I mean?

I'm not that kid anymore.

I mean, I always say in the dystopian apocalypse,

my role will be cheerleader.

So, I'm really here for games that aren't based

on my hand eye coordination.

That would be great.

I think there's definitely a hunger for something,

for something new.

Everybody always wants something new and something novel.

And I just, again, I'm just so excited by the things

that you're saying about thinking about mechanics

to inform the social structures of the players interacting.

I think that's great and I'm here for it.

I think that's really the magic of games is that

there's not just the narrative elements.

There's the messages are carried through gameplay mechanics.

And so, if we really want to own our craft,

we have to think about how all those things to tie together.

But that's what's so great

because that's what makes games so unique.

And you're talking about friendships too,

and how I was saying friendships in games are different

and that they're real friends,

like online and offline is kind of a false dichotomy,

especially when it comes to the social and emotional support

people say they get from their friends,

specifically that they play games with.

So yeah, that's the answer.

One of my best friends is a V-tuber

and she begged me to patch her in on the big screen,

but I'm not doing it.

I don't know if she's brand safe,

but she is one of my very good friends and I've never...

I think I've met her in person maybe once, right?

But she's a ride or die.

If she's called me and said, I need help,

I'd fly to go see her.

And that's real,

those are real relationships we're building.

And actually we started Haven during the pandemic

and it was a time when we weren't allowed

being in the office,

we weren't allowed getting together.

We didn't have an office.

We started remotely with people

and we still wanted to have a way to build teamwork

and a sense of being...

And that happens often through having fun

and memorable experiences together.

That's how you build friendships.

We all started playing Valorant together.

And we were building different bases

and stocking them with things for each other.

So, you'd find little gifts,

and I remember being so touched when one of our programmers

came to save my body somewhere.

[all laughing] That's fantastic.

You feel like someone's...

When you live through those experiences,

you feel like someone's really done something.

Or I do anyways, feel like someone's done something

important for you in real life

and you're like, Wow, that was so kind of them

to go rescue my body.

Right.

Well thank you all so much for this.

Obviously, play Monster Hunter Go.

Stay tuned at Haven Studios for more information

about Fairgames, and buy your book.

Buy The Witcher book.

Buy the book.

It's about The Witcher. What are you talking about?

Thank you all so much. I appreciate it.

Thank you everyone. [audience applauding]",technology
"You could say that Fortnite is entering a new phase. With the launch of Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival, the game is now more than a popular battle royale — it’s a platform designed to house lots of different kinds of experiences. That shift was preceded by an event that brought the game back to its roots with Fortnite OG, which returned to the original battle royale map alongside classic weapons and vehicles. And that was a very intentional strategy from Epic Games.

According to Epic’s executive VP Saxs Persson, the launch of Fortnite OG was meant to create a stir ahead of this rollout of new games. “We had a goal of re-activating a lot of our 500 million accounts that maybe weren’t playing Fortnite anymore, and thought Fortnite was just battle royale,” he explains. “You need them to pay attention to see this is actually very different than what we were six years ago. OG was the first step.” It certainly seems to have worked in that regard; Epic previously said that Fortnite had 100 million players in November, the game’s best month ever.

The second step is this week’s rollout of those three Epic-developed games, each aimed at a different audience. It’s still too early to tell if any of them will be a hit, but early signs are encouraging. At the time of this writing, nearly 2 million people were playing Lego Fortnite, while more than 800,000 were playing Fortnite Festival, both of which had topped the traditional battle royale. Persson says the goal isn’t necessarily to surpass the game’s current main mode, though.",technology

"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has placed a lot of emphasis on the labor market in his drive to bring down inflation. When the demand for labor exceeds supply, wage growth accelerates. That’s good for workers, but it can prompt businesses to raise prices so they can cover the cost of paying or retaining their employees. That complicates the Fed’s push to curb inflation.

Last week, Powell said the jobs market was “very strong” but that it’s “returning to a better balance between the demand for and supply of workers.” This week’s report on job openings in October was interpreted as a sign that the market is starting to normalize. Fed policymakers will meet next week to decide on the next steps on interest rates.

As long as unemployment doesn’t spike and wages continue to climb, White House officials say a slowdown in monthly job tallies won’t have much bearing on how Americans experience the real economy.

“The economy created 199,000 jobs in November, for a total of over 14 million jobs since I took office,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. “On my watch, we have achieved better growth and lower inflation than any other advanced country. A year ago, forecasters said it couldn’t be done.”

So far, the cooler job market hasn’t translated into weaker paychecks for workers. Wages are continuing to climb at a faster rate than inflation — a trend that top Democrats and White House officials are watching closely. Hourly earnings climbed by an annual rate of 4 percent through November.

The annual rate of inflation has fallen steadily since peaking at more than 9 percent in June of last year. With household earnings still accelerating, that’s starting to have an impact on how Americans view the economy.

Consumer sentiment has surged this month as inflation concerns start to dissipate, according to the University of Michigan’s latest survey. Respondents said they expect prices to climb by 3.1 percent in the next year, down from 4.5 percent last month, and there was a “broad consensus” of improved sentiment across age, income, education, geography, and political identification, Joanne Hsu, who oversees the survey, wrote in an accompanying note .

“Many doomsayers were getting ready to confirm their #recession priors,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon posted on X, formally known as Twitter, on Friday. “This #jobsreport confirms that while employment growth has downshifted, we’re not witnessing a retrenchment.”

The Labor Department slashed 35,000 jobs from its September estimate as well, reducing the total number of jobs added that month to 262,000 — adding more evidence to the growing sense around Wall Street that the labor market is coming back to earth.

Through August, the Labor Department’s revisions trimmed an average of roughly 37,000 jobs from its initial estimates.

Erica Groshen, a senior economics adviser at Cornell University and former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, said the consistent downward revisions often reflect that “you’re heading into a real downturn.” Still, the revisions to the initial estimate could be a reflection of declining response rates to surveys the Labor Department uses to compile the jobs report.

Martha Gimbel, a former senior adviser to Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers now at Yale Law School, observed in a research note that a “‘slowing’ economy is not the same as a ‘stalling’ economy.” And despite the downward revisions, a stall doesn’t appear to be imminent.

“Part of the problem that we’re dealing with in this is that everyone wants the economy to just snap back to normal with no transition period. And that’s just not going to happen,” Gimbel said. “We all have to be patient; we all have to sit through this period of real weirdness and real transition in the economy.”",political

[Narrator] Imagine making a sculpture so tiny,

your eyelash is the paintbrush.

Creating pieces in the eyes of needles.

A canvas one third the size of a fruit fly's wing.

That's the daily experience of this man.

My name is Willard Wigan.

I'm the creator of the smallest handmade sculptures

in history.

[upbeat music]

This is more complicated than any microsurgery.

I don't care what anybody says.

You have to have a more stable hand than any surgeon

to do this work.

This one took me a long time. Four months.

Because each camel had to individually put in,

and individually made.

Had to serrate the needles at the bottom,

scrape it away so you got this jagged edges underneath.

And then press their feet into the bit that I've serrated.

If I ever needed psychiatric help,

I think it was probably this one,

because the camels were jumping

and sticking to the top of the needle through static,

and pushing them back down and...

See how thin the legs are?

How did I make those legs without them falling off?

That was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

[Narrator] In truth, every piece is impossibly difficult.

Because they're susceptible

to the slightest of disturbances.

[Willard] I was making Alice in Wonderland.

And when I make my sculptures,

I normally lift them and put them into position.

So when Alice was made, I lifted Alice like that

to sit in the chair behind the table.

And my mobile phone went off and I went, who's that?

And as I breathed in, I inhaled Alice.

Gone. Somewhere in my cavities somewhere. [laughs]

But it was a blessing in disguise

'cause I made another Alice

which was better than the first one.

[Narrator] These tiny marvels require a steady hand.

But also a steady mind,

prepared to weather the microcosmic elements.

Before I start work, I do breathing exercises.

I can feel my heart pumping away.

I can feel myself being really steady. I can feel it.

And once I get closer to the microscope,

all my fingers together, I can feel the pulse in my finger,

and I can feel when it stops.

And then I'll work between the pulse beat. That's what I do.

when I'm working, I am in a state of,

I have to do this right and it tires me out.

Because I may do 16 hours, 17 hours,

or even longer sometimes.

It's impossible to enjoy it

because nobody enjoys holding their breath.

The first step,

I have to cut out a rough shape of what I'm about to create.

And then once I've cut out that rough shape,

I'll go back and I have a look at it.

Then I've gotta turn that rough shape

into what I want it to look like.

And that is a bit where little problems can occur.

I would say 20% I get rid of, 80% makes its completion.

Sometimes I'll make something up in my head

and then it doesn't quite turn out right.

Two weeks into it,

I'll pick it up and say, I don't like that,

and I'll throw it away

[Narrator] To carefully make something

so incredibly small,

Willard needs his own specialized tools.

This one here is a hypodermic needle.

Very fine needle, one of the finest you can get.

And what I've done, I've cut the needle off to shorten it.

And what I do when I'm doing a sculpture,

if I was carving an animal or something like that,

I'd put a piece of material into the hole of the needle

then manipulate it around and slice and separate

the material that I'm carving.

Like peeling a carrot almost.

And this second one here, it's got a little blade.

It's like an engraving tool. Very hard steel.

The third one, it's like a hook and its twirled at the end.

And that hook enables me to manipulate and move

and twist things around.

When you look at it underneath the microscope,

they look a bit crude looking, but they do the job.

This one here is a paintbrush.

My eyelash is stuck on the end of that.

So that's pretty simple.

And this one, this is like a little drill.

So I drill little holes.

So if I'm drilling a hole, I just press onto the material

and I just keep turning it backwards and rotating backwards

and forwards, but very very gently till I make a little hole

if I have to.

This one is like a claw. And what it does, it grabs things.

I can hold things with it and it can pick things up.

It's got this little hand on it that can grab.

You can't buy these tools.

Impossible. You have to make them yourself.

[Narrator] With these small implements,

the scope of work Willard can do is truly staggering.

This one here is the smallest sculpture

any human being has ever made by hand.

This is a little baby inside a hair.

So when I find hair on my face here, which you can't see.

When I shaved it, I went like this,

and in between my fingerprint,

it's the finest piece of hair.

And then what I did, I drilled a hole into the hair,

and then the baby was made from a floating fiber.

So when the sunlight comes through the window,

you see those little fibers floating, I caught one of those.

I had to make a tool so sharp to cut it.

So I smashed up a diamond into little bits.

And it's one of them that I used

to slice the shape of the baby.

This one took me three months to get it right,

'cause it kept going wrong all the time.

I call this one, 'The Beginning'.

[Narrator] Willard's beginnings were not easy.

His talents developing

while facing challenges in the classroom.

Before autism was diagnosed in schools.

Back in the sixties and seventies,

the educational system would neglect kids

with learning differences.

So I'm in autism, which wasn't diagnosed back then.

Kids were sort of left behind, not because their own fault,

because the teachers left them behind.

So if a kid had any talent, you would never know,

because he was discouraged.

But one thing I've learned is I never got bitter,

I got better.

When I was 15, I had a microscope.

This guy gave it to me from school.

And I used to break bits of razor blade off

and push them into a matchstick,

and put a bit of glue on them

so I've got a little scalper blade and things.

And I started getting little bits of toothpicks

and putting bits of metal into the end

and holding things down and slicing.

And as I got older, I started to evolve.

55 years of doing this, I'm now 65.

So my whole life, my whole body has been trained.

That's the dedication that I have.

[Narrator] Willard's dedication makes him always strive

for perfection in his work.

The emotional process is when it goes wrong, I'm pissed.

And then I sit down and I...

You know, it's not what you do when you get knocked down,

it's what you do when you get back up.

So if I get knocked down with something,

I get back up and then I find out why I got knocked down,

why it didn't work, and I'll do it again,

and I'll just keep going till I get it right.

[Producer] How do you feel when you complete a piece?

It's like climbing a mountain. Mount Everest.

You get to the summit and it's like...

You see, my pleasure is looking at other people,

you know, seeing their reaction.

To know that inside the eye of a needle

has opened up the biggest world to people.

[Narrator] Among these people entranced by Willard's work

was Queen Elizabeth II.

Most proudest moment of my life.

I had a letter from Buckingham Palace

saying she'd accept my tiny microscopic crown.

The Queen came out and it was in a beautiful microscope,

especially made for her.

I took it there and showed it to her.

She says, this is fantastic. It's so special.

I've never had something so small that's so special.

Thank you very much. Shook my hand.

And I walked away thinking the alarm clock was gonna go off

thinking I'm gonna wake up.

[Producer] What do you hope people take from your work?

Well, I hope they see small things in a much bigger way.

They look at life different.

If you see anything and you can help the person.

If you see a little bee on the floor when he's walking,

pick him up, put him somewhere safe.

There's kids out there with autism.

Take time to listen to them, understand them,

'cause they're diamonds in a dust bin.

Take the lid off the bin and see what's in there.

What society seems to throw to one side,

and they'll realize they made a big mistake.",technology
"MSI Japan apologizes for pump issues on its MAG Coreliquid E-series AIO liquid cooling product line. The company is now offering customers the choice of a refund or a replacement (via Hermitage Akihabara). The faulty pumps are much louder than designed, and the issue exists in four of MSI's AIO liquid coolers.

The impacted coolers are the MAG Coreliquid E240 240mm and the larger MAG Coreliquid E360 360mm models, including the white variations of both coolers for four affected models. The MAG Coreliquid E lineup came out earlier this year, and when we reviewed the MAG Coreliquid E360, we didn't see any pump issues. However, the problem appears widespread enough for MSI Japan to take action.

MSI Japan was scant on the details, but its press release (translated by Google) stated, ""When some pumps operate in the 1,600 to 1,800 RPM range, the internal impeller contacts the cavity."" It seems like this is more of a quality control issue than something that impacts all pumps for these liquid coolers. Curiously, MSI had implemented a three-phased motor for the MAG Coreliquid E-series coolers that seemingly helped minimize vibrations.

What's a little strange about all of this is that MSI Japan is the one that made the press release, not MSI in general. The MAG Coreliquid E series is sold outside Japan, but it is uncertain if the faulty units are limited to a specific batch sold in the Japanese market. Strangely, MSI itself or other regional branches haven't made a similar press release, though perhaps there are plans to do so. If you're noticing unusual pump noises coming from your pump, you should contact MSI directly to have the problem solved.

This wouldn't be the first time MSI has had to replace customers' AIO coolers. In 2022, the company recalled some MAG Coreliquid R coolers with blockage issues. In that case, the recall was posted on the U.S. version of MSI's website and offered only replacements, with no refund option.",technology

Like most of the best organic mattresses, Avocado's beds sit in the premium price bracket, and offer excellent quality and high-end materials. Discounts are fairly regular, but definitely worth taking advantage of.

Avocado doesn't always have a sale on, but when it does it switches between blanket money-off deals and 10% off discounts (like this one). Based on queen sizes, the price is about the same on both deals, but smaller sizes are cheaper with the former.

We rate Avocado as one of the best mattress brands in the US, partly because of its high-quality, certified organic materials, and partly because its mattresses provide top comfort and support. Avocado also provides a one-year free trial and free returns, plus a 25-year warranty. Read on to find out about the current Avocado mattress discounts.

Today's best Avocado mattress deals

Avocado Green mattress: was $1,399 now from $1,259 at Avocado

Avocado's flagship model is its most popular. This hybrid includes layers of latex and coils, the former being split into zones to ensure you stay properly aligned. It's needle-tufted by hand, rather than being glued. The standard version (which we talk about in depth in our Avocado Green mattress review) has a firm feel and is 10% off all sizes in the current sale (queen drops to $1,799). Alternatively, you can pay extra to add a pillow-top to take it into medium territory, or a box-top to make it plush. The latter unlocks a 20% discount.

Avocado Vegan mattress: was $1,399 now from $1,259 at Avocado

For strictly vegan shoppers, this PETA-approved model swaps wool for cotton, so there are no animal products involved. The Avocado Vegan mattress is made with GOLS organic certified latex and up to 1,414 tempered steel coils, delivering the perfect balance of firmness, comfort and support. With 10% off the standard version, a queen size costs $1,799. Again, you can add a pillow top to make it softer, or opt for a box top to bump the discount up to 20% off.

Avocado Eco Organic mattress: was $777 now from $699 at Avocado

The eco organic is the most affordable option in the Avocado Green lineup, and great if you want an organic mattress but don't have loads of cash to splash. It features a pared-pack design with coils, a thinner layer of latex with two support zones. It's 9 inches tall and has a medium sleep feel, which means it's better suited to lighter or average weight sleepers. With 10% off all sizes, a queen will set you back $1,169.

Avocado Luxury Organic mattress: was $3,099 now from $2,789 at Avocado

The fanciest of Avocado's mattresses has an impressive 17 layers, including organic latex, alpaca, wool, silk, hemp and individually wrapped coils arranged in five zones for support and motion isolation. The standard version has a medium feel, and 10% off all sizes in the current sale (so a queen size drops to $3,509). Upgrade with a pillow-top to make it plush, or a box-top to make it ultra-plush – both of those cost extra, but the latter is eligible for a 20% discount. Note, there's no twin size option.

Avocado Latex Mattress: was $2,399 now from $2,159 at Avocado

This hand-crafted organic mattress is great for comfort and motion isolation, with just the right amount of bounce. This model toggles between being on the clearance sale and not, which is a little suspicious. The current sale knocks 10% off, which is absolutely not the cheapest it has been, but who knows if it's sticking around or not?

Which Avocado Green mattress should I choose?

Every mattress in the Avocado range is certified organic and non-toxic, and they all come in a range of sizes; usually from twin to Cal king, although the Avocado Latex Mattress can be bought as a split Cal king, the Luxury Organic Mattress can be had in a split king size, and its Eco Organic Kids Mattress is available from twin to full size. Avocado's crib mattresses only come in one size. And beyond sizing, there are some big differences across the Avocado range.

The Eco Organic Mattress (priced from $799 when not in a mattress sale) is the cheapest in the range, offering a Medium level of comfort that suits back, stomach and side sleepers alike. Slightly more expensive, the Avocado Green Mattress (priced from $1,399) comes in two versions: the Standard (Medium Firm) is a great choice for back and stomach sleepers, as well as average to tall side sleepers. The softer Pillow-Top variation suits side and combination sleepers, along with those who require more pressure relief. You get the same choice with the Avocado Vegan Mattress (priced from $1,399), which is a vegan-certified and PETA-approved hybrid.

For the ultimate in motion-isolating support, try the Avocado Latex Mattress (priced from $2,399). This was previously the company's most expensive option, but it's now been superseded by the Avocado Luxury Organic Mattress (priced from $2,799), which packs in 17 layers of organic and natural latex, wool, silk, hemp, and cotton, plus up to 3,136 pocket coils for support and motion isolation.

Does Avocado do a Black Friday sale?

The Black Friday mattress deals and Cyber Monday mattress deals traditionally being with them the lowest prices of the year. So what does the Avocado Green Black Friday sale look like?

Based on historical deals patterns, we expect Avocado will run one of its regular deals over Black Friday – so either a blanket money-off deal, with discounts tiered based on price, or 10% off everything (these tend to equate to roughly the same pricing – although the money-off deals tend to work out better on smaller sizes.

Avocado Black Friday deals: Price history

In 2023, Avocado offered $200 of most of its models, rising to $400 off if you opted to upgrade to the priciest box-top options. This was one of two regular deals we saw throughout the year, rather than being anything particularly special for Black Friday.

In 2022, Avocado kicked off a 10% off deal across its full site at the end of October – albeit without any Black Friday branding – and it ran all the way into Cyber Monday. It wasn't as underwhelming as it looked though, because over Black Friday weekend proper, the brand added an extra discount on its flagship model (the Avocado Green) as well as the Vegan version. Shoppers could then then apply the 10% off to the discounted price.

In 2021, the Avocado offered a $150 discount on its Avocado Green and Avocado Latex models, and a massive $350 reduction on the Organic Luxury. The year before that, customers could make savings of $200 on the Avocado Latex and Luxury Organic Crib mattresses. Both of those Avocado Green mattress sales also included discounted bedding and furniture.",technology

"Transcript

I'm Jeffrey Hazboun,

I'm a physicist.

Let's answer some questions off the internet.

This is Physics Support.

[upbeat music]

@PAzaz91 asks,

how do black holes influence the space-time around them?

Anything that's massive will bend space-time.

So if I think about this sheet of elastic

as being space-time with nothing in it,

as soon as I put something that has any mass in there,

it bends space-time around it.

If I then take something really small like this marble

and give it a little bit of oomph,

it'll orbit around that object.

And it's that following curved space-time

is why the earth moves around the sun.

So if I have a really big object

and I look at what that looks like in space-time,

that bends it even more.

The key with a black hole is making something

that's really, really dense,

and as I increase that density,

that stretches the space-time further and further

and further down,

so much that light can't escape that curvature anymore,

and that's what we call a black hole.

@petalsforjack asks,

wait, what's space-time?

Space-time is the thing that we live in.

It is four dimensions,

three dimensions of space

and adding to that the dimension of time.

It's what we're moving through as we sit still,

it's what we're moving through as we walk through our house.

@FrvnkieSmacks asks,

how do you split an atom?

What you're really doing is you're splitting the nucleus.

And let's say this is the nucleus of a uranium atom,

and what you do is you shoot another particle at it,

usually a neutron,

really, really fast.

And when you shoot it at the nucleus,

the nucleus breaks into pieces,

into a few different pieces that are smaller nuclei.

And when you do that,

it also, as you can see, releases a lot of energy,

and that's where the first nuclear bombs came from

and that's where the energy we get

from nuclear power comes from.

User alir8203 asks,

if the sun just suddenly disappeared,

it would take us eight minutes to find out.

But does earth still orbit where the sun was,

or will it go out of the orbit

immediately after it disappeared?

The answer is it's gonna keep moving around the sun

for another eight minutes.

We don't know here on earth that the sun disappeared

because it takes eight minutes for the light

to get to us from the sun.

It also takes eight minutes for any changes in gravity

to get from the sun to us.

@Mike_Bianchi asks,

hasn't read a God-damned thing about physics

since high school.

Hey, did you hear about the gravitational waves?

I have heard about the gravitational waves

and I helped publish some of the recent results

about gravitational waves.

In case you haven't been paying attention,

gravitational waves are these expansions

and contractions of space-time

that are traveling through space-time at us

from super massive black holes

at the centers of faraway galaxies.

One of the really neat things about gravitational waves

is they pass unimpeded through the universe.

We can actually get closer to the Big Bang

using observations of gravitational waves.

So they're gonna teach us all kinds of neat stuff

about the early universe.

@only1_66 asks,

one question,

how do you detect gravitational waves in space-time?

The first way we detected gravitational waves

a few years ago was using lasers in big vacuum tubes.

And you split a laser,

you shoot it down two tubes,

and you keep track of how far apart the mirrors are

using the lasers

to tell you the distance between the mirrors.

That's called LIGO.

The second way that we've learned

to detect gravitational waves

is by using these exotic stars called pulsars.

They are really fast spinning stars

that pulse every time they come into our line of sight.

We watch those pulses over time,

if the pulses arrive a little bit later

or a little bit earlier,

we can attribute that to the expansion

and contraction of space-time between us and those stars.

I'm part of a collaboration

that looks at almost 70 of these stars

in all different directions

and we've been monitoring it for almost 20 years.

@thetarekhatib asks,

I'm genuinely paying you $1,000 if you answer this right.

Is light a wave or a particle?

The answer is that light is both a wave and a particle.

We've known the wave-like properties of light

for a long time.

There's a classic experiment

called the Young's double-slit experiment.

Let's show it to you right now.

Let's take down the lights.

We're gonna take a laser pointer here,

which is not how the original experiment was done.

I'm just gonna take this plate

that has a little tiny slit in it

and point the laser through it.

And what happens is it splits the light

into two different waves

and those waves are a little separated from each other.

They're not quite matched up

because two different waves are meeting up with each other,

and this is what we call interfering,

and that's what gives us that pattern.

There's actually two waves hitting there

and they're constructively interfering.

So the black spots are actually the same

as what you get in noise-canceling headphones.

One of the waves is canceling out the other wave,

and only a wave behaves like this.

Lights, please.

Light is actually something bigger

than a wave or a particle,

it's something we call a quantum field

and that quantum field has particle-like characteristics

and wave-like characteristics,

and we can measure both.

So I think you owe me a thousand bucks, dude.

@Dr_Z_GCDisney asks,

what's the difference between fission and fusion anyway?

Do you wanna go fission with me?

I don't want to be anywhere near where fission is happening.

Fission is where you take a nucleus

that's really big of an atom and you break it into pieces.

Fusion is where you take pieces of atoms

and you push them together to make something bigger.

Fusion is what happens in the sun

where really small nuclei come together,

and that is a huge explosion.

And we've been trying to build something like that on earth

to make energy,

we haven't been able to figure out how to control it yet.

Shivanshu21212 asks,

how will the universe end?

The universe will end in the heat death of the universe,

which just means that over time the universe is expanding

and all of the light that we know about

is going to get degraded and absorbed by black holes.

It just gets really cold and really dark.

We won't be able to see anything in the distance

and just nothing.

The heat death of the universe

is not something to worry about

because it's gonna happen 40 to 50 billion years

in the future,

and we're only about 14 billion years

from the beginning of the universe.

@ClwnPrncCharlie asks,

wait, are black holes/wormholes actually spheres?

Watching Interstellar.

Black holes are pretty much perfect spheres.

If they're spinning,

they are a little bit more expanded around their equator

where they're spinning than at their poles,

but pretty much spheres.

So in that classic image from Interstellar,

you see this pretty much spherical black hole at the center

and then you see all of this light,

which is the light from the other side of the black hole

getting bent around it.

And that disk that you see across the front,

that tells you that the black hole is actually spinning.

And every black hole that we know of is spinning,

like every other star in the universe.

@52xmax asks,

what's so special about special relativity?

Well, that's relative.

Einstein, probably.

Special relativity is special for a few reasons.

Number one, it gives us a universal speed limit,

which is the speed of light.

Nothing can go faster than the speed of light,

and that's unique to Einstein.

He figured this out in 1905

and no one had really thought

that there was any kind of universal speed limit.

Couple other things that are really special

about special relativity are that it tells you

if you're moving close to the speed of light,

time dilates, it gets longer.

So if you're moving really fast,

you experience time more slowly

than someone who's not moving really fast.

@cowboyvard asks,

can someone explain the twin paradox to me in simple terms?

You have two twins, both on earth,

one of the twins decides to be an astronaut.

She takes off in a spaceship going super fast,

almost the speed of light.

It takes her 50 years to go out to a star and come back.

When the astronaut comes back,

the twin that remained,

she's 50 years older,

the other twin might only be 20 years old

depending on how fast she was going.

And so it's the person in the rocket

that will see time move more slowly

and will only age 20 years.

@ayresforce1 asks,

the speed of light as constant is falsehood.

What's the speed of light in water?

Slower?

The speed of light as a constant is not a falsehood.

We have a glass of water

and I'm gonna put this pencil in there.

And when I put the pencil in,

the pencil looks bent,

the light that's coming out that you're seeing is bent.

And that bending comes from the fact

that as the light hits it at some angle,

it sort of veers in that direction.

The light's interacting with the water,

it's getting absorbed and remitted.

It's seeing a little bit longer path as it gets scattered,

and it's that that makes the light look like it's bent,

those interactions take a little bit of time,

and that's why we say

that it's effectively moving more slowly.

Between one interaction and the next,

the speed of light is the speed of light.

@aquariusdonkek asks,

the question is, how does time dilation work?

Long story short,

time dilation is the fact

that when you're moving really close to the speed of light,

time passes more slowly.

It's pretty simple to write down.

The time that passes for someone who's moving at some speed

is proportional to how time is passing

for someone who's not moving at that speed.

And there's this funky square root down here.

And what matters is the comparison

of how fast that person's moving,

that's what V is,

as compared to the speed of light.

And in that line there.

And as you go faster and faster and faster,

that factor of delta t prime gets longer

and longer and longer,

so time is passing more and more slowly.

When you get to the speed of light,

time no longer passes.

@neilcameron78 asks,

are black holes really wormholes?

Or are wormholes really black holes?

Eh, eh?

#science.

We know black holes exist.

We can see evidence for them out there.

We've seen light around these black holes

and what it looks like.

We've seen the silhouette of a black hole.

Wormholes are a shortcut through space-time

from one place to another.

The first idea of a wormhole

is something called an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

It would take moving faster than the speed of light

to travel through.

And we have no evidence whatsoever that wormholes exist.

Some physicists have posited

that if we use some of the special characteristics

of quantum field theory,

that maybe we can create tiny, tiny little wormholes

that we can send a signal through

from one place in space-time to another.

And while these have been successful as thought experiments

and successful as computer simulations,

it's not yet been seen in the real world

in a real-life experiment.

@MATTP1949 asks,

you think time travel is possible

under current physics understanding?

No, probably not,

at least not from what we understand right now.

There's a couple of ways to think about

how we might travel in time.

One way is using a wormhole.

Some physicists have done this thought experiment

and written down all of the pieces you would need.

So you build a wormhole that somehow changes

and tunnels through space-time back into the past.

You write down the math for what that wormhole looks like.

The kind of matter that you would need

to hold that wormhole open

doesn't exist in our current understanding of physics.

The type of matter that you would need

to hold a wormhole open is called exotic matter,

things like negative energy density,

which what does that mean?

It means like thinking of something with negative mass.

So I don't know

if we're going to be building a time machine anytime soon

unless we can figure out how to find

and make this exotic matter.

Brad_alexandru asks,

is there anything infinite in the real world,

or is infinity just a concept in our mind?

Infinity is not just a concept in our minds.

The most important infinity that I study

is that the universe is infinite.

So that's a great example of something that's infinite.

We use infinities all the time

when we're making predictions in physics,

and it turns out that the size of the universe is infinite.

The amount of time the universe will be around

is also infinite.

@OneDayWellBeOk asks,

quick question,

does anybody know the difference between particle physics

and quantum physics, please?

Particle physics is a small part of quantum physics.

And quantum physics is the area of physics

that really studies small stuff

and the interactions on really, really small scales,

but particle physics focuses on the particles

that make up atoms,

the fundamental particles that make up everything around us.

@Cipher707 asks,

I thought quantum physics was a fanfic.

Absolutely not.

Quantum physics is how the world works,

but you have to look at a really small scale

to understand what's going on.

If I throw a ball up in the air,

it comes down back into my hand,

that's classical physics.

Quantum physics acts in surprising ways.

So instead of having pure predictions

about what's gonna happen at a quantum level,

we just get probabilities.

There's a 50% chance that this thing is gonna happen,

a 20% chance that this other thing is going to happen.

If you watch a lot of Marvel movies,

I could see why you'd think it was fanfic,

because it gets used anytime you don't know

how to explain the science that you wanna do.

@ravenbiter asks,

lecturer just asked what Heisenberg contributed to physics

and loads of people answered crystal meth.

That's a different Heisenberg.

The Heisenberg that we know

is a very famous quantum physicist.

He worked with the German government during World War II,

but he's really well known for being one of the people

who figured out all of these rules of quantum mechanics

really early on.

He came up with something called the uncertainty principle.

Basically, if I know one aspect of a particle,

like where it is,

I can't know how fast it's moving very well,

or if I know how fast it's moving,

I can't know where it is.

@tim_amburgey asks,

I just learned about quantum entanglement and I'm shook.

How can two particles be so connected

that they affect each other

even when they're light-years apart?

Is this the secret to long-distance relationships?

#quantumlove.

Two particles light-years apart can absolutely be connected

if we've set them up in a entangled state.

And what that means is we take two particles

where the measurement has something to do with chance.

So if I roll this dice,

whatever value I get on that face,

I'm gonna get the same value on the other dice

if that's how I've set up the entangled system.

And these two particles can be very, very far apart

from each other.

And this is just how nature works.

The weird part about this is the chance

that no matter how I roll the dice,

whatever it lands on,

the other dice will land on the same exact value.

This is just a fundamental way about how the universe works.

@u_tibi asks,

what the hell does the Large Hadron Collider do anyways?

The Large Hadron Collider

is the largest particle accelerator in the world.

It is a huge 10-kilometer circle in Switzerland

where we take two streams of protons.

Protons are a kind of hadron,

hadrons are really heavy particles.

Takes those two streams of protons

and aligns them just right,

they're going almost the speed of light,

not quite, but almost the speed of light,

and smashes them into each other.

The faster you can get those protons to go,

the more stuff comes out of that explosion

when you smash 'em together.

We're making new particles that we haven't seen before.

They're part of nature,

but they take so much energy to make

that they haven't been around since the Big Bang

when the universe was really tiny

and really, really energetic.

So not only are we learning about these fundamental forces,

we're also learning about physics

right at the beginning of our universe.

@PhysicsInHistory asks,

is string theory really a dead end?

No, it's not a dead end.

String theory is a theory that says,

instead of the fundamental pieces

of the universe being particles,

they're strings.

And these strings can vibrate in different ways.

You can have strings that are long,

you can have strings that are in loops.

And not only does it describe all of particle physics

and quantum mechanics,

some pieces of this actually predict

what quantum gravity would look like,

gravity on a really small scale,

which is not a theory that we have right now.

So those are all the questions for today.

Thanks for such insightful questions.

Casino Royale

More grit, no gadgets—that was the simple formula that ultimately saved the Bond franchise with this soft reboot of the long-running series of spy thrillers. Stepping away from the camp factor that had largely dominated since Roger Moore's turn as 007, Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond reimagined him as less a dashing superspy and more the flawed, violent, dispassionate government operative of Ian Fleming's novels. Fittingly, it's the first of Fleming's novels that provides the basis for this reinvention, with a newly promoted Bond hunting down Le Chiffre, financier to global terrorists, and the fate of the world hinging on a game of poker with the highest possible stakes. Craig's time as Bond is now done, but his debut remains a high point for the entire series.

The Burial

Courtroom dramas are rarely laugh riots, but this tale of funeral home director Jeremiah O'Keefe (Tommy Lee Jones) and his flashy lawyer Willie Gary (Jamie Foxx) taking on a major player in America's ""death care"" system manages to bring a dark sense of humor to already grim proceedings. This is no comedy though—based on true events, director Maggie Betts' (The Novitiate) latest drama retells a real-life legal case that exposed massive inequality in funereal care, and how Black communities were regularly being overcharged. Foxx and Jones are in top form throughout, but it's Jurnee Smollett as Mame Downes, Gary's rival attorney who threatens to out-pace him at every turn, whose performance threatens to steal the whole movie. For a film about death, The Burial ultimately proves warmly life-affirming.

A Million Miles Away

Charting the life of José Hernández, this biopic—based on Hernández's own book—mixes the aspirational with the inspirational as it follows its central figure's rise from, in his own words, migrant farm worker to the first Mexican-American astronaut. Michael Peña is in fine form as Hernández, painting a picture of a man almost myopically driven to reach space, no matter the cost, while Rosa Salazar impresses as his wife Adela, refusing to fade into the background even as she puts her own dreams on pause for José to chase the stars. In lesser hands, this could all be cloying; a twee tale of hard work and achieving the American Dream, with a dash of NASA promo material on the side, but director Alejandra Márquez Abella has her lens as focused on the small beauties of life here on Earth as the splendor and sheer potential of space. A rare delight.

Red, White, and Royal Blue

Look, this is clearly a ""best film"" by a highly specific metric—and that metric is “gloriously cheesy trash.” Adapted from Casey McQuinston's best-selling novel, this intercontinental rom-com charts the relationship between First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine), the ""spare"" to the British throne, going from rivals through to grudging respect, and ultimately groundbreaking romance. It's often ludicrous, including an inciting incident seeing the pair falling into a wedding cake, a tabloid-worthy tryst in a hotel room, and political intrigue surrounding Alex's mother, President Ellen Claremont (Uma Thurman, vamping scenes with a bizarre ""Texan"" accent), but it's all just irresistibly wholesome and upbeat. Red, White, and Royal Blue is the movie equivalent of pizza—not good for you, but still delicious.

Shin Masked Rider

If you’re sick of cookie-cutter Hollywood superhero movies, then this ground-up reboot of one of Japan’s most beloved heroes deserves your attention. Helmed by Hideaki Anno (Evangelion, Shin Godzilla, Shin Ultraman—“shin” meaning “new” or “true” in Japanese), this revamps the 1971 TV series Kamen Rider. Like that show, it follows motorcyclist Takeshi Hongo (Sosuke Ikematsu). Kidnapped by the terrorist organization S.H.O.C.K.E.R. and forcibly converted into a powerful cyborg, Hongo escapes before being reprogrammed as an agent of the group, instead using his newfound powers to take down its forces. However, unlike the original, Anno’s approach taps into the body horror of the core concept, while also challenging his characters—and audience—to hang onto their intrinsic humanity in the face of a world trying to dehumanize them. It’s more violent than you’d probably expect, often showing the grisly outcome of regular people getting punched by superpowered cyborgs and monsters, but never gratuitous. While those with some understanding of the source material will get more out of Shin Masked Rider, it’s an exciting outing for anyone looking for something a bit fresher from their hero movies.

Brittany Runs a Marathon

When Brittany is told to lose weight by her doctor, she uses it as a reason to take control of her life. She starts by putting on a pair of trainers and challenging herself to run one block, which quickly escalates into deciding to run the New York City Marathon. First-time director Paul Downs Colaizzo based the story on the experiences of his friend, and he highlights not only the benefits of running but also the pain. This film shows that no matter how bad things get, you can still get back up.

Air

Sure, nowadays Michael Jordan is a bona fide sports god, and Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers are still arguably the court shoe—but that wasn’t the case back in 1984. Jordan was a rookie, and Nike was about to close down its basketball shoe division. Enter Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a talent scout for the footwear maker who has spotted a rising star in North Carolina who could turn everything around—he just needs to convince everyone else that Jordan is worth betting the company on. We all know how that panned out, so thankfully Air is more than a two-hour advert for shoes. Damon, Jason Bateman, Chris Tucker, and director Ben Affleck all deliver strong performances—only to be utterly eclipsed by Viola Davis in a magnetic and powerful, if somewhat underutilized, turn as matriarch Deloris Jordan—while Alex Convery’s script keeps the drama on the people and personalities involved, rather than the boardroom. In an age of franchises and endless blockbusters, Air is the sort of character-focused film that rarely gets made anymore, and is all the more enjoyable for it.

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm

Sacha Baron Cohen’s “Kazakh” TV reporter (even if he speaks Hebrew) travels back to the US, 14 years after his last feature-long escapade. This time Baron Cohen has brought his (Bulgarian-speaking) teenage daughter along, with the mission of giving her “as a gift” to some powerful American politicians—initially Mike Pence, then Rudy Giuliani. In classic Boratic fashion, the mockumentary follows the wacky duo on a cavalcade across Trump’s America, filming candid performances by unsuspecting characters ranging from QAnon believers to Republican activists to prim debutantes, all the way to Giuliani himself. Even the coronavirus pandemic, which struck America as the film was being shot, is subverted as a comedic plot point. Baron Cohen delivers, with the expected repertoire of shock gags and deadpanned verbal enormities, and he manages to land some punches at the expense of bigots, too. In contrast to its 2006 predecessor, many of the pranks and stunts here seem more aimed at eliciting the audience’s nervous laughter than at exposing America’s heart of darkness, but it remains a worthy—and funny—watch.

Shotgun Wedding

A raucous spin on the traditional romcom, Shotgun Wedding lures viewers with a cliché setup—a ceremony on a tropical island, with hijinks courtesy of bickering in-laws—before exploding, literally, into an action escapade as the wedding party is taken hostage by violent pirates. If we’re being honest, it’s a little hammy and self-aware in places, but leads Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel are clearly having so much fun as bride and groom Darcy and Tom, whose special day turns into an often hilariously gory battle for survival, that it’s easy to be swept along for the ride. With a solid supporting cast, including the ever-entertaining Jennifer Coolidge as the mother of the groom stealing every scene she graces with her gloriously chaotic presence, this is a wedding worth RSVPing to.

Nanny

Aisha (Anna Diop) is a Senegalese woman working as a nanny for a rich couple in New York City, hoping to earn enough to bring her son and cousin to join her in America. However, her future is at the mercy of her employers, who seem content to leave Aisha to raise their daughter, Rose, while often withholding her pay. As the stress of the power imbalance weighs on her, Aisha begins having strange dreams of drowning, worsened by her fears of abandoning her own child. The feature debut of director Nikyatu Jusu, Nanny contrasts the horror of the immigrant experience in modern America with something darker, while swapping the expected tropes of hope and opportunity for a palpable sadness for culture and community left behind. Nanny takes a slow-burn, psychological approach to its scares, but Diop is phenomenal throughout, and the meticulous pacing and gorgeous cinematography means every frame lingers.

Coming 2 America

Relying on nostalgia to carry new entries in long-dormant series can be risky business, but Eddie Murphy’s return to the role of Prince—now King—Akeem of Zamunda more than three decades after 1988’s Coming to America shows how to do it right. Drawn back to the US in search of a son he never knew he had, Akeem—and the audience—gets to reunite with familiar faces from the first film, before director Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) reverses the formula and tests the American characters with a trip to Zamunda. With a sharper, smarter, and more globally aware script than the original, Coming 2 America defies the odds to be a comedy sequel that stands up to the reputation of its predecessor.

Thirteen Lives

Director Ron Howard’s latest gathers a top-notch cast—including Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton—for a dramatization of the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, where a Thai junior soccer team and their assistant coach were trapped in the flooded cave system. As an international effort mounts to save the children, the challenges of navigating miles of underwater caverns become ever more dangerous, and Howard masterfully captures every perilously claustrophobic moment of it. A nail-bitingly tense movie with some ingeniously shot aquatic scenes, Thirteen Lives is a testament to one of the most difficult rescues ever performed.

One Night in Miami …

Based on the play of same name, One Night in Miami follows four icons of culture, music, and sports—Malcom X, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke, and Muhammad Ali—at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, a converging and pivotal point in their lives and careers. Meeting in a motel room in the wake of Ali’s—then still Cassius Clay—heavyweight victory over Sonny Liston in 1964, the four men discuss their roles in the movement and society as a whole, all while the audience knows the weight of history is bearing down on them. The close confines of much of the film reflect its theatrical roots, but this feature directorial debut from Regina King perfectly portrays the larger-than-life personalities of its cast. Kingsley Ben-Adir is on fire as Malcom X, with Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr., and Eli Goree—as Brown, Cooke, and Ali—all utterly magnetic.

The Report

Produced by Amazon, The Report is an engrossing depiction of the US Senate's investigation into the CIA's “enhanced interrogation” program—how it came to be, who knew about it, and how the CIA massaged the facts to support its efficacy. Adam Driver stars as Daniel Jones, the lead investigator who plowed an increasingly lonely path to the truth, battling against political resistance and CIA interference all the way. Driver is, as is his habit these days, superb, and the film's 82 percent “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes is well earned.

Sound of Metal

Punk-rock drummer and recovering addict Ruben starts experiencing hearing loss, and it threatens to upend his entire life. Faced with an impossible choice between giving up his hearing or giving up his career, Ruben begins to spiral, until his girlfriend Lou checks him into a rehab center for the deaf, forcing him to confront his own behavior as much as the future he faces. Riz Ahmed is in spectacular form as the troubled Ruben, while Olivia Cooke’s turn as Lou, who suffers with her own demons, including self-harm, is riveting. Fittingly enough, Sound of Metal also features incredibly nuanced use of sound—and its absence—as director Darius Marder crafts one of the finest dramas in recent years.",technology
"The poll also suggested a general dissatisfaction among voters with Biden — only 23 percent of respondents said his policies had helped them personally, while 53 percent said they had been hurt by his policies. Only 37 percent approved of Biden’s job performance while 61 percent expressed unfavorable views of the president.

The president has faced widespread questions about his age — he is 81, the oldest president in U.S. history — and calls to step down after his first term. Biden’s campaign has pushed back against that suggestion, insisting that the president is the best candidate to defeat Trump.

Biden fueled those talks earlier this week, when he told reporters that he was not the only Democrat that could beat Trump, and that if Trump was not running, he might not have run either.

The poll of 1,500 registered voters was conducted from Nov. 29 to Dec. 4 by cellphone, landline and text-to-web. The margin of error was plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points.",political
"Whether you’re swimming in a river or diving into the sea, the best waterproof cameras have the durability to shoot sharp underwater. From rugged compacts to action cams, we’ve comprehensively tested all of the top waterproof cameras against our expert criteria and ranked our favorite options in the list below.

We think the best waterproof camera for most people is the OM System Tough TG-7. With a compact yet rugged build and a useful 4x zoom, it’s a surprisingly versatile option with a lot of photography features for the price. Image quality isn’t perfect, but the camera itself is easy to use and pretty much indestructible.

If you’d prefer a waterproof camera for recording quality video, we highly recommend the GoPro Hero Black 12. It’s not the best in low light, but the flagship model is packed with useful features that also make it one of the best action cameras.

Whatever you’re planning to capture, our extensive guide is designed to help you find the best waterproof camera for your needs and budget. You’ll find premium cameras and affordable options in the list below, as well as buying advice and quick links to the best deals available right now.

The best waterproof camera for most people

(Image credit: Lauren Scott)

It’s not a huge upgrade over the Tough TG-6, but with a rugged, pocket-friendly build and plenty of photography features, we think the Tough TG-7 is a great grab-and-go option for most people. As the name suggests, it’s a camera to take anywhere: waterproof to 15m, it can also survive dust, drops, crushing and freezing.

Image quality from its 12MP sensor can’t compete with many modern smartphones, even with a fast f/2 aperture at the wide end of the 25-100mm zoom range. 4K/30p video is likewise a little dated. Yet the TG-7 does benefit from a surprising number of shooting modes, including macro focusing and white balance presets which match different water depths.

Although its 3-inch screen isn’t touch-sensitive, the tactile array of buttons makes it easier to handle than a GoPro in tricky conditions, particularly for beginners. While it isn’t the best action camera out there, the benefit of the TG-7 lies in its practicality, allowing you to shoot without fear in adventurous scenarios.

The best waterproof action camera

(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)

Like its predecessor, the GoPro Hero 12 Black uses an 8:9 aspect ratio sensor to capture 5.3K video that can easily be cropped for social. With the addition of HDR video and GP-Log, together with the returning 10-bit color mode, we found the Hero 12 Black able to capture sharp, smooth and dynamic video in bright conditions.

In the hand, it’s all but identical to the Hero 11 Black, including the 10m waterproof rating. What’s new is a 1/4in thread mount, which unlocks greater versatility for attaching to mini tripods and seafaring accessories. Screens front and rear are handy for framing yourself at sea, even if the rear touch interface doesn’t work underwater.

Low light remains an issue for the Hero 12 Black, with our review noting that grain is evident in dimly lit scenes. Battery life from the Enduro battery was also underwhelming in our tests. All the same, if you want a feature-packed action cam that can shoot sharp video above and below water, the GoPro Hero 12 is compelling.

The best waterproof camera for low light

3. DJI Osmo Action 4 The best waterproof camera for low-light video Our expert review: Specifications Waterproof: 18m Monitor: 2.25in (rear), 1.4in (front) Video: 4K/60p, 2.7K/120p User level: Beginner/intermediate Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (Download) View at Amazon Reasons to buy + Improved image quality + Better than rivals in low light + Waterproof to 18m Reasons to avoid - Minimum 0.4m focus distance - Average battery life

Designed as a GoPro rival, the DJI Osmo Action 4 edges out the GoPro Hero 12 black in a few key ways. While its peak video resolution is lower at 4K/120p, its larger 1/1.3-inch sensor uses bigger pixels to perform better in low light. From our tests, the result is superior footage quality in dim conditions, such as those that you might encounter underwater.

The Action 4 also supports DJI’s D-Log profile with 10-bit color. In our review, we found that this significantly improves color depth and dynamic range. Less handy is how the increased sensor size and wide lens extend the minimum focus distance to 0.4m, which could be an issue if you plan on recording sea life up close.

Physically, it features the same rugged build as the Action 3 before it, as well as the removable battery and versatile mounting system we appreciated in our previous review. In a win for swimmers, waterproof has been boosted to 18m, meaning it can comfortably out-dive the GoPro Hero 12 Black.

The best budget waterproof camera

4. Fujifilm XP140 The best affordable waterproof compact Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Sensor: 1/2.3in, 16.4MP Lens: 28-140mm f/3.9-4.9 Waterproof: 25m Freezeproof: -10°C Shockproof: 1.8m Monitor: 3-inch touchscreen, 920K dots Movies: 4K/15p User level: Beginner Today's Best Deals View at Walmart (Silver) Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Practically indestructible + Generous 5x optical zoom Reasons to avoid - Disappointing 4K video - Screen could be brighter

Almost identical to the Fujifilm XP130 before it, the XP140 features the same 16.4MP sensor, the same 5x optical zoom and the same 3-inch touchscreen. It is marginally more rugged than its predecessor, making it close to indestructible: it's dustproof, shockproof to 1.8m, freeze-proof to -10ºC and waterproof down to 25m.

The biggest changes are found inside the camera. It can now capture 100fps slow-mo in 720p, as well as true 4K footage – though we found the 4K frame rate disappointg at 15fps. It's much more capable as a Full HD 1080p recorder. Maximum ISO has also been doubled to 12,800 for enhanced low-light performance, while subject and scene detection skills are backed up by a range of in-camera filters.

Because the sensor is stabilized and back-illuminated, the XP140 can deliver great results underwater, while the sizeable display makes framing easy even with goggles on. When you’re back on dry land, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity make it a cinch to offload images via the Fujifilm app – or an Instax Share printer for instant prints.

The best waterproof camera for deep water

5. Nikon Coolpix W300 The best camera if you want to go deep underwater Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Sensor: 1/2.3-inch, 16MP Lens: 24-120mm Waterproof: 30m Freezeproof: -10° Shockproof: 2.1m Monitor: 3-inch, 921K dots Movies: 4K User level: Beginner Today's Best Deals View at Walmart Check Amazon Reasons to buy + Waterproof down to 30m + Wide zoom range Reasons to avoid - Fiddly controls - Exposure inconsistencies

Designed to operate at class-leading depths, the Nikon Coolpix W300 is rated down to 30 meters – as far as an Advanced Open Water diving certificate will get you. To match this impressive durability, it features a neat digital depth gauge readout.

With freezeproofing and shockproofing complementing the W300's swimming skills, while 5x optical zoom enhances its shooting flexibility. Vibration reduction is a welcome addition, too.

Its 3.0-inch LCD isn't the sharpest at 921,000 dots, but it's visible enough when shooting underwater. Likewise, the 1/2.3-inch sensor inside is small compared to premium compacts with 1-inch sensors, but 16MP stills and 4K/30p footage are decent enough. Factor in features such as Wi-Fi connectivity and terrific GPS, and the W300 shapes up as a good value option.

The Hero 10 Black is no longer top of the GoPro pile, but it remains a great choice if you want to save money on a waterproof action camera and don’t need 10-bit recording or support for vertical video. In our tests, we found both its 5.3K/60p and 4K/120p footage impressive. We also found it versatile, fun and easy to use, even if its responsive touchscreen doesn’t work underwater.

With HyperSmooth stabilization available across most shooting modes, it’s an ideal tool for recording high-resolution clips in all conditions. Low light does remain a challenge, though, which means performance will drop off if you test its 10m waterproofing in dim conditions.

The latest GoPro Hero 12 Black offers more editing flexibility, while the DJI Osmo Action 4 performs significantly better in low light. But if you want a GoPro action camera without the flagship price tag, we think the Hero 10 Black is still a great option to consider.

The best waterproof camera with a viewfinder

Launched in 2018, the Panasonic Lumix TS7 (known as the Lumix FT7 outside the US) isn't the latest waterproof camera here. Still, it remains relevant by virtue of one feature in particular: a built-in electronic viewfinder (EVF), something rarely seen on a waterproof camera.

The 1,170k-dot, 0.2-inch display might not be the largest out there, but it does offer a useful alternative to shooting with the rear display, especially in bright light, which can make composition tricky.

There's lots to like about the Lumix TS7 / FT7, including its excellent tough credentials. Lens coverage remains the same as its predecessor, with a useful 4.6x zoom range that covers 28-128mm. What lets it down is the sensor, which crams too many pixels onto a relatively small area: Panasonic increased the pixel count from 16.1MP on the TS5 / FT5 to 20.4MP on the Lumix TS7 / FT7.

The best miniature waterproof camera

(Image credit: James Abbott)

If you want a tiny waterproof camera for your next beach trip, we think the Insta360 Go 3 could be just the ticket. What it lacks in video quality and stabilization tricks, it makes up for in miniature versatility: the camera features a magnetic mount that can stick to all sorts of surfaces. It also comes with an arsenal of modular accessories.

The main peripheral is the Action Pod, which features a flip-up touchscreen that makes framing much easier than with the Go 2. Sadly, the Action Pod isn’t waterproof, so you’ll need to leave it in your dry bag when you take the core camera unit into the sea.

At 2.7K/30p, the Go 3’s highest video setting can’t compete with rival action cameras on resolution or frame rate. That said, videos from our review had decent contrast and dynamic range. The AquaVision 2.0 setting in the Insta360 app is also a useful addition, leveraging AI to enhance colors and combat underwater glare. It can’t add missing detail, but it does make a difference.

The best waterproof camera with LED lights

9. Ricoh WG-60 The best waterproof compact with built-in LED lights Average Amazon review: ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Specifications Sensor: 1/2.3-inch, 16MP Lens: 28-140mm Waterproof: 14m Freezeproof: -10°C Shockproof: 1.6m Monitor: 2.7-inch, 230K dots Movies: 1080p User level: Beginner Today's Best Deals View at Amazon (Black) View at Walmart (Black) View at Walmart Reasons to buy + LED macro lights + Good zoom range Reasons to avoid - Small and low-res screen - JPEG only

The WG-60 from Ricoh has some pretty strong tough credentials: it's waterproof to a depth of 14m/45.9ft and shockproof from a fall of up to 1.6m/5.2ft, while it should withstand a force of up to 100kg/220lbs. It's also dust-proof and can operate in temperatures down to -10°C/14°F.

The 5x optical zoom has a pretty broad focal zoom range, from 28-140mm, while there are six LED macro lights dotted around the front of the lens barrel to deliver bright and uniform lighting round your subject – ideal when shooting underwater subjects.

The macro lights also provide other useful functions, such as the LED Lighting mode, which uses the lights for adding light to portraits in poor light, delivering a more flattering look than the WG-60’s dedicated flash.

How to choose the best waterproof camera for you

A key consideration when choosing a waterproof camera is its waterproof rating. If you only need a camera for beach trips, something with a rating of 5m should be find, such as the Insta360 Go 3. If you’re planning more adventurous underwater pursuits, look for something rated for deeper waters. The DJI Osmo Action 4 is rated to 18m, while the Nikon Coolpix W300 is good down to 30m, which should be enough for most recreational dives.

The best waterproof cameras are optimized for use underwater. That usually means tactile physical buttons that are easy to access and operate. Many also feature specialized shooting modes which adjust settings for underwater conditions, compensating for factors such as color distortion.

(Image credit: Lauren Scott)

A good waterproof camera should be more than just water-resistant. You’ll want something with a robust construction that can withstand the rigours of your outdoor adventures. Consider factors such as shock resistance and dustproofing, as well as the overall build quality.

If you’re planning to swim at dusk, look for a camera with good low-light skills, such as the DJI Osmo Action 4, or one with built-in LED lights, like the Ricoh WG-60. For some cameras, these can be fitted as optional accessories.

Many waterproof cameras have housings that limit the range of any optical zoom. That said, some models do offer a modest zoom range, such as the 4x zoom on the OM System Tough TG-7, which gives you additional flexibility to select sub-aquatic subjects.

How we test compact cameras

When testing waterproof cameras, we do our best to simulate the demands of outdoor adventures in the real world. While we don’t test waterproof cameras to destruction, we do assess each model’s functionality while submerged, to ensure that build quality lives up to its billing.

Because waterproof cameras exist to let you shoot photos and videos in aquatic conditions, we assess every camera’s imaging performance in a range of scenarios. We test for color accuracy, detail and any signs of distortion. We also check the effectiveness of any underwater shooting modes to see how well these compensate for lighting conditions and color variation.

(Image credit: Lauren Scott)

We also consider the practicality of each camera’s size, weight and build in the real world. Our testers assess how easily each camera can be used during various activities, specifically those in and around water, to check both its practicality and functionality.

To accurately assess battery life, we conduct usage tests to replicate common scenarios, such as burst shooting and a series of video clips. The aim is to see how actual figures stack up against claimed longevity.

Finally, we test any extra features to see how they enhance the overall user experience, including GPS and Wi-Fi.",technology
"A Gazprom-backed tennis tournament starting Friday in Russia with multiple top European pros taking part has triggered outrage in Ukraine.

Stars Roberto Bautista Agut from Spain, Adrian Mannarino from France and Laslo Djere from Serbia will join a number of elite Russian players at the Northern Palmyra Trophies exhibition competition sponsored by the Russian energy giant in St. Petersburg this weekend.

Top Ukrainian player Lesia Tsurenko told POLITICO she had tried pleading with the European athletes not to take part. For Ukraine, Gazprom sponsorship of the event equals stepping onto the court with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.

“I tried to explain to them what they would be involved in,” Tsurenko said, adding that she had implored players from France, Italy and Bulgaria not to appear at the Gazprom exhibition. “Last year, I managed to convince one player not to go to this shameful tournament.”

Participants from the men’s and women’s Top 100 also include Russians Karen Khachanov and Veronika Kudermetova, both of whom were linked by a POLITICO investigation in July to Putin’s war machine, plus Anastasia Potapova, Dušan Lajović, Diana Shnaider, Alexander Shevchenko and Yulia Putintseva.

“Tennis tours block any information about the war and do not explain to players that they will be advertising a sponsor of terrorism, their names will be used for propaganda, and participating in events sponsored by sanctioned companies is not acceptable,” Tsurenko added. “It will damage the image of the player, their country, and the tour. It’s not difficult to distinguish between good and bad.”

While Italy’s Jasmine Paolini responded positively to Tsurenko’s overtures and pulled out of the tournament, Bautista Agut, Mannarino and Bulgaria’s Viktoriya Tomova left her messages unanswered.

Gazprom is majority-owned by the Russian government and, as the country’s largest energy conglomerate, last year paid more than $55 billion into the state’s coffers through taxes. The St. Petersburg-based firm’s leadership, which has close ties to the Kremlin, has previously indicated it is prepared to contribute more to the national budget in order to help meet the rising costs of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

According to multiple investigations, Gazprom also funds and organizes a mercenary group comprised of its own security personnel fighting on the front lines, with Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko previously telling POLITICO that the oil and gas empire is therefore “an accomplice to war crimes in Ukraine” which should be shut out of world markets entirely.

Alexey Miller, the head of Gazprom since 2001, called on his employees to support Putin at the beginning of the invasion and attends various events sporting Russia’s “Z” war emblem.

The ATP and WTA, which run men’s and women’s tennis respectively, have washed their hands of the Russian tournament. “Players compete on the WTA Tour as independent contractors and, at their discretion, have the ability to participate in an exhibition without penalty during the off-season,” the WTA told Reuters on Monday. The ATP echoed that position.

Before the start of Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom had a deep footprint in European sport, including as lead sponsor of UEFA’s flagship Champions League football competition.",political

This is the rage room!

carlos lozada

From New York Times Opinion, I’m Carlos Lozada.

michelle cottle

I’m Michelle Cottle.

ross douthat

I’m Ross Douthat.

lydia polgreen

And I’m Lydia Polgreen.

carlos lozada

And this is “Matter of Opinion,” where thoughts are allowed. It’s just what I do.

ross douthat

It’s what you do.

carlos lozada

It’s just what I do. So last week, as you may have heard, Republican representative from New York, George Santos, was booted from Congress after weaving what our colleagues here at The New York Times called “a tapestry of lies.” And —

ross douthat

More like a bunch of throw rugs, sort of cast — I mean, let’s not — “tapestry” implies that they all fit together and — anyway.

carlos lozada

They’re a thing of beauty. And more than the tapestry, really, the 23-count indictment charging him with conspiracy, wire fraud, identity theft, and various other misdeeds. His final words as he was walking down the House steps were, “To hell with this place,” which is not how I feel about my workplace. Let me just make that clear. Now, this scandal was intriguing to me, because I kind of feel like the bar for what counts as a true political scandal has been shifting in interesting ways. So what I want to talk about with you all today is what even counts as a legit political scandal anymore. Has the Donald Trump era in American politics changed the way we assess scandal? And on top of that, how do we decide what the consequences of a scandal should be? So start us off. I know it’s kind of weird to think of a favorite political scandal. But I’m wondering, is there some episode in politics that, for you, feels like the quintessential political scandal? So tragic or bizarre or horrifying or just silly, that it stays with you?

lydia polgreen

I’ll go first. I wanted to start with something that was really meaningful, and I was like, well, but like, what about a great scandal like when Bill de Blasio, the former mayor of New York City, ate pizza with a knife and fork? Like, that was a real New York — New York scandal.

ross douthat

What about when he killed the groundhog?

michelle cottle

Aw!

ross douthat

That — I mean, that was —

michelle cottle

That sealed his fate.

lydia polgreen

If you keep it to mayors, there’s just — I mean, mayors of New York City are just the gift that keeps on giving. And don’t even get me started on the current mayor.

carlos lozada

Come down to Washington. There’s a history.

lydia polgreen

But my real answer is, and my real choice is, the Clinton-Lewinsky affair. And maybe it’s a little overdetermined, because I’m the same age as Monica, and I lived in DC in those years, you know, and my entire political consciousness, indeed my entire adult life, has been lived, you know — it’s probably too dramatic to say, “in the shadow of,” but the politics that I have experienced have been shaped by that scandal. And it has a little bit of everything — sex, workplace misconduct, abuse of power, ushered in this kind of new era of impeachment, built the cult of the never-ending investigation and the crusading special prosecutor. There was some woman-blaming in there and so on. So for better or worse, I think that’s the one that has loomed largest over my political life. But I’m curious. Ross, how about you?

ross douthat

So I’m going to pick the Richard Nixon Checkers scandal —

michelle cottle

Of course.

ross douthat

— which is a deep cut, when I was young, probably most Americans would have recognized.

lydia polgreen

Ross, were you ever young? I’m not sure.

ross douthat

I’m going to outlive you all. I’m going to bury you all.

michelle cottle

That got dark.

lydia polgreen

OK, Methuselah.

ross douthat

I think it did get dark quick. Well, it’s Nixonian, right? Trying to be Nixonian. So for those who don’t know —

carlos lozada

Ross has an enemies list.

ross douthat

When Richard Nixon was on the vice presidential ticket with Dwight Eisenhower, he was accused of improper use of funds that had been raised by some of his donors to reimburse him for political expenses. And there was a chance that this was going to be a big enough deal, that he would be kicked off the ticket. And so Nixon went on TV and gave an extremely detailed address, defending himself. It’s this sort of tangled, complex, on the one hand, on the other hand, here’s what you should think about this — that culminates in Nixon detailing all of his personal finances — basically, an anticipation of his entire career as a guy who felt like he was an outsider who never fit in with the swanky, country-club Washington elite. But just listing all of these expenses — Pat sold her interest in her father’s estate for $3,000. For four years, we lived in an apartment in Park Fairfax. The rent was $80 a month. Just sort of incredible. And —

lydia polgreen

What a bargain.

ross douthat

And then, culminating in this masterpiece —

[laughs]

where he says, actually — I thought maybe we could play a brief piece of it.

archived recording (richard nixon) We did get something, a gift, after the election. You know what it was? It was a little Cocker Spaniel dog, black and white, spotted. And our little girl, Tricia, the six-year-old, named it Checkers.

hosts

Checkers.

archived recording (richard nixon) And I just want to say this right now — that regardless of what they say about it, we’re going to keep it.

ross douthat

It’s not an incredible scandal. It’s an incredibly boring scandal. It’s an incredible reaction and an incredibly successful one, because Nixon remained on the ticket and went on to become one of America’s greatest presidents, right?

michelle cottle

That’s how I remember it.

ross douthat

That’s how you remember it? That’s what I thought.

michelle cottle

I feel the need to veer in a different direction. Go for it, Michelle.

lydia polgreen

Oh, thank goodness.

michelle cottle

I’m just going to go pure salaciousness. But I feel it is my job to look outside of Washington and remind everybody that New York can be very special, too. So I am going with the Client 9 scandal. For those of you who have managed to repress this, it is Eliot Spitzer, the fallen New York governor who got busted for spending big on high-end prostitutes. He wound up snared in an FBI wiretap investigation and wound up resigning as governor in March of 2008. So what I love about this is, one, I love the hypocrisy. Spitzer, as attorney general of the state, had prosecuted several prostitution rings. And I also love that this was a good old-fashioned sex scandal that didn’t threaten democracy or prompt a constitutional crisis. The guy was just a horndog. Probably shouldn’t have even been a scandal except, you know, prostitution is illegal. But it was just a kinder, gentler era of sex scandals, and I miss it.

lydia polgreen

One of my favorite details from that one was —

carlos lozada

The socks?

lydia polgreen

— not safe for work, but — exactly.

ross douthat

Don’t mention the socks.

lydia polgreen

He liked to keep his socks on —

ross douthat

Don’t do it.

carlos lozada

Michelle, you were saying that this is a scandal to get us out of Washington. But it’s not. Because it was at the Mayflower Hotel —

michelle cottle

I know. I know.

carlos lozada

— in downtown Washington.

michelle cottle

But the repercussions —

carlos lozada

It is a perfect Washington scandal.

michelle cottle

— were New York.

ross douthat

They reached all the way to Albany.

carlos lozada

So you know, of course, Ross brings up Nixon but doesn’t bring up Watergate. Like, I’ve just — Watergate —

ross douthat

Well, the rule was these were supposed to be real scandals.

carlos lozada

Watergate — exactly. Watergate is not my pick. But since Watergate is so obvious, I’m not going to do Watergate. And I will succumb to recency bias, and I will pick the scandal involving the mayor — former mayor of Baltimore, Catherine Pugh, who — delicious, delicious scandal —

ross douthat

This was a good one.

carlos lozada

— who wrote a series of children’s books, called “Healthy Holly,” and she sold them in bulk to various entities that just happened to have business before the city, in many cases, even failing to deliver the books themselves. It was a pure transaction.

lydia polgreen

Pure coincidence. Yeah.

carlos lozada

She eventually pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges, was sentenced to three years in prison. But the mechanism of using this children’s book in order to facilitate this money flow into your pockets is just so — it’s almost sort of Eastern European dictator kind of thing, like you must buy my book.

ross douthat

But —

carlos lozada

But the real scandal —

ross douthat

Yes.

carlos lozada

The real scandal is that the books sucked.

michelle cottle

Oh!

carlos lozada

The books were bad.

michelle cottle

That’s so harsh.

carlos lozada

I read “Healthy Holly,” and —

michelle cottle

It did not meet your standards?

carlos lozada

— and I reviewed it for The Washington Post, where I was working at the time. And it was not a good book. I even read it with my children to see if they liked it. They did not.

ross douthat

There’s real pathos there, though, isn’t there? I mean, I think I speak for all of us who have perhaps unpublished works of fiction out there.

michelle cottle

Oh, I’m going to need that un — I’m going to need that unpacked, Ross.

ross douthat

That the idea of someone — I mean, OK, maybe she was just using it to sluice money to her family. That’s the most cynical perspective. But the other perspective is she thought she’d written something great that just hadn’t been appreciated by an uncaring public, by —

carlos lozada

Do you think that’s what she thought?

ross douthat

— by harsh —

carlos lozada

Do you think that’s what she thought?

ross douthat

— harsh critics, and she saw an opportunity to get her little work of genius out into the world. And who among us has not had that sentiment, like if only I could wave a magic wand? It doesn’t even have to be unpublished —

carlos lozada

And sell hundreds of thousands of copies?

ross douthat

Hundreds of thousands of copies of your beautiful, precious creation? I find that profoundly moving. I’m not going to lie.

carlos lozada

Oh, my. So let’s see. What have we had? We’ve had sex, money, sex, money.

ross douthat

Literature.

carlos lozada

That kind of —

michelle cottle

Literature.

carlos lozada

— captures — that kind of captures the universe of political scandals. Now, to move us along here, what I’m wondering is — and maybe we could — we don’t have to use the four that we brought up, but we can. But are there any kind of elements, any characteristics, that a scandal needs to really rise to the level of a political scandal? Are there certain hallmarks, or even certain consequences, to your mind that it has to have?

michelle cottle

No, you don’t have to have the certain consequences. I mean, you can have a variety of different hallmarks. It needs to be salacious or consequential. It used to be. It kind of needs to be beyond the ordinary level of grift and graft that you see. But beyond that, legality or illegality isn’t a necessary element, though it certainly helps. There’s a wide range in which the politician can play and get himself busted.

ross douthat

I think it helps, first, if it’s not just an extension of an ideological program, right? It’s good if it seems to be driven by baser appetites, right? Like, if the mayor of Baltimore had been an intense woke ideologue and had wanted all the kids in Baltimore’s schools to read her take on anti-racism, it would have been — I mean, there would have been pathos there, too, but it would have been less —

lydia polgreen

There’d be less humor.

ross douthat

— less humor, less interest. But with the wrinkle that it’s good if there’s hypocrisy, right?

michelle cottle

Always.

ross douthat

Like the Spitzer — Spitzer prosecuting Johns and madams, and then getting hoisted on his own socks.

michelle cottle

Oh!

ross douthat

I mean, that — I mean, and Clinton and Lewinsky had — I mean, this was part of the swirl of the scandal. Clinton is the champion of liberal feminism, and then so the question becomes, what do you, liberal feminists, make of this guy having his way with an intern?

lydia polgreen

And of course, he had been, of course, accused of rape. And I think there’s been a reconsideration of what actually happened with the Juanita Broaddrick case and lots of different airings of it. So —

carlos lozada

And yet, the one we remember is Monica Lewinsky.

lydia polgreen

Monica Lewinsky and the blue dress.

carlos lozada

You see, the blue dress matters. I mean, not just that it mattered in the moment as proof of concept.

michelle cottle

DNA proof.

carlos lozada

But scandals, especially the ones we remember, tend to have something super weird and memorable that just sticks out, right? Like, would we remember William Jefferson’s corruption scandal — — if he had not hidden the money in the freezer?

michelle cottle

Frozen food.

carlos lozada

Right?

lydia polgreen

Yeah.

carlos lozada

Like, would we remember that, oh, Mark Sanford had a girlfriend? First politician to ever have a girlfriend, right? But no, he was hiking the Appalachian Trail.

michelle cottle

Oh, right Larry Wide-Stance Craig. We cannot forget —

carlos lozada

Wide Stance. Wide Stance.

michelle cottle

— Larry Wide Stance.

carlos lozada

Right?

lydia polgreen

Or, you know, Risky Business? You guys — you guys remember?

carlos lozada

Monkey Business. Monkey Business. Monkey Business. “Risky Business”— underrated Tom Cruise movie. Monkey Business.

ross douthat

Also featuring prostitution. Carlos is going to give us the facts here.

carlos lozada

God, I feel so old, because I remember this.

ross douthat

You are old.

carlos lozada

Gary Hart —

ross douthat

All of you are old.

carlos lozada

— was the —

michelle cottle

Easy, Junior.

ross douthat

Not you.

carlos lozada

— was the overwhelming runner for the Democrats, and probably for the presidency, leading into 1988. And before Hart — I think, really, Gary Hart changed American political scandals forever. Because before Gary Hart, the kind of general press behavior is that, as a legacy of the Kennedy era and more, is that the personal life of politicians is their business, right?

ross douthat

Especially when they’re Democrats. Sorry.

carlos lozada

Ben Bradlee, when he would reflect on this years later — Ben Bradlee, the former — the late former editor of The Washington Post — said that the old policy kind of was like, hey, if you’re a senator and you’re drunk at home, that’s your business. If you’re a senator and you’re drunk on the floor of the Senate, that’s my business, right? But Gary Hart really changed it all. And Gary Hart was having an affair with a woman named Donna Rice. And The Miami Herald basically did a stakeout and saw him hanging out at his place in Washington with Donna Rice. “Monkey Business” was the name of the yacht where he was photographed with Donna Rice on his lap. And suddenly, journalism was covering the sort of private scandals, peccadilloes, misdeeds, infidelities — fill in the blank — of politicians at the highest level. Now, historically, we’ve looked back at this quote he gave — I think he gave to Times Magazine, saying, my life is super boring, go ahead and follow me. Like, essentially — and so the narrative of the Gary Hart saga is that Gary Hart dared the press to follow him, and guess what? The Herald took him up on it, and that’s his own downfall. And I believe it’s Matt Bai — in a really good book, kind of covered this whole period.

ross douthat

Always with the books.

carlos lozada

But my —

ross douthat

Print the legend.

carlos lozada

My favorite thing about the — I think it’s in the Matt Bai book as well, Ross. One of my favorites is that when he asked Gary Hart if he had any regrets about this episode, Hart’s regrets seem to be that this kept the country from experiencing his presidency, right? And that — and that — and also, like, look, if I’d been president, then George HW Bush wouldn’t have been president. And if George HW Bush hadn’t been president, then George W. wouldn’t have been president. And then, there wouldn’t have been an Iraq War —

michelle cottle

It’s the butterfly effect!

carlos lozada

— and all these people wouldn’t have died! And suddenly, he was on this tirade about all the ways that having withheld his presidency from America was bad, which is astonishing.

ross douthat

But which is also probably a key ingredient of a good scandal, right? Is that you want the central figure to be, in some way, explaining —

carlos lozada

Oblivious?

ross douthat

Well, either nakedly entertaining, in the style of George Santos, or to some extent, William Jefferson Clinton and Donald Trump, or someone like Spitzer, like Hart, who seems kind of like an arrogant prig, if for wanted, right? Both of those work.

lydia polgreen

Yeah, taking someone down a peg is always satisfying. And we love to exalt a leader, and then bring them down. I mean, I do think that the sex and money is an essential ingredient in some way, although I’d expand it somewhat and — to paraphrase Sigmund Freud, you know, love and work, work and love, that’s all there is, right? So if we think of love and work as being, in crass political terms, sex and money, then it would make sense that those are the things that are kind of the key ingredients of scandal. And add a sort of mix of hubris in there, add some hypocrisy — that always helps. Some delicious details help, too. I’m curious what you guys make of the kind of downward definition of scandal, though, right? Like, the sort quintessential example of this is, of course, the time that Barack Obama wore a tan suit —

carlos lozada

How dare you?

lydia polgreen

— and Lou Dobbs just went absolutely nuts over it. I think there was another scandal involving him eating a hamburger with mustard, which I didn’t even know —

michelle cottle

It’s Dijon.

lydia polgreen

Oh, Dijon mustard, that’s right. And there was the arugula scandal.

michelle cottle

The idea that any of these were a scandal is farce. And that’s what happens when you have somebody who was not inherently troublesome or problematic, or somebody who could keep his pants zipped. You have to go reaching for things.

lydia polgreen

But just — I mean, were these scandals? Does anybody here want to stand up — I’m looking at you, Ross — stand up for the idea that any of these were actually scandalous?

ross douthat

No —

lydia polgreen

Or a trivial scandal that’s worth including?

ross douthat

I mean, I think there’s cases — like, there’s a case from Times lore where George HW Bush was famously reported as being baffled by a supermarket checkout scanners.

carlos lozada

The scanner, yes.

ross douthat

And the argument from defenders of George HW Bush, without getting too deep into Times lore, was that this was misreported and that George HW was actually asking a perfectly normal question about some genuinely novel piece of supermarket technology. But no, I don’t — I mean, I think there’s a pattern with Obama, where there was a slow news week and there was a few days of silliness about the tan suit.

carlos lozada

Was it August? Was it August?

ross douthat

And then, and then liberals like to look back and say, oh, Republicans wanted to impeach Obama over the tan suit — — which, in fairness, might have been true of Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs would have impeached Obama for anything. But I don’t think — I mean, there’s a form of partisan back-and-forth where you’re making fun of somebody. You’re not literally saying they should be impeached.

carlos lozada

You mentioned George HW, and it’s funny that you remember the scanner, right? But we were talking about Gary Hart, and of course, George HW Bush ended up winning that presidential election. He was a man who was caught up in a far more consequential scandal at the time, compared to Gary Hart’s infidelities. And that was Iran-Contra. But what’s the problem with Iran-Contra?

michelle cottle

Boring.

carlos lozada

Too complicated. It’s too complicated. It’s got a hyphen. Like, it’s just — there’s too much going on, multiple countries. And there’s — there’s great books, Ross — — on unpacking Iran-Contra. Theodore Draper’s book — excellent book on the scandal. But that’s the thing. The scandal was too complex and too many players.

ross douthat

And also, it was — it falls into my category of —

michelle cottle

There was an ideology.

ross douthat

There was an ideolo — they had some misguided but genuine foreign policy objectives.

carlos lozada

Illegal, yeah.

ross douthat

And the scandal — no, the scandal lay in illegal means to ends that a normal US government might have pursued. And I think that — again, it doesn’t make it good, but it changes the sort of fun of the scandal. It also creates more of a constituency for defending anyone who supported the Reagan administration’s foreign policy had some incentive to downplay the scandal, which connects to the general force defining scandal or sort of changing scandal in our own time, which is just the incredibly strong incentives for defending your own team.

carlos lozada

So Ross, you prefer your scandals to be non-ideological? That makes them more appealing?

ross douthat

I think they’re more interesting as well. I don’t know personally. I mean, I —

carlos lozada

All your scandals are ideological, right?

ross douthat

I think scandals are more likely to capture the imagination in a particular scandalous way if they don’t also involve a dispute about big policy differences.

michelle cottle

Yeah, I think the public actually does not take to policy-oriented or even ideology-oriented scandals.

carlos lozada

It moves from scandal to debate then, and that’s not as interesting.

michelle cottle

Yeah, it’s too complicated, and sometimes it’s boring, and it’s whatever. But I think —

ross douthat

Or —

michelle cottle

It’s sex and money.

ross douthat

Or it’s tremendously important, but it’s not a scandal the way people understand the term, right? So like, what did the Bush — the Bush administration exaggerated the case for the presence of WMD in Iraq, right? Is that a scandal in the sense?

carlos lozada

Yes.

michelle cottle

No, not — but not classically.

carlos lozada

You’re right.

michelle cottle

But it’s not classically.

carlos lozada

It’s scandalous, but is it a political scandal?

ross douthat

Right.

michelle cottle

Yeah, that’s different —

carlos lozada

Especially when they weren’t alone.

michelle cottle

I think it gets back to the sex-and-money thing. That’s what everybody can get their mind around. And what you need is a scandal with mass appeal.

carlos lozada

So OK, the elements of a scandal, according to “Matter of Opinion,” then — sex and/or money — it’s great if they’re both there — a touch of hypocrisy — Ross that was a great contribution — a sort of memorable touchstone, like some kind of weird element that just makes it impossible to forget. So we’ve defined what makes a good political scandal. When we come back, we’re going to get into whether Donald Trump has changed the way we think about the American political scandal and its consequences for good or for ill. We’ll be right back. And we’re back. So before we talk about what the consequences of scandals should or should not be, I’ll ask the sort of obligatory elephant-in-the-room kind of question. And that is, has the Trump era in American politics — an era I think we’re still in — has it changed the way we think about political scandals?

lydia polgreen

Well, I think inevitably, it has. Because I think there is this kind of omnidirectional, constant, ongoing scandal just always happening that makes it hard to differentiate. I mean, it’s almost this — the chaos theory of scandal. Like, if everything seems like a scandal, then really, nothing is a scandal. And to me, the Trump era has been defined by that oft-quoted — perhaps to the point of cliché — line from “Game of Thrones,” right? Chaos is a ladder. And in all of the chaos and scandal, it becomes very hard to determine what are the things that are truly and utterly and completely scandalous. I think some of them, to me, seem quite clear, like January 6, and denying that you lost the election. Those seem like extremely scandalous things to be involved in. But I think just the sort of omnidirectional nature of scandal in the Trump era has made it, I think, very hard for us to define, like, what’s OK and what’s truly beyond the pale.

michelle cottle

See, even if you’re just talking about what we were looking at as pure scandals involving sex and money, I think Trump has emboldened more people to try and brazen out what they’ve done by just claiming it’s a partisan witch hunt. It doesn’t work for everybody like it works for Trump, but I do think it has made more people willing to attempt to just brazen it out.

ross douthat

Yeah. I mean, Trump removes part of — in a way, part of the fun of scandal, which we were saying is, you’re sort of seeing someone get their comeuppance, seeing them feel ashamed, right? The idea that you have shamed a public figure. Trump, by being beyond shame — it removes some of that sort of frisson. And that’s — again, sort of, his shamelessness is obviously part of his power. But if you just sort of deny the significance of things that are reported about you or things that you or your family may have done that sort of skirt the bounds of legality, it turns out you can go a long way. Now, I will insist in my partisan way that this really begins with Bill Clinton, that Clinton is sort of the pioneer of this. And Trump realizes what Clinton demonstrated in a way that people in the first decade of the 21st century did not. Clinton, by polarizing the debate, by saying, this is — I did some bad things — he said that, which Trump wouldn’t say, right? But by saying, the Republicans are out to get me, you have to stand by me, he was able to roll through even a credible allegation of sexual assault. And I think it was only with Trump that it became clear that you could take that lesson and apply it to a much wider array of accusations, allegations, scandals, quasi scandals, and so on. But you have to have — to get away with things, you have to be able to present yourself as a kind of bulwark against the other side. That was what Clinton did with Kenneth Starr as his foil. That’s what Trump, once he got the Republican nomination, has always been able to do. And the guys who haven’t — or the women, for that matter — who haven’t had the same success have usually failed to make that sale. You know, George Santos — didn’t Santos say, they’re coming after me because they want to come after you? Right? And with Santos, it’s just absurd. But somehow, that line worked for Bill Clinton, in effect, and it worked for Donald Trump. But not for Santos.

michelle cottle

It worked for, if you’ll recall, Jim Traficant back in the day. He was a congressman from Ohio who was just —

ross douthat

Truly great American.

michelle cottle

He was truly a character. He was a Democrat from Youngstown area in Ohio, pitched himself as champion of the white working class, and all of these allegations. He had already been indicted for ostensibly taking bribes from the mob, and he convinced a jury that it was just a secretive sting operation he was running, and that’s why they had him taking money. And then, that celebrity buoyed him into Congress, where he soon, after a few terms, found himself in a similar situation. And he just blamed it all on the elites, who were out to get him, and he would make these crazy floor speeches about conspiracies.

ross douthat

Great floor speeches.

michelle cottle

Ok, great yet completely unhinged floor speeches. And he wound up being — he is the person, the last person before Santos, who the House just had enough of, and he was convicted on all these counts, and they were just like, you got to go, buddy. And then, he ran for re-election from prison. So I do think that a certain degree of shame — and he got percent 15 percent of the vote.

lydia polgreen

Yeah. I mean, I think that shamelessness like — but there’s also something, I think, in this, like, populist moment, right? I mean, think about political machines like Tammany Hall in New York and elsewhere, where their role was to kind of carve up the spoils of government patronage, and make sure that they got to the right people, and the right people were the people that voted for you. So certain ethnic groups were given preference in jobs and things like that. And so, like, I do think that scandal — the corruption and the scandal that it attracts is, in some ways, something that a political system can digest and even, perhaps, thrive on. I mean, you know, I’ve seen this in many countries that I’ve covered, you know, where corruption, in fact, is an important ingredient to the go-along, get-along.

carlos lozada

This gets to the heart of one of the things I’ve always sort of wondered about the Trump presidency — is like, did Trump change the country, or did he reveal the country? And I think that when it comes to scandal, it’s — and the shifting tolerance for scandal — it’s far more the latter, that he revealed it. Politics have become so polarized, that you just don’t mind if your guy is corrupt or philandering or a liar or disgusting, as long as he’s your guy and he’s going to beat the other guy. And again, it’s not new. This is not new. I mean, you’ve mentioned, Ross, the way Bill Clinton was treated with kid gloves, despite his own treatment of Monica Lewinsky. One thing where I think Trump is different from all the other scandalous presidents is in his relationship to the truth. I don’t mean that he’s the first one to lie. Definitely not. But in Watergate, in Iran-Contra, in the Clinton impeachment trial, revelations of a president’s dishonesty were consequential. Like, that really mattered. In “The Final Days,” which, Ross, is the second book about Nixon by Woodward and Bernstein —

ross douthat

Yes, I’ve heard of him.

carlos lozada

— after “All the President’s Men” — there’s a moment where Pat Buchanan, who was a Nixon speechwriter and among the most devoted of the President’s men, is explaining to some of Nixon’s family members why there was one really damning Oval Office recording that meant he was going to have to resign. And it wasn’t about lawbreaking or anything. It was about dishonesty. And he said, look, the problem isn’t Watergate. It’s not the coverup. It’s that he hasn’t been telling the truth to the American people. A president can’t lead a country he has deliberately misled.

lydia polgreen

Wow.

michelle cottle

[LAUGHS]: Whoa!

carlos lozada

Now, in the Clinton impeachment, the fact that he hadn’t told the truth — did he tell other people to lie? Did he not? Like, that was a huge part of the debate, especially on-the-fence senators who may or may not vote to acquit or to convict. And in Iran-Contra, a similar thing — you know, Reagan’s worst moments in Iran-Contra are when it became clear that he hadn’t been telling the truth. There’s that famous March 1987 Oval Office speech where he says, a few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that’s true. But the facts and the evidence tell me it’s not. Right? Lying mattered, right? And if you were discovered to have lied to the public, it mattered. Trump has no presumption of honesty left to squander. So he doesn’t even attempt to save face on the lies. And that is one thing that I think is a real difference, not just in degree, but in kind.

lydia polgreen

The thing that I always sort of have to force myself to remember about Trump is that his primary qualification for the presidency was that he was a reality television star. I know he’ll say he was a successful businessman, blah, blah, blah, all these other things. But no “Apprentice,” no Donald Trump presidency — that, I very deeply, deeply believe, right? And reality television is part of a long chain of, essentially, the kind of infotainment, news as entertainment, factual things being sort of massaged and told to us as, like, this is a real thing that happened, but in fact, it’s all being sort of produced and managed. And I think all of that has led to this kind of blurring of what is real and what is not, what is true and what is not. And I think that that’s part of the secret of Trump. And I think it began long before Trump. I mean, the era of cable TV news that is essentially just people yacking at each other and vamping and filling time and making the most of whatever the kind of hot scandal of the moment is — that’s been going on for a while. But it sort of, I think, reached a kind of apotheosis with Trump. And it’s deeply, deeply linked to his mastery of the medium and his ability to create this persona where it doesn’t really matter if you’re telling the truth, and we’re all kind of maybe in on the joke? Until our democracy is gone, but —

ross douthat

Also a feature of being a real estate developer.

lydia polgreen

Yes. Yeah.

carlos lozada

Absolutely.

ross douthat

These condos are gonna —

michelle cottle

They’re gonna fly.

ross douthat

Right. But I mean, but also Trump, unlike Reagan in that speech, unlike Clinton biting his lip before the camera, Trump doesn’t acknowledge that he lies, right? I think Trump has drawn a bunch of power from the idea that the people who are supposed to be arbiters of truth, people in our profession, the media — that we lie or we shade the truth or we are dishonest. And so he’s fighting with the media and doesn’t give an inch, unlike those wimpy politicians who buckle. He sort of lies all the time. It’s that he never breaks character, right? He never — he never sort of concedes that he might be lying when he’s lying. And there’s this constant question with Trump of, is he lying? Is he lying to himself? Like, what does he actually believe when he tells his lie?

michelle cottle

I do think the bigger issue is just that for him, there is no such thing as actual truth. Truth is all relative. It all depends on what he wants it to be.

ross douthat

First postmodern president.

lydia polgreen

He’s a postmodern president, but also he’s a reality TV star, right? And so the, quote unquote, “reality” is the thing that you present. I mean, like, nothing could be more perfect than the thing that I read in Semafor this morning about how George Santos has become just the absolute breakout star of Cameo, this — I don’t know if you guys have ever used Cameo.

michelle cottle

Oh, yes.

lydia polgreen

It’s a wonderful app where you can get a celebrity to record a little video of message to somebody and you —

ross douthat

I charge — I charge $500 an appearance.

lydia polgreen

Oh, $500? Yeah, that’s pretty good.

ross douthat

Yeah, yeah, it’s —

michelle cottle

How’s it going for you, Ross?

ross douthat

— putting the kids through college.

michelle cottle

There you go.

lydia polgreen

But the amazing things in the Semafor report is that in the past couple of days on Cameo, George Santos is on track to make more money than he did in his entire time as a congressman. And you know, they’re not so badly paid. So he’s cleaning up.

carlos lozada

So when Donald Trump said, I can stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters, was that his declaration of being completely scandal-resistant forever? Is that the ultimate? Was he proven correct?

michelle cottle

Yeah, I think he’s correct.

ross douthat

I’m going to go out on a limb and say that if Donald Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight, he would not win the Republican primary.

michelle cottle

It depends on who he shot, Ross.

lydia polgreen

And I also think he would, of course, be arrested and charged with a crime, and he could run for the presidency from his prison cell.

michelle cottle

Think of the merch.

carlos lozada

All right. On that note, where we can run from jail and perhaps win from jail, let’s leave it there. That’s plenty of scandal for one week. When we come back, one of us will get hot or cold. It’s time for a hot-cold. Who’s hot or chilly today?

michelle cottle

OK, me. I am hot this holiday season on rage rooms, places where you can go and pay money to destroy things and let off some steam. And I think that in post-pandemic America, there is almost no better gift for family and friends this holiday season. Everybody I know is getting certificates to rage rooms. They have been around —

carlos lozada

Oh, god, what do you know?

ross douthat

I had not heard of rage rooms.

carlos lozada

I just googled rage rooms.

michelle cottle

How can you not have heard — Ross, I’m looking at you, and you need a rage room.

ross douthat

I am — I am — I am a zen monk.

lydia polgreen

Wow.

michelle cottle

Moving right along, you go, and you pay your money, and you can buy a package of things to destroy.

ross douthat

OK.

michelle cottle

And these can range from these simple dishes or wine bottles, to big honkin’ televisions. And you just go at it. There’s —

ross douthat

Are they nextdoor to the escape rooms?

michelle cottle

Sometimes they’re the same place. You can do this. No, it’s not an escape room.

lydia polgreen

Wow.

ross douthat

I’ve done escape rooms. Against my will, but I’ve done them.

lydia polgreen

Can’t stand escape rooms. Can’t stand it.

michelle cottle

Oh, escape rooms are awesome.

ross douthat

Are these in the Wash — where —

michelle cottle

Yeah, they’re in Washington area. They’re in New York and Houston and all kinds of places. I think they started in Japan.

ross douthat

Well, that — OK. OK.

lydia polgreen

That explains a lot. That explains a lot.

ross douthat

Have you done this?

michelle cottle

No, but I’ve got — I have been researching these extensively. I’ve got certificates for everybody. So last year —

ross douthat

This is your Christmas shopping?

michelle cottle

Last year, everybody got axe throwing.

ross douthat

There you go.

lydia polgreen

This feels like an escalation, right? Like, from escape room to axe throwing?

ross douthat

I’m concerned about American democracy in a way that I’m not usually on this podcast.

michelle cottle

I’m just saying, in post-pandemic America, there are a lot of people out there walking around with a lot of rage. Instead of smacking a flight attendant or running somebody over with your car, maybe you should go to a rage room.

carlos lozada

All right. Well, on that scandalous note, it is time for us to say goodbye, and we will see you next week.

lydia polgreen

Bye, guys.

michelle cottle

Bye.

いまのところ対応言語は英語のみだが、グーグルは近々、他言語への対応も計画している。これまでのグーグルによる生成AIと同様、Geminiも今のところEUでは利用できない。

Gemini Proというとプレミアムな響きがするが、Bardで無料で利用できるのも魅力だ。ChatGPTは古いほうのAIモデルは無料で使用できるが、最新モデル「GPT-4」には月額料金を支払う必要がある。

Geminiの今後の計画について、詳細はまだ明らかになっていない。グーグルは「Gemini Ultra」を2024年にリリースすると予告している。Bardのアップグレード版「Bard Advanced」で利用できるという。サブスクリプションプランはまだ発表されていない。ちなみに、GPT-4が使えるChatGPT Plusの月額利用料はサブスクリプションは20ドル（約3,000円）である。

Gemini Proを使うには

Googleアカウントはお持ちだろうか。BardでGeminiを使用するには、ブラウザからウェブサイトにアクセスし、ログインするだけだ。Googleアカウントがなければ、Bardにログインできない。Google Workspaceアカウントの人は、Geminiを使うには個人のアカウントに切り替える必要があるかもしれない。

Geminiの試みは技術的に実験段階で、応答で不具合があるかもしれないことをお忘れなく。

Bardの現在の強みのひとつは、実際に機能する場合だが、グーグルのほかのサービスと統合できる点だ。例えば、Gmailと連携させてチャットボットに毎日メールを要約させたり、YouTubeと連携させてあるトピックの動画を探させたりできる。『WIRED』が以前Bardをテストしたところ、こういった可能性が示唆された。まだ解決すべき問題は多くある。

Gemini Ultraは、Gemini Proとどう違うのだろうか？ グーグルによると、Gemini Ultraは「最も高性能なモード」で、テキスト、画像、音声、動画、コードなど多岐にわたる複雑なタスクを処理できるという。スマートフォンの機能の一部として設計された小型版のAIモデルはGemini Nanoと呼ばれ、現在Pixel 8 Proに搭載されており、WhatsAppの返信で使用できる。

BardでGemini Proを試す時は、ほかのチャットボット同様、返答の内容が“嘘”である危険性も心に留めておいてほしい。

"Computers running Windows or Linux are vulnerable to a new type of firmware attack called LogoFAIL, according to a report from Ars Technica. This attack has proven to be extremely effective because it rewrites the logo that typically appears when the system boots after a successful POST (hence the name, ""LogoFAIL""), which is early enough that it can bypass security measures designed to prevent bootkit attacks.

The issue affects any motherboards using UEFI provided by Independent BIOS Vendors (IBVs). IBVs such as AMI, Insyde, and Phoenix will need to release UEFI patches to motherboard companies. Because of the way LogoFAIL overwrites the boot-up logo in the UEFI, the exploit can be executed on any platform using Intel, AMD, or ARM running any Windows operating system or Linux kernel. It works because of the way the rewriteable boot logo is executed when the system turns on. It affects both DIY and prebuilt systems with certain functions kept open by default.

Mode of Attack

The exploit was discovered by researchers at Binarly, who published their findings. The attack occurs when the 'Driver Execution Environment' (DXE) phase is underway after a successful POST. The DXE is responsible for loading up boot and runtime services, initiating the CPU, chipset, and other components in a correct sequence for the boot process to proceed. LogoFAIL replaces the UEFI boot-up logo with the exploit, which then loads during the DXE phase.

The researchers demonstrated its execution and exploit on an Intel 11th gen CPU-based Lenovo ThinkCentre M70s with Intel Secure Boot and Boot Guard enabled and the latest available UEFI update from June.

(Image credit: Binarly)

Alex Matrodov, the founder and CEO of Binarly, highlighted that this issue exploits a newly discovered vulnerability in the image-parsing libraries that are used by the UEFI during the boot process. LogoFAIL exploits that vulnerability to bypass all security solutions implemented by the CPU, operating system, and any third-party security software. Since the exploit is not stored in the storage drive, the infection is impossible to eliminate, even after an OS reformat. This UEFI-level exploit can later install a bootkit without being stopped by any security layer from here onwards — making it very dangerous (and a very effective delivery mechanism).

Macs and some prebuilt PCs are safe

Many OEMs, such as Dell, do not allow their logos to be changed in the UEFI — and their image files are protected by Image Boot Guard; these systems are therefore immune to this exploit. Macs, whose hardware and software are developed in-house by Apple, have logo images hardcoded into the UEFI and are similarly protected. This is also the case for Macs running on Intel CPUs (hardcoded logo images), and so those Macs are also safe.

If your system integrator does not allow for rewriting boot images in its BIOS, you should be fine. But for everyone else, this is an exploit that needs to be patched by both motherboard manufacturers and OEMs, as the research shows both are vulnerable. The only way to protect the image parsing in your system's UEFI is by installing a new UEFI security patch, which you'll need to get from your motherboard manufacturer or OEM (who will get it from the IBV).

AMI, Insyde, and Lenovo, among others, have published advisories, but there's no complete list of affected companies — to see if your system is vulnerable, you'll need to check with your OEM/motherboard manufacturer.",technology

"David Tennant bows out as The Doctor in Doctor Who: The Giggle

December has so far proven pretty lackluster in the festive content department, but we have at least been spoiled for choice when it comes to original (i.e. franchise-free) new movies and TV shows to stream.

That trend continues this weekend on Netflix, Max, Prime Video and the rest, with psychological thriller Leave the World Behind leading the charge on the former streamer, and Culprits making its debut on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK.

Below, you’ll find our pick of the biggest new movies and TV shows to stream on Netflix, Max, Prime Video, and more this weekend.

Leave the World Behind (Netflix)

Netflix has made a name for itself in the psychological thriller category, and Leave the World Behind bears all the hallmarks of another home run for the streamer.

This mind-bending mystery – adapted from the 2020 novel of the same name by Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail – centers on a New York family whose weekend trip to a remote vacation home is disrupted (and we mean really disrupted) when two strangers arrive at their door bearing news of a blackout.

Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke, Mahershala Ali, Myha'la Herrold and Kevin Bacon all star in Leave the World Behind, which critics have described as a “cracking apocalyptic thriller.” By the sounds of things, this could be one of the best Netflix movies of 2023.

Now available to stream on Netflix.

Doctor Who: The Giggle (Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer)

The third and final Doctor Who 60th anniversary special episode, Doctor Who: The Giggle, comes to Disney Plus in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK this Saturday.

David Tennant's Fourteenth Doctor and Catherine Tate's Donna Noble bow out by coming face to face with Neil Patrick Harris’ sadistic villain, The Toymaker; an iconic Doctor Who character from the early years of the decades-spanning sci-fi series.

Plot details and critical reactions have been kept under wraps for this one, but Doctor Who fans can rest assured that Tennant's second spell as the titular Time Lord will end with a bang.

Available to stream on Disney Plus from Saturday.

Your Christmas or Mine 2 (Prime Video)

Prime Video’s festive culture-clash rom-com, Your Christmas or Mine, reviewed poorly upon its release in December last year, but that clearly didn’t deter Amazon executives from commissioning a sequel to James and Hayley’s mishap-laden love story.

Your Christmas or Mine 2 sees the young couple jetting off to a luxury ski resort for a festive family getaway, but things quickly go awry when a booking mix-up sends their respective parents to the wrong accommodation (Airbnb with a goat, anyone?).

Suffice to say, this “instantly forgettable” follow-up hasn’t fared much better with the critics, but Your Christmas or Mine 2 might still provide some enjoyable escapism nonetheless.

Now available to stream on Prime Video.

Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie (Peacock)

Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie sees Tony Shalhoub return as detective Adrian Monk in this feature-length sequel to the character’s long-running USA Network series, which last aired in 2009.

This Peacock-exclusive film finds Monk charged with solving one last, very personal case involving his beloved stepdaughter Molly. Ted Levine, Melora Hardin, Traylor Howard, Jason Gray-Stanford and Hector Elizondo also reprise their roles from the beloved noughties series.

Now available to stream on Peacock.

Culprits (Hulu, Disney Plus)

Culprits, a new British heist thriller from I Care a Lot director J Blakeson, begins streaming this weekend on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK.

This eight-part series centers on a pair of reformed thieves, Dianne (Gemma Arterton) and Joe (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), whose criminal past comes back to haunt them when an assassin begins targeting members of their former bank-robbing group.

Sure, that synopsis makes Culprits sound a tad unoriginal, but critics have nonetheless described this “uber-slick” series as having “plenty of style and substance.” Might this be one of the best Hulu shows (or best Disney Plus shows ) of 2023?

Now available to stream on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK.

World War II: From the Frontlines (Netflix)

The first of this week’s two documentary recommendations is World War II: From the Frontlines, which is now streaming in its entirety on Netflix.

Narrated by Star Wars alumnus John Boyega, this six-part series brings World War II to life like never before through a unique combination of vividly enhanced archival footage and voices from all sides of the conflict.

Honestly, it looks fantastic, so don’t be surprised to see World War II: From the Frontlines crop up on our list of the best Netflix documentaries in the coming weeks.

Now available to stream on Netflix.

Murder in Boston: Roots, Rampage, and Reckoning (Max)

True crime fans, listen up. The second of this week’s documentary picks is Murder in Boston: Roots, Rampage, and Reckoning, which is now streaming on Max.

Produced in association with The Boston Globe newspaper, this three-part series examines the 1989 murder of Carol Stuart and the racially-charged investigation that followed. Episode one, “Roots”, is available now, with the remaining two installments set to arrive weekly every Monday through December 18. Suffice to say, this one looks grisly.

"When you imagine the production process of a Hollywood movie, you probably don’t think of the best drawing tablets and the best VR headsets .

However, between pandemic-related pressures and opportunities to streamline production with new hardware, movie sets are increasingly incorporating the latest technology in exciting and innovative ways.

At the forefront of this change is Felix Jorge, CEO and co-founder of Narwhal Studios. Jorge's résumé includes some impressive career highlights, from Disney’s live-action Jungle Book to The Mandalorian , and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania .

Starting his career as a visualization artist designing shots for movies and games, Jorge later co-created Narwhal Studios, using game engines to assist in the filmmaking process. This method is known as virtual production, and it’s already being used in Narwhal Studios’ work with some of the biggest Hollywood movies and shows we know and love, including Ahsoka and The Book of Boba Fett .

In an interview with TechRadar, Jorge explained how this combination of next-generation hardware and software comes together to revolutionize the production process.

Among other projects, Felix Jorge has worked on the virtual production for The Mandalorian (Image credit: Disney)

Unreal potential

Much like Jorge himself, virtual production has roots in visualization. He explains: “It came from the need to give directors a process to design their shots early on in production. Let's say you are going to make a VFX movie; before investing in all those extremely expensive shots, you would hire a smaller team and design with them.”

So, instead of going to physical locations and finding shots, looking for ways to optimize one physical space and telling a story rooted in the scenery available, Jorge explains that virtual production allows production designers and art directors to “build the world and find shots in the world they’re creating”.

To do this, the Virtual Art Department will build a quick world in Unreal Engine , which creatives can then explore to find their shots, just as they would in the real world. Jorge explains that there are even specific tools for filmmakers that allow them to navigate a set just as they would in real life: “So, if you're a camera person, all your cameras will be represented in the engine and you can place them in a VR headset or with your phone.”

Beyond visualization, virtual production is spreading to other production processes, including in-camera VFX effects, which Jorge says was pioneered in the first three seasons of The Mandalorian. “It allows us to take those game engine assets and use Unreal to put them up on screens and shoot directly into it,"" he says. ""So now, we have real actors pretty much in the game engine.

“That's an interaction that never existed before, and I think that’s one of the most impactful processes. It's revolutionizing the process of the film industry.”

Metaverse movies

If this is all sounding a bit Metaverse-adjacent, well, that’s because it is, says Jorge. “You know, it's funny because it is [like the metaverse]. What's beautiful about the process is that it allows someone who already has a pre-established process from the past to still do what they're excellent at and not have to change it.”

Of course, having things exist in the digital realm does grant certain new benefits, especially when it comes to designing the world in real time. Using VR headsets, Jorge explains that the director can instruct the crew, even down to changing the time of day on set so that everyone can see the changes all at once.

While virtual production was starting to get a foothold on-premise at movie sets before the pandemic, Jorge says Covid-19 allowed the process to shift to a fully remote and virtual one. “One of the first movies we did during Covid was Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. That production was in London, then they had someone in Hawaii, someone in LA, and multiple local people, and they all wanted to stand in the world together and find their shots.”

“We would walk them through how to engage with the process, and how to create your film virtually, and then all they had to do was show up to the computer. It allowed them to have a process that's very familiar and had a smaller footprint, but also it allows them to retain a lot of creative control.”

Breaking it down

So, how does it all come together? Jorge explains that the process starts with the conception stage, where his team will work with filmmakers to break down the script and identify good candidates for virtual production, VFX, or good candidates for a physical location shoot.

Once he knows the scope of the virtual production, his team begins building the set virtually. Depending on the location, he says, there might be assets online to help pad out the foundation. “If you have a city set, that's common, and if we can get all the assets online, we're going to do that. We'll change them and we'll make them unique, but [it means] we don't have to start from scratch. It's cool because it’s a marriage of film and game artists.”

However, for movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, some environments need a little more inventiveness. “It’s such a trippy world. In that movie, we had close to 15 artists helping the key creatives design the world.

“We were working with the director on finding the action shots and the hero areas, working with the production designer designing the world itself. He had an effects artist to help with the crazy clouds, and different artists were working a lot with the VFX supervisor as well, because there was a marriage there between the art and the effects.”

Then, every week, Jorge says the team would critique the world that was being built together, and select hero areas so creative budgets weren’t being wasted. “This is the major difference between real-time and older processes for film,” he explains. “With a game engine, you can see things in real time, you can rotate them, you can apply your craft.”

While concerns remain about the impact of some newer technologies like AI on original TV shows and movies , Unreal Engine as a platform for collaboration shows a more positive relationship between hardware, software, and art – and potentially one that could benefit filmmakers of all experience levels. It might just also be the first sensible use of the metaverse we’ve seen in practice so far.",technology
"The president of the University of Pennsylvania, Elizabeth Magill, resigned on Saturday, four days after she came under fire for her responses at a congressional hearing on Tuesday in which she was pressed, along with the presidents of Harvard and M.I.T., on whether students calling for the genocide of Jews should be disciplined.

Ms. Magill seemed to evade the question and drew intense criticism from donors, students and others, some of whom were already angry that she had allowed a Palestinian writers conference to be held on campus in September.

Ms. Magill is the first president of a major university to step down because of the fallout from the protests that have engulfed campuses since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza.

Here is some background on her decision.

What happened at the Dec. 5 congressional hearing?

At a hearing of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on Tuesday, Ms. Magill testified alongside Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard, and Sally Kornbluth, the president of M.I.T. They all said they were appalled by antisemitism and were taking action against it on campus. When asked whether they supported the right of Israel to exist, they answered yes without equivocation.",political
"Yamaha has launched a 5-disc CD changer called the CD-C603 that not only sports a sound-first feature from the company’s amplifiers but also a CD-switching feature I wish I’d had back in 2005.

You don’t see many CD changers launching nowadays, with the nineties and early noughties very much the heyday for the multi-disc player, following their introduction in the car in the mid-80s. Perhaps you remember the 10-CD (!) Sony DiscJockey!

Yamaha’s new multi-disc machine accommodates half that many discs at one time, but it has a neat feature called Play X Change that allows you to change discs while another is playing. I wish my early-2000s standing CD tower from Argos – a poor man’s Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 9000, and similar to the one you used to see in supermarkets and music stores that allowed customers to ‘try before you buy’ new album releases! – offered such convenience, instead of very slowly grinding the spinning disc to a halt whenever the window cover was opened. Perhaps more sophisticated tower designs (like the B&O) could, but the functionality seems pretty attractive within a ‘normal’ CD changer format. As you can see from the image above, the disc tray opens fully, facilitating changing five discs at the same time.

The new CD-C603 also boasts a familiar feature called Pure Direct, as seen, pretty much as standard, on Yamaha amplifiers and receivers in recent years. This shuts down the digital audio output and turns off the display, reducing the noise interference they inherently cause. Yamaha is promising “sound full of dynamics and clarity” here, thanks to upgrades in the internal layout from previous designs which it says have targeted performance improvements.

Also flying the flag for performance are two design elements found in single-disc Yamaha players today. The first is the ‘Laser Pickup Floating Mechanism’, which pretty much is what it says on the tin: the laser pickup is isolated on a floating mechanism so that its delicate operation isn’t as affected by vibrations. The second is the ‘Intelligent Digital Servo’, which is essentially digital processing designed to detect and compensate for any signal, tracking or motor speed issues.

In addition to the playback of CD, CD-R and CD-RW discs, the CD-C603 also accommodates WAV and FLAC audio files up to 24-bit/96kHz through its front-panel USB input. Things are pretty standard around the back, with RCA outputs joined by an optical out and a remote in/out option.

Sure, multi-disc CD players have always been more complicated to make than the traditional, persevering single-disc alternative, and likely more prone to wear and breakage because of that, but if CDs ever do enjoy any sort of serious resurgence, surely they would make sense as the player to appeal to the convenience of the day – no switching discs every hour, just hours of music teed up. Almost like a playlist, without the shuffle.

Want a multi-disc changer in your life in anticipation (or regardless) of a CD comeback? The Yamaha CD-C603 costs AU$899 (UK and US pricing to follow) and is available in black or silver.

"Suozzi’s bid received the backing of Queens Rep. Greg Meeks and Jay Jacobs, the chair of both the Nassau County Democrats and the statewide party, who endorsed him in a joint statement.

In a special election, party bosses pick the candidates to fill the remainder of the term. Then there would still be the potential of a primary in June ahead of the November election for a full, two-year term starting in 2025.

“Tom Suozzi has a proven record of fighting for his constituents, fighting to safeguard our suburban way of life here on Long Island and Queens and always advocating for sensible solutions to the real challenges affecting everyday average Americans,” they said in the statement.

The special election is expected to draw national interest and millions of dollars in campaign spending to the district, which covers parts of Nassau County and Queens. Republicans have yet to name a candidate for the race.

Democrats hope to flip the district in the special election and narrow the razor-thin Republican majority in the House, with New York expected to play a pivotal role in 2024.

An estimated six House seats in New York, five of which are held by first-term Republicans, are considered to be battleground seats next year, including the one Santos represented for less than a year.

Set in a bellwether and largely suburban district, the February contest is also expected to be an early test and showcase for messaging among both parties with issues like the migrant crisis, public safety and abortion expected to loom large.

“I will work day and night with both parties to deliver for the people to make living here more affordable, safer, and better. I delivered for this district before, and I will do it again by putting you ahead of partisanship,” Suozzi said in a statement.

Suozzi, a former three-term lawmaker who is considered a moderate, left Congress in 2022 to run an unsuccessful Democratic primary against Hochul. He also served as the mayor of Glen Cove and the Nassau County executive.

The primary challenge rankled Hochul, and she huddled privately with Suozzi in Albany earlier this week to clear the air and discuss campaign strategy.

“I wanted to talk to him directly about what his plan was and how he would run his race,” Hochul told reporters at an unrelated news conference in the Bronx on Wednesday.

The meeting included a discussion over polling and strategy so Democrats can “run the strongest possible candidate” to replace Santos, she said.

Republicans knocked Suozzi’s conciliatory approach with Hochul, who has registered low job approval ratings in public polling.

“Given that voters are already fed up with her handling of crime and the migrant crisis, Tom Suozzi prostrating himself for Kathy Hochul is bound to end poorly for him,” Savannah Viar, a spokesperson for the House GOP’s campaign committee said.

Democrats are trying to demonstrate a united front. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised the selection as someone with “a proven record of results.”

And Democratic candidates also sought to coalesce around Suozzi.

Party leaders passed over Suozzi’s remaining rival, former state Sen. Anna Kaplan, who had announced her campaign for the seat earlier this year. She endorsed Suozzi in a statement soon after the nomination was announced.

Republicans are expected to announce their candidate in the coming days. Party leaders have insisted they will conduct a rigorous vetting process when screening candidates after the Santos fiasco of his lies about his life experiences.

Already there have been questions raised about the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees.

Records show Nassau County Legislator Mazi Pilip, elected on the GOP line, enrolled as a Democrat. Another candidate, Mike Sapraicone, recounted a story in April on a podcast that he found a person scary because they were Black.

State Sen. Jack Martins, attorney Greg Hache and Air Force veteran Kellen Curry are also considered potential nominees.

Santos, who has acknowledged fabricating large swaths of his biography was ejected from Congress in an expulsion push backed by his fellow Republican first-term lawmakers.

He faces nearly two dozen federal fraud counts and a House Ethics Committee report in November concluded he deceived donors and likely broke campaign finance laws.

Out of office, Santos joined Cameo, charging $400 for a personalized video. He has also taunted his former colleagues since his expulsion.

On X, formerly Twitter, Santos knocked the process to replace him.

“The level of corruption is so insane that this is what they wanted … remove me the most conservative member of the NY delegation and replace me with another Dem or RINO,” he wrote.",political

BRUSSELS — When Sarah Wiener, an organic farmer and celebrity chef, moved to Brussels in 2019 to represent her native Austria in the European Parliament, little did she anticipate that her career move would put a target on her back.

Assigned the pivotal role of leading parliamentary negotiations on a landmark law aimed at weaning farmers off toxic chemical pesticides, the Green Party lawmaker found herself under relentless pressure from lobbyists — and conservative MEPs — to water down the legislation over concerns that it would put many conventional farmers out of business.

Instead, Wiener aimed high. Too high, according to her detractors.

Initially calling for an 80 percent cut in the use of the most dangerous chemical pesticides, Wiener knew her proposal wouldn't get the support of a majority in the Parliament or in national capitals. But she pushed ahead anyway to shake up the status quo, which she said was being defended by the pesticide industry.

""I know that as a Green, I have to aim high because whatever we propose will only be weakened or shot down,"" she told reporters in March after presenting her amendments to a parliamentary committee.

The situation took a dark turn on May 25 when a letter, signed by “angry winemakers,” was delivered to her office in Brussels.

In chilling terms, the letter — seen by POLITICO — presented Wiener with three options: resign and return to Austria; be committed to a mental institution for at least two years, ostensibly to reflect on her alleged “crime” against the winemakers; or face the ominous prospect that the winemakers might hire a hit man to target her.

“As we are not brutes, we give you the chance to pack your bags and leave Brussels immediately. If you value your life, then get back behind your cooking pot,” the winemakers wrote.

Wiener dismissed the letter and chose to get on with her job.

The law she was working on was defeated in a crushing parliamentary vote on November 22. Wiener and her fellow Greens voted against the final text after it was watered down by the center-right European People’s Party and other conservative political groups to the point of being ""worthless,"" she explained afterward.

For Wiener, the threatening letter and other hostile encounters with farm groups were no coincidence.

Rather, they grew out of a climate of misinformation fueled by the agricultural industry and right-wing political factions backing them, she said.

Sarah Wiener found herself under relentless pressure from lobbyists — and conservative MEPs — over the EU's pesticide reduction legislation | European Parliament

“They've called me an eco-populist, a green Ayatollah, a lunatic proposing a total ban on the use of pesticides, and other false accusations over and over again,” she told POLITICO. “I’ve never experienced anything like that.”

Asked by POLITICO to comment on the anonymous letter and personal attacks on Wiener, an EPP spokesman did not respond directly, referring only to the group's earlier public statements.

Call of duty

The pesticide reduction bill was a key pillar of the Green Deal agenda, a master plan proposed by the European Commission in 2019 to make the Continent climate-neutral by 2050; reverse the degradation of natural areas; curb the impact of food production on biodiversity; and slash pollution.

“This is going to be bloody hard to do,” Frans Timmermans, then-Commission vice president and the Green Deal’s architect, told the Parliament in 2020. “We will ask sacrifices of everyone.”

Scores of scientists and civil society groups rejoiced that, for the first time, science rather than industry needs seemed to be driving policy in Brussels.

The Commission didn’t go “overboard on the science — quite the opposite,” said Heather Grabbe, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. Instead, it proposed a policy approach to do “the basics of what will be needed to prevent the worst impact of both climate change and environmental degradation.”

“This is going to be bloody hard to do,” Frans Timmermans, then-Commission vice president and the Green Deal’s architect, told the Parliament in 2020 | Pool photo by Johanna Geron via AFP/Getty Images

From the outset, the agenda faced pushback from agricultural lobbyists and industry groups that, while supportive of the overall vision, criticized the initiatives that underpinned it — and the costs they would entail.

The EU’s largest farm lobby Copa-Cogeca, backed by the chemical industry, fought tooth and nail to avoid hard targets on reducing synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which are essential to maintaining yields in conventional agriculture but also worth billions of euros to those who produce and sell them to farmers.

‘Environmental dictatorship’

The industry found a natural ally in the EPP, the Parliament’s largest political group, which has cast itself as the voice of farmers ahead of next summer's European election.

Wiener’s fellow Austrian, Alexander Bernhuber, a 31-year-old first-term MEP and conventional cattle farmer tasked by his EPP group with defeating the bill, accused her of colluding with environmentalists.

""Many farmers feel zero dialogue and 100 percent NGO environmental dictatorship. There is a risk of an extreme loss of trust in Brussels,"" he told a German farming publication earlier this year.

Asked to comment on the death threat against Wiener, Bernhuber said he condemned such actions in the strongest possible terms.

“Threats of violence as a political instrument are absolutely unacceptable, and Ms. Wiener has my full solidarity,” Bernhuber said in a statement. He added, however, that the Parliament had already rejected her proposals “with a clear majority and on factual grounds.”

Cherry-picking data from industry-funded studies, the lobbying blitzkrieg claimed that the EU pesticide plan would undermine food production and put wine and fruit growers out of business.

Similar PR tactics were used to weaken other new EU rules aimed at restoring degraded natural habitats and reducing packaging waste.

The effectiveness of the backlash against the nature restoration law “demonstrates just how much the public has not been really prepared, in terms of communication, for understanding why these measures are really necessary,” said Grabbe.

“Some of the claims that we see being made now, that nature restoration imperils food security, is manifest nonsense,” she added. “But you could get away with campaigning on the basis of that slogan because people have not seen much about the science.”

Getting personal

The Green Deal critics had no qualms about launching personal attacks.

EPP leader Manfred Weber criticized Timmermans’ “quite provocative style” and welcomed his resignation as Green Deal chief in September to run in the Dutch general election: “Now that there is a chance that all aspects [of the Green Deal] can be content based, in a fair discussion, and be recognized as good arguments.”

The hits against Timmermans and Wiener sapped their ability to advance their agenda in the EU’s complex policy matrix, where deals can fall apart if they lack broad buy-in from officials, member countries and lawmakers.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen watched from the sidelines as Timmermans took the punches. She didn’t step up to defend her green legacy when her own political family, the EPP, tried to kill off the nature legislation or weaken the pesticides bill.

In her annual State of the EU speech in September, von der Leyen courted their backing, announcing a series of “dialogues” on agriculture and industrial decarbonization reassuring them that the EU “will keep supporting European industry throughout this transition.”

“It’s fucking frustrating,” said one EU official involved in drafting several Green Deal files. ""You spend years working on it and then it just gets killed because of politics or it gets stuck in indefinite limbo and no one is telling you what’s going to happen to it.""

The pressure to kill the legislation didn't just come from lobbyists, the official said, explaining that anti-Green Deal advocates found a sympathetic ear within the Commission: ""Just look at our senior management, not everyone there is progressive.""

It’s not just senior Commission officials: Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski has also repeatedly criticized the Green Deal agenda.

""The Green Deal is not a law. It is a political program, in which all sorts of objectives are included, and which, as is the case with political programs, will be implemented to a greater or lesser extent,” Wojciechowski told lawmakers in his native Poland last year.

Cultural war

The Green Deal now limps on, with several key policies on the scrapheap.

Still, the Commission did succeed in winning support for its climate ambitions, passing measures to speed up the green energy transition, boost the circular economy, increase carbon sequestration, address deforestation from EU consumption, and create a carbon border tax.

That’s already a lot, according to French MEP Pascal Canfin, a member of the liberal Renew Europe group and chair of the Parliament's environment committee, who prefers to see the glass half full rather than half empty.

""The Green Deal has delivered,” Canfin told POLITICO, highlighting the recent passage of legislation to limit packaging waste, set new standards for trucks’ CO2 emissions and certify carbon removals.

But when it comes to addressing the biodiversity crisis and the impact of farming on the climate, “there is still a cultural war that has not been overcome like in other sectors of our economy,” said Canfin. “I regret it deeply.”",political
"When the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 show up, they're going to bring with them some significant changes in the display department, according to the latest rumors we've heard about these foldable phones.

According to well-known tipster Naver (via GSMArena), both the inner and outer screens on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are going to change in terms of their aspect ratio. No other details are given, except that the design will also be adopted by the Samsung Galaxy S25.

The outer screen on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is a rather narrow 23.1:9, but the speculation is that this could get wider in the future – perhaps towards the 19.5:9 of the Samsung Galaxy S23 flagship launched earlier this year.

As for the Galaxy Z Flip 6, the same source says this phone is set to get another cover screen size boost, and narrower bezels too, compared to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 – that phone sports a 3.4-inch cover screen, up from 1.9 inches the year before.

Positive changes

These are changes that make a lot of sense: it means that the Z Fold 6 will be more like a normal phone in terms of its dimensions when it's closed, and of course a larger cover screen on the Z Flip 6 will make it even easier to use when it's snapped shut.

While nothing is certain until these foldables are launched, there have been previous rumors along the same lines – one earlier leak around the Z Flip 6 mentioned the cover screen expanding to a size of 3.9 inches, corner to corner.

Faster processors are to be expected as well, though we've been hearing that the camera setup in the Z Fold 6 might not change too much from the Z Fold 5. It's one of the areas where the handset does lag behind the competition.

In contrast, the Z Flip 6 is getting a camera upgrade, if the rumors to date are to be believed. All should be revealed around August time, if Samsung follows the same launch schedule as it did this year.",technology
"One feature added to Microsoft’s AI Copilot in the Edge browser this week is the ability to generate text summaries of videos. But Edge Copilot’s time-saving feature is still fairly limited and only works on pre-processed videos or those with subtitles, as Mikhail Parakhin, Microsoft’s CEO of advertising and web services, explained.

As spotted by MSPowerUser, Parakhin writes, “In order for it to work, we need to pre-process the video. If the video has subtitles - we can always fallback on that, if it does not and we didn’t preprocess it yet - then it won’t work,” in response to a question.

In other words, on its own Edge Copilot doesn’t so much summarize videos as it summarizes the text transcripts of the videos. Copilot can also perform a similar function throughout Microsoft 365, including summarizing Teams video meetings and calls for customer service agents — and in both cases, the audio needs to be transcribed first by Microsoft. Copilot on Microsoft Stream can also summarize any video, but again, it requires users to generate a written transcript.

Microsoft

The conversation started after designer Pietro Schirano posted a screen recording of Edge Copilot summarizing a YouTube video about the GTA VI trailer. In this case, Copilot appeared to be doing its job perfectly. The user in the recording presses the “Generate video summary” button in the Copilot sidebar, and mere seconds later, Copilot churns one out, complete with highlights and timestamps.

Of course, many platforms, including YouTube and Vimeo, can automatically generate transcripts and subtitles — if users enable the feature. After The Verge asked Parakhin on X if we could assume most publicly available videos (i.e. YouTube) weren’t pre-processed, he replied: “Should work for most videos.”

Copilot is just the latest example of the generative AI race Microsoft is competing in with Google (and others). Last month, Google upgraded the YouTube extension for its Bard chatbot to enable it to summarize the content of a video and surface specific information from it. Just this week, Google announced a major Gemini update that has its own issues — the company’s editing may have misrepresented some of the AI’s capabilities in a demo, and it doesn’t always have its facts straight.",technology
"Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.

BRUSSELS — A court document obtained by POLITICO shows that Pfizer, together with its partner BioNTech, opened legal proceedings against the Hungarian government in January this year over COVID-19 vaccine deliveries.

A spokesperson for Pfizer confirmed the case, which is unfolding in a Belgian court. “Discussions with the government in Budapest continue,” they added.

The document shows that the case concerns payment for 3 million BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine doses, worth around €60 million. The dispute began when Hungary notified Pfizer in November 2022 that it did not intend to pay the pharmaceutical company, citing the conflict in Ukraine.

A judge held a first hearing on the case in March and dismissed Pfizer’s request for a fast-tracked judgment. Since then the case has not progressed.

Pfizer's suit against Hungary parallels one the pharmaceutical company opened against Poland. In both instances, the countries are being sued in civil court over their refusal to take and pay for deliveries of COVID-19 jabs they had signed up for.

On Tuesday, the Francophone Court of First Instance of Brussels held a brief first hearing relating to Pfizer’s case against Poland. Both parties agreed to postpone the hearing until January 30.

Poland’s dispute is over the delivery of 60 million doses the country refused to accept in April 2022. At the time, Warsaw invoked force majeure — citing the strain on its finances following an influx of refugees in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Last month, shortly after Poland’s election, Pfizer said it was taking Warsaw to court over the missed payment, which POLITICO has estimated at around €1.2 billion based on reported vaccine prices. The vaccine’s co-developer, Germany’s BioNTech, also joined those proceedings.

Legal challenges proliferate

The two cases add to a growing body of legal proceedings related to the EU’s pandemic-era vaccine procurement efforts.

In Romania, prosecutors want to lift immunity for former Prime Minister Florin Cîțu and two former health ministers, claiming they purchased too many COVID-19 vaccines and thereby caused damages of over €1 billion to the state.

Belgian lobbyist Frédéric Baldan has filed a criminal case against Commission President Ursula von der Leyen over her alleged role in helping broker the EU’s biggest vaccine contract, for 1.1 billion doses. The small Belgian political party Vivant and three of its local lawmakers have also joined those proceedings, one of the lawmakers, Alain Mertes, told POLITICO.

Meanwhile, the New York Times is suing the Commission for refusing to disclose text messages mentioned in an April 2021 interview with von der Leyen. In the article, the Commission president talked about her vaccine-buying efforts and texts exchanged with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.

Finally, the EU’s financial crime watchdog, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, announced in a terse press release last October that it had opened an investigation into vaccine procurement. It didn't specify who it was investigating.",political
"At Walmart, you can find the Xbox Series X at one of its lowest prices ever. It was recently discounted to $399, which we were excited about already, but today, it’s been discounted to just $349. As of writing, no expiration has been specified for the offer.

"Even in ye olden days, before the internet and before mobile phones, Argos was the go-to place for bargain electricals, homeware, and toys. It’s still a great place to pick up a few Cyber Monday deals. Plus you can order online to click and collect from a local store, for near-instant gratification, instead of waiting days for a delivery. The best of both worlds. For tech discounts from all UK retailers, have a look at our best Cyber Monday deals page, running until the end of Monday.

Need a reliable, quality phone that doesn’t cost a fortune? The Galaxy S34 5G is a solid pick at all times, and an even better one with this discount. It is a much hardier phone than most others in this class. Rated at IP67, it’ll shrug off being dropped in a puddle, and Gorilla Glass 5 protection is excellent at the price. The cameras won’t challenge a Galaxy S23’s, but can still crank out pretty images, particularly in good lighting.

One of these dongles can make an older TV feel new. It effectively replaces the set’s entire smart TV system, and will generally feel a lot faster. Unlike early Chromecasts, this one has a full interface and a remote. It’s a bit like a smart TV front-end merged with Android, as you can install apps and games. This is the 4K version. The cheaper HD alternative at £23 may do the trick for second TVs, or if you don’t subscribe to the pricey 4K tiers of streaming services.

Lenovo’s Legion is one of the best gaming laptop series to head to if you want power, but don’t want your laptop to scream “gamer” at everyone within line of sight. It’s more classy than that. It’s also damn powerful, with a current-generation Nvidia RTX 4070 and the latest-gen Intel CPU. You also get 1TB of storage, double the norm for this series.

We can’t resist a good deal on a LEGO set. This one specifically states it’s for adults (18+) though it’s X-Wing, not X-rated. It’s just a gorgeously complex kit that requires near-Jedi levels of concentration. Ironically, Argos also has a deal on the LEGO Star Wars TIE Bomber 75347 for only £40 rated age 9+ which is fine… if you don’t mind the thought of your children going to The Dark Side.

This is the price for a single, but whichever size you choose Silentnight’s Hotel Collection is 1/3 off today. The duvet’s 13.5 togs of luxe microfibre is wonderfully warm for winter. Plus it’s machine-washable and even goes in the tumble dryer. Cozy and clean equals a great buy.

You can get this portable gamepad in three variants: Spider-Man, Frozen, and Paw Patrol. Each comes with 10 franchised games plus 140 classics. It’s small and basic… but if it keeps a tiny person off your phone then it pays for itself fast. Besides, they might grow up to be an eSports pro.

Argos’s Cyber Monday deals are flying off its website’s virtual shelves. It’s already sold out of the V15. But the Dyson V8 was the best budget buy according to the WIRED team. Its 40-minute max run time is very respectable for a stick cleaner and this version boasts a de-tangling floorhead that isn’t just for pet owners–it makes light work of vacuuming human hair too.

Robotic lawnmowers are no longer the preserve of the landed gentry or even dot.com millionaires. At this price, they finally compete with regular mowers, when you consider how much time you’ll save. This model is designed for smaller gardens of up to 250m² (which is still a pretty big garden for us peasants). If you’re lucky enough to have more land, the Flymo EasiLife GO 500 (£460) is also reduced for Cyber Monday and can tackle up to 500m².

This premium pressure washer comes with everything you will need to spring clean your home and car. There’s even a rotating patio cleaner and special brushes for car shampooing. Or just get a great deal on the Kärcher K5 (£272) without all mod cons.

This is a bargain for a high-end, bean-to-cup coffee machine. It’s slim at 25cm wide, yet boasts a built-in milk frother, to make popular coffees (including cappuccino, lungo, latte macchiato, espresso) at the touch of a button. What’s more, it cleans itself for the ultimate stress-free cuppa.

If you told us a few years ago we’d see an OLED laptop for £300, back when the upgrade cost for a vanishingly rare laptop OLED might have been £300 alone, well, we’d have taken some convincing. And yet here it is, courtesy of Argos. It’s a full HD OLED screen matched with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD—enough grunt for some real work. The Intel Core i3-N305 processor is no slouch either, even if is an entry-level chip. This would make a great family PC. It ships with Windows 11 S, a limited version, but you can take off the training wheels easily enough with no tech know-how.

Will a hotter Nintendo Switch OLED deal arrive before Cyber Monday wraps up? Perhaps, but maybe not for this Mario Edition of the console, complete with red Joy-Cons. Argos lets you pick a free game, and it’s not all cheap dross. Metroid Prime Remastered, Bayonetta 3, and Fire Emblem Engage are our top picks in the selection. The white and standard blue/red Switch OLED models are part of this deal too.

This laptop was released in 2020. While that may seem an awful long time ago, the M1 MacBooks still hold up beautifully today. Apple still sells this very model for a grand over at the Apple Store too. While we often see MacBooks selling below that price online, it’s typically around the £860 mark, not as low as £800. Even Apple’s refurbished models cost £50 more at £850.

We at WIRED declared these our best overall earbuds for working out “way more comfortable and more secure and sound better than pretty much any other workout headphones I've tested”. With IP68 waterproofing, decent noise canceling, and great sound, the Jabras are a top buy at this price.

This half-price deal is the best Flexxo price we can find anywhere. It’s a versatile, cordless stick vacuum cleaner with a motorized brush floorhead to lift dirt and a pop-out handheld vac in the middle. So it’ll clean the car, furniture, and hard-to-reach spots as well as floors.

Meta has sold a crapload of Quest 2 headsets (below) this week. Its arch nemesis, the Pico 4, has finally hit back with a discount. It’s a bit pricier than the Quest deals, and you don’t get a £50 voucher as part of the package. However, this headset does have some of the key optical improvements seen in the Quest 3. It uses pancake lenses and has one display per eye, meaning fewer wasted pixels. You also get three games as part of the bundle: Arizona Sunshine 2, Green Hell VR, and Warplanes.

Some sites bill this ten-inch Android tablet as “for seniors” but really it’s just easy to use. So it’s good for anyone who appreciates large icons, a bright display, and clear speakers. It also works well for children, if you’d like to avoid the walled garden of an Amazon Fire tablet.

This is a great price on a 50-inch TV, the 50GQ5D52DB to be precise, with Amazon Fire built-in, with apps including Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+ plus, of course, Alexa voice control. Add an aerial and you get Freeview channels too. All on a crisp 4K, UHD, QLED screen with integrated Dolby Atmos sound.

If you’re planning to hook your headset up to a PC, there’s really no need to plump for the much-pricier Meta Quest 3. Its greater power only comes into its own when used solo. The resolution of this headset is still up there at 1920x1832 pixels per eye (in theory; horizontal resolution ends up a bit lower as there’s a single panel, not one per eye), and today it costs less than half the price of its successor. The price comes up as £250, but follow instructions further down the page to claim a £50 Argos eGift Card, effectively bringing the price down to £200.

Something in our eye is making this LEGO kit extremely hard to build. Channel your existential angst into the mindful making of this model, which comes complete with Carl and Russell minifigures, Dug, even a squirrel. Aimed at age 9+ but Carl (78) showed us that there is no upper age limit on adventure. The same is true for LEGO.

If you want an air fryer, go large or go home. Its two drawers can be used independently or synchronized to make family dinners easy. And you’ll appreciate the extra 9.5-litre cooking capacity on Christmas day. This is the kitchen gadget everyone wants in 2023. Ninja received plaudits in our WIRED air fryer group test, although it was the Ninja Speedi that took our top award. Argos also sells the Ninja Speedi for £138 (£102 off).

At £110 off the RRP, this was already a good price, but what sets this Cyber Monday deal apart is the free game bundle offer. Be sure to scroll down the Argos product page and click on the Special Offer, to select from the shortlist of £20 games. You can also get a good deal on extra controllers.

A top deal for DIY enthusiasts… and the less enthusiastic. The pack includes a cordless drill, an electric screwdriver, two 18V batteries, and a soft carry case. Put up those shelves and build that flatpack without delay–click and collect means you can make light work of jobs around the house even sooner.

It’s never too late to hype up seasonal excitement. And while children expect 25 (yes, not 24 but 25) days of swag from their advent calendars, a dozen is plenty for grown-ups. Plus this gift will come as a delightful surprise in mid-December.

Today’s the day to buy the electric toothbrush of your dreams–never pay full price for one. In fact, buy two with the duo pack aimed at couples who don’t want to share (or who clean their teeth together, ew!). Unlike some twin packs, this less-than-half-RRP duo pack comes with a handy travel case. It’s £25 off recent prices.

Cyber Monday is here for bargains big and small. WIRED's reviewers have tested many kettles but, frankly, if you're not too fussed about your cuppa, they all boil water. So grab an Argos own-brand bargain for your home or office, in black or white. There’s also a matching Cookworks T3207VE toaster for £12 (£8 off).",technology
"Microsoft is looking to spread the joy of printing beyond its usual Windows userbase with the launch of an expanded service for macOS users.

The company has revealed it will be integrating its Universal Print service to macOS, helping simplify the printer process for Apple users everywhere.

Previously only available on Windows devices, Universal Print allows users a streamlined way to quickly print their documents, files, images and more from a wide variety of apps.

macOS Universal Print

""The native integration of Universal Print with macOS will empower macOS users to print from any app, just like Windows users can today,"" the feature's entry on the official Microsoft 365 roadmap noted. ""Whether people are on Windows or macOS, they have a seamless, no learning curve print-experience.""

The service will remain subscription-based, as it runs entirely on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, making it ideal for enterprise and business users who may need to share printers with a wider base of co-workers.

The tool is still listed as being in development for the time being, although Microsoft says a preview will be available in January 2024 for Mac users to test out, before a scheduled wider launch in June 2024.

There's no mention of ideal system requirements for Mac users, but Microsoft currently mandates Windows 10 devices have version 1903 of its office software or later installed, so Apple's latest software releases should be more than enough.

The news comes shortly after Microsoft confirmed that it will no longer service third-party printer drivers on devices that use Windows OS, including Windows 11, meaning printer manufacturers won’t have to provide dedicated drivers.

Many Windows 11 and 10 users were also recently left puzzled after an unwanted HP app was installed on their systems without their knowledge. The HP Smart app, which allows for controlling HP printers or MFDs (multifunction devices that also scan), was also being installed on non-HP PCs, as well as some users not connected to an HP printer.",technology
"Transcript

I'm British Astronaut Tim Peake,

and I'm gonna be talking about

some of the most iconic moments

in the history of human space flight for Wired.

[Speaker] Behind each of these photos,

there's a different story about humans in space.

Missions being just seconds away from failure.

[Announcer] We're breathing again, thanks a lot.

[Speaker] Secret codes. [electronic beeping]

And taking crazy risks. Well, just because we can.

[electronic beeping]

I guess we should start at the beginning.

The first human in space, Yuri Gagarin,

strapped into his Vostok One capsule there.

[speaking foreign language]

Inside that spacecraft,

there is a code that is secret even to Yuri himself.

[Speaker] Yuri didn't have any control over the spacecraft

at all.

It was fully automated by a computer system

and mission control.

Code 1-2-5 would allow manual controls,

but only in case of an emergency.

There was so much fear in the Soviet Union about defection

that the code was hidden from the cosmonauts themselves

and they were only gonna be told about it

in the event of an emergency.

But actually several people did tell Yuri the code secretly

before he flew, so he knew what it would be.

What you may not realize is that

on the front of his helmet there,

he's got the letters CCCP to represent the Soviet Union.

It was painted on at the very last moment.

The Soviets realized this iconic moment,

there was nothing to identify him as a Soviet cosmonaut.

So one of the engineers grabbed his helmet

and painted those letters on.

That paint is still wet right there in his capsule.

[speaking foreign language]

The launch didn't actually go completely according to plan.

Yuri went into a higher orbit than was expected.

They didn't bother telling him about it.

There really wasn't much he could do about it anyway.

And he didn't land in his spacecraft either.

The Vostok ejected the cosmonauts out

and they actually parachuted back down to Earth.

[Speaker] And upon landing,

Yuri was greeted by a very shocked farmer,

who he asked to call Moscow.

[electronic beeping]

Valentina Tereshkova, first female to fly into space.

Actually, this was part of the Space Race.

The Soviets had got wind of a woman in space program

over in the United States,

trying to see if any of the physiological differences

between women and men would create an advantage

for flying female astronauts into space.

No surprise, they didn't just pass it.

They actually performed in about the top two percent

of their male counterparts.

When the Soviets got wind of this program, they thought,

Well, we're not gonna get picked at the post.

And so they went for their own selection process

and subsequently flew Valentina Tereshkova

as the first female in space.

[Speaker] And the women in space program,

it was just a study.

In fact, it was over 20 years

until the first American woman flew to space.

[electronic beeping]

We've got Ed White here,

the first American to do a spacewalk.

The United States had wanted to be the first nation,

but 10 weeks earlier,

Alexei Leonov had gone outside of his spacecraft

and done the first ever spacewalk.

[Speaker] And it wasn't without risk.

Leonov's spacesuit expanded so much in the vacuum of space,

he had to depressurize his own suit to get back in.

The United States realized that their first spacewalk

better be something a little bit more impressive

than just opening the hatch and poking your head out.

[James] It looks beautiful.

[Ed] I feel like a million dollars.

Also, you may not know that on his spacewalk,

he lost a glove with the hatch open to the capsule.

[Ed] Looks like a thermal glove, Jim.

[James] It is, Ed. Ah!

It's happened several times since.

[Speaker] Like when this $100,000 toolbox floated away

from this NASA astronaut in 2008.

[Heide] Oh, great!

[Speaker] The tool bag circled Earth over eight months

before burning into a fireball

and destroying itself over the Pacific Ocean.

The other thing both of them realized

is that there are no handrails at all

on the outside of these capsules.

They're floating around on umbilicals here, out in space.

And at one point,

Ed was wiping himself over the windshield of the capsule

and his crew mate inside was kind of saying,

Hey, get yourself off my spacecraft.

[electronic beeping]

Possibly one of the most iconic photographs

in the history of human space flight.

If you zoom in,

then you'll actually see Neil taking that photograph

reflected in the gold visor of Buzz Aldrin.

It nearly didn't happen, of course.

Neil nearly ran outta fuel coming down to the surface.

[Buzz] Five percent.

The fuel got lower than it had ever become

in any of the simulations,

in any of the training scenarios.

[Announcer] 30 seconds.

Bringing the lander module down to the surface,

it was kicking up all this lunar dust.

[Buzz] Picking up some dust.

[Tim] And he wasn't able to even see his landing site.

[Buzz] Forward drifting to the right a little.

Was the lunar landing module just gonna sink several feet

into lunar dust?

Were the astronauts gonna sink up into their knees

and not be able to actually walk anywhere at all?

Neil had the cool presence of mind to just continue on,

not worry about the fuel.

So when the landing module touched down,

the only real way they realized they're on the surface

is when the contact light came on.

[Buzz] Contact light.

[Tim] And the engines were cut.

[Buzz] Okay, engine stop.

Tranquility base here, the eagle has landed.

[Announcer] You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue,

we're breathing again, thanks a lot.

And you think, wow,

to have had such an incredible technical achievement,

but actually still to have had so many unknowns.

At some point, you have to do it. You have to be the first.

And these were the first people to have experienced that.

[electronic beeping]

This photograph actually became known just as The Poster.

It adorns many bedroom walls of teenaged kids and younger,

who would just stick it up and look at that iconic image

of a human floating out there, untethered.

The feeling of exposure and vulnerability in that suit.

The risk was palpable.

Imagine if one of those thrusters had just got stuck

in the on position as he was maneuvering around.

That would be it. Game over.

Bruce would be off, lost forever into the cosmos.

And you could arguably say,

Well, what was the point of that?

What was the higher purpose?

Perhaps there wasn't one.

This was just like the jet ski of the spacewalking world.

Just because we can do it,

let's go out there and do it and have fun.

Another thing you may not realize in this photograph

is he was shivering and freezing cold.

So although the poster looks like the most serene,

the most tranquil event ever,

for Bruce at the time, it was pretty hard work.

[electronic beeping]

Peggy Whitson, June the fifth, 2002.

This spacewalk really just shows how far we've come,

now being able to perform eight-hour,

very complex missions outside the space station.

Space went from being a very competitive race

between two nations,

to a very collaborative period in low Earth orbit.

And so having been working apart during the Space Race,

let's build a space station together,

called the International Space Station, as we know it today.

[electronic beeping]

This next photograph is Frank Rubio.

One of the best things about space

is playing with your food and water, frankly.

And when you get a bubble of water in front of you,

it just makes you realize how different

the weightless environment is.

We've gone beyond the days of just building a space station

that we're spending huge amounts of time now in space.

We're using it as a microgravity laboratory

and science that's becoming more and more valuable

by the day as we realize what you can do in weightlessness.

[electronic beeping]

So, fast forward to today.

And looking to the future with Artemis Two not far away now,

the first crew to return to lunar orbit for over 50 years,

is a little bit of a space race starting again though,

because Russia isn't part of that partnership,

neither is China.

Other nations, such as India,

"As he reminisced and congratulated lawyers on both sides, the judge recalled a sense of horror over initial allegations and how subsequent disclosures left him increasingly dismayed over how the policy was carried out in 2017 and 2018. He read from an earlier order in which he said the practice was “brutal, offensive and fails to comply with traditional notions of fair play and decency.”

Sabraw referred to another court filing in 2018 that described how many parents were deported without knowing where their children were. “Simply cruel,” he said.

The government and volunteers have yet to locate 68 children who were separated under the policy to determine if they are safe and reunited with family or loved ones, according to the ACLU. Sabraw said those children who are unaccounted for was “always my greatest fear and concern.”

Under the settlement, the type of “zero-tolerance” policy under which the Trump administration separated more than 5,000 children from parents who were arrested for illegally entering the country would be prohibited until December 2031.

Children may still be separated but under limited circumstances, as has been the case for years. They include if the child is believed to be abused, if the parent is convicted of serious crimes or if there are doubts that the adult is the parent.

Families that were separated may be eligible for other benefits — legal status for up to three years on humanitarian parole; reunification in the United States at government expense; one year of housing; three years of counseling; legal aid in immigration court. But the settlement doesn’t pay families any money. In 2021, the Biden administration considered compensating parents and children hundreds of thousands of dollars each, but talks stalled.

As he seeks to return to the White House in next year’s elections, Trump has been noncommittal whether he would try to resume family separations. He defended the results in an interview with Univision last month, claiming without evidence that it “stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.”

“When you hear that you’re going to be separated from your family, you don’t come. When you think you’re going to come into the United States with your family, you come,” Trump said.

The Department of Homeland Security referred Friday to an earlier statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas that the settlement reflects efforts to address a “cruel and inhumane policy, and our steadfast adherence to our nation’s most dearly held values.”

ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt told reporters that the judge’s comments Friday “said it all. This was a tragic episode in our country’s history.”

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to the ruling Friday.",political
"In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito used the same quote from Henry de Bracton, the medieval English jurist, that George cited in his amicus brief to help demonstrate that “English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises’ statements that abortion was a crime.”

George, however, is not a historian. Major organizations representing historians strongly disagree with him.

That this questionable assertion is now enshrined in the court’s ruling is “a flawed and troubling precedent,” the Organization of American Historians, which represents 6,000 history scholars and experts, and the American Historical Association, the largest membership association of professional historians in the world, said in a statement. It is also a prime example of how a tight circle of conservative legal activists have built a highly effective thought chamber around the court’s conservative flank over the past decade.

A POLITICO review of tax filings, financial statements and other public documents found that Leo and his network of nonprofit groups are either directly or indirectly connected to a majority of amicus briefs filed on behalf of conservative parties in seven of the highest-profile rulings the court has issued over the past two years.

It is the first comprehensive review of amicus briefs that have streamed into the court since Trump nominated Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2020, solidifying the court’s conservative majority. POLITICO’s review found multiple instances of language used in the amicus briefs appearing in the court’s opinions.

The Federalist Society, the 70,000-member organization that Leo co-chairs, does not take political positions. But the movement centered around the society often weighs in through many like-minded groups. In 15 percent of the 259 amicus briefs for the conservative side in the seven cases, Leo was either a board member, official or financial backer through his network of the group that filed the brief. Another 55 percent were from groups run by individuals who share board memberships with Leo, worked for entities funded by his network or were among a close-knit circle of legal experts that includes chapter heads who serve under Leo at the Federalist Society.

The picture that emerges is of an exceedingly small universe of mostly Christian conservative activists developing and disseminating theories to change the nation’s legal and cultural landscape. It also casts new light on Leo’s outsized role in the conservative legal movement, where he simultaneously advised Trump on Supreme Court nominations, paid for media campaigns promoting the nominees and sought to influence court decision-making on a range of cases.

Adam Kennedy, Leo’s spokesperson, said Leo has “no comment at this time.”",political
"The game was revealed in a brief cinematic trailer, so we didn’t get any gameplay of the title or any details about when it might be released. But Arkane Lyon studio director Dinga Bakaba said that it would be an “immersive third-person action adventure,” so we can look forward to that. The trailer’s description also notes that it’s single-player and that it’s set in Paris. A press release notes that Arkane Lyon has “just begun” development, so we might be waiting a long time to see it.",technology
